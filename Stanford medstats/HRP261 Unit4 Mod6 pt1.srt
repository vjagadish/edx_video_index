1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,710
So I've told you how to test for
interactions in the logistic regression

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,000
model and see whether the interacting
terms are statistically significant.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,360
What I haven't told you is how to
calculate effect sizes or

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,270
odds ratios in the presence of
interaction.

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,709
So that's what we're going to do in this
module.

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,590
So this module will get into some math
derivations.

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,190
I think they're, really fun.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,300
They're a good challenge.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,710
Hopefully you'll enjoy them too.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,550
But, there is a little bit of math.

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,840
And so I am going to be throwing up a lot
of exponentials.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,630
And I just want to quickly remind you that
if you have something like this,

13
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,630
an exponential function raised to a sum.

14
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:49,570
That is the same as e raised to e, a,
times e raised to b, times e raised to c.

15
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,090
I might jump between the two of these
quite quickly, so

16
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,890
if you haven't thought about the way that
exponentials work in a while you

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,830
might just want to quickly review that in
preparations for

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,460
the derivations in this module.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,700
So the example I'm going to be referring
to in this module,

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,310
which we're going to use for some practice
data, to figure out how to do, calculate

21
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,820
odds ratios when we have interaction
terms, is a rather fun data set.

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,440
It's actually quite challenging, much more
challenging than the data set you're

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,750
going to have to deal with for your
homework.

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,680
So this was a study that was,

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,890
it was a population-based study about
seven, 800 women.

26
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,040
The outcome variable was annual
mammography use.

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,440
So if you went and got your annual
mammography,

28
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,720
you get a yes on this variable, if you
didn't, if you weren't good about the,

29
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,220
that annual screening, you get a no.

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,400
So we have a binary outcome variable.

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,570
The authors were interested in sort of two
different predictors.

32
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,590
So one, they thought that women who
worried a lot about breast

33
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:50,320
cancer might be more likely go get their
mano-, mammographies every year,

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,100
because if you're worried about it, you
might want that screening.

35
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,720
Or they also thought it was potentially
uh,the case that if you were

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,220
really worried, that you might actually be
less likely to go get your mammographies,

37
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,200
maybe you just don't even want to think
about it or

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,790
deal with it because you're just so
worried about it.

39
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,910
So, it could kind of go in either
direction.

40
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,720
So, they looked at worry.

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,460
The way they measured worry was as a
continuous variable that

42
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,220
ranged from a value of negative 6 to a
value of positive 6.

43
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,450
It was a nice, normally-distributed
variable.

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,400
They also looked at family history.

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,740
So, if you're a woman who has had a family
member who's had breast cancer,

46
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,410
you might be more likely to go in for
those, that annual screening.

47
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,830
So they wanted to look at the effects of
family history.

48
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,900
And then they were also interested in
looking at to see if there was

49
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,060
an interaction between family history and
worry, because maybe whether or

50
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,760
not you have a background of having a
family history, maybe that

51
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,070
influences the effect of worry on whether
or not you're likely to get a mammography.

52
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,610
So complicated picture here.

53
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,730
And I'll show you the results that they've
presented in their paper.

54
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,440
So this, these are the results from a
logistic regression model

55
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,040
that included the following things.

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,540
It included family history, that's, you
are either a high-risk woman or

57
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,180
a low-risk woman, is the other way they
talked about it in the paper.

58
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,060
Included age, included worry, this
continuous worry variable, huff.

59
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,220
But now it gets interesting.

60
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,280
It also include a worry squared term.

61
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,920
That is essentially worry interacting with
itself.

62
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,790
And it included this interaction between
worry and family history.

63
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,110
And there's actually good reason for

64
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,650
including both of those interacting terms
in the model, yeah, which I'm

65
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,800
going to show you in the minute, the, the
picture that was included with the study.

66
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,020
So there's a good reason to include those
because of the graphical display of

67
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,350
the data that the authors were nice enough
to put in their paper.

68
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,270
Now what's a little confusing here is that
the author has

69
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,230
presented single odds ratios for all these
interac- all these variables that

70
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,300
are involved in an interaction; that's
family history and worry.

71
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,750
They've said, oh, well the odds ratio for
family history is 1.14, the odds ratio for

72
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,630
worry is .96, etc.

73
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:05,350
In fact, the whole idea of an interaction,
if there are interactions in the model,

74
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,890
that means that there is not a single odds
ratio for either family history or

75
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,025
worry and so it's kind of misleading.

76
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:16,960
It's not quite right way to present the
data here to present a single odds ratio.

77
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,390
There are actually multiple odds ratio for
family history and

78
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,592
multiple odds ratios for worry.

79
00:04:20,592 --> 00:04:23,370
And that gets really confusing because
they've presented odds ratios for

80
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,956
the interacting term, which really have,
actually, no meaning.

81
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:31,850
So we probably would've been better off
presenting betas in this case, or

82
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,100
doing the little exercise that we're about
to go through, to, to get a sense of,

83
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,270
to calculate the fact that there are
multiple odds ratios.

84
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,250
For the purposes of this exercise I'll
just note we're not really going to

85
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,290
pay attention to which of these came out
to be significant.

86
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,060
In fact, only age and worry squared turned
out to be statistically significant here.

87
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,164
We want to calculate the, the correct odds
ratios and

88
00:04:54,164 --> 00:04:59,848
the odds ratios in, if, if it even comes
out to be 1.0,

89
00:04:59,848 --> 00:05:04,653
the effect size is important even if it's
null.

90
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:07,727
So we want to know what the effect size is
regardless of whether or

91
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:09,733
not it's statistically significant.

92
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:10,485
So in a minute I'm going to walk you
through the exercise of

93
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:11,301
actually calculating what are these odds
ratios supposed to

94
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:11,949
be because there isn't a single odds
ratio.

95
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:12,570
It's going to involve a little bit of
math.

96
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,470
But I just want to show you that one of
the reasons that I chose to, to use this

97
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,620
paper as an example is because the authors
presented this wonderful graphic, and

98
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,660
I'm a sucker for good graphics.

99
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,070
So what they did to produce this graphic,
I mean, this graphic essentially tells

100
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,170
the whole story in a way, I might even
suggest that we don't

101
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:36,600
try to give effect sizes in any other way
than potentially to present the betas from

102
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,240
the logistic regression and the graphic
and not even try to go to odds ratios.

103
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,250
You're going to see it gets confusing when
we get to odds ratios.

104
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,550
This graphic is just beautiful.

105
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,040
So this is showing you the worry on the
x-axis.

106
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,820
The rate of mammography use on the y-axis.

107
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,230
And there's two groups.

108
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,580
This is the high-risk group.

109
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,890
This is the women who have a family
history, so

110
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,360
their family history value is equal to
one.

111
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,820
This is the low-risk group, the dotted
line is the low-risk group.

112
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,840
Their family history value is equal to
zero.

113
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,480
Authors call them average risk because
they're just at normal risk for

114
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,655
women in the population.

115
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:13,070
And what they did to make this graphic is,

116
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,930
remember we have to looked at grouped data
in order to make any kind of graphic here,

117
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,510
because it's every woman either has her
annual mammography or she doesn't, so

118
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,680
it's a one zero variable but what they've
plotted here is the percent of women.

119
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,090
So what they did is that each level worry,
at each one unit different level of

120
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:35,180
worry they looked at all the women say,
who had a worry of negative five in both

121
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,000
of these groups, and they just said if
there was 100 women in this group and,

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,980
you know, 55 of them had their annual
mammography, then they plotted 55%.

123
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,000
So that group had a 55% rate of
mammography use.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,390
This group here was a little bit higher
than that at about 60%.

125
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,250
And they plotted that for each different
level of worry.

126
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,520
So this, these dots represent grouped
data.

127
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,350
A group of women,

128
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:01,650
what was their uh,mammography rate for a
given level of worry in these two groups.

129
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,540
And the graphic is just beautiful.

130
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,610
Hopefully, I'm going to assume, although
the others don't tell us in the paper,

131
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,680
I'm going to assume that where these
curves came from was that they

132
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,000
actually drew the curve by, based on the
logistic regression model.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,880
That would be the way that you should do
this.

134
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,970
So I'm just going to assume that these
curves represent the curves from

135
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,820
the logistic regression model.

136
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,428
And what you can see here is,

137
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:27,453
here's the reason they put a worry squared
term in the model, is that graphically,

138
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:31,690
you can see that there is a quadratic
relationship with worry.

139
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,100
So if you're super un-worried, that's at
the negative end of things,

140
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,218
ou're less likely to get your mammography.

141
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:40,518
It kind of goes up as you get more
worried, and then as you get more,

142
00:07:40,518 --> 00:07:43,488
even more worried, as you get in the kind
of severe end of worry,

143
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:45,830
you're less likely to get mammography.

144
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,820
So again, maybe women who are very worried
just don't want to even deal with or

145
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,990
think about it and they don't go in for
those annual mammographies.

146
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:59,490
The curve, the relationship, the curve
between worry and rate of mammography use,

147
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,300
differ somewhat among those with a high
risk and those with a low risk.

148
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,070
You can see that the two curves are
actually,

149
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,730
the shapes of those curves are actually
somewhat different.

150
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,810
It turns out that the difference between
these two curves is

151
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,520
not statistically significant, as we saw
from the logistic regression model but

152
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,830
they are somewhat different.

153
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,210
This is not a logic plot.

154
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,210
This is just plotting the percentage in
each group.

155
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:23,310
So, this isn't directly from the logistic
regression model.

156
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,070
But that shows you the general
relationship here, and

157
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,790
that's going to probably translate to
something similar in the logistic model.

158
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,430
In a way, again, if you just look at the
picture you

159
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,580
kind of get exactly what the logistic
regression model is telling us.

160
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,880
But now I actually want to go back and
figure out the odds ratios.

161
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,530
How do you calculate those odds ratios in
the presence of interaction?

162
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,570
And this is going to be a hard problem
because we have three things going on here

163
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,380
that make this problem tougher than the
one that I will give you for

164
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,270
your homework.

165
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,720
We have a continuous variable that's
interacting with things.

166
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,050
It's easier to do this when we have two
binary variables.

167
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,856
But we've got a binary and a continuous;
worry.

168
00:09:01,856 --> 00:09:04,560
We have a, a variable interacting with
itself, so

169
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,290
worry times worry is worry interacting
with itself.

170
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,750
And then we've got the interaction.

171
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,400
So we've got essentially two interactions
and a continuous variable.

172
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,820
This is what will make this problem a lot
of fun.

173
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,320
What I did,

174
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,940
though, is, we cannot calculate the odds
ratios without knowing the betas.

175
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,550
We actually have to take the odds ratios,
which I'm going to assume that the way

176
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,430
that the authors got those odds ratios
that they presented in

177
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,790
their table was that they just took
whatever beta they got, say the beta for

178
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,120
family history, and they exponentiated it,
and they called that the odds ratio.

179
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,260
So, for example, the 1.14 they probably
got just by

180
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,570
exponentiating whatever beta came out for
family history.

181
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,810
What we're going to do to get back to the
betas which is what we really need here in

182
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,770
order to be able to do this correctly, is
we're going to take the natural log.

183
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,362
So, I took the natural log of 1.14.

184
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:47,950
That's just 0.14.

185
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,150
And so that's what you're seeing in this
table.

186
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,220
I went through and took the natural log to
get all of those betas.

187
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,470
So this gives the, back the original
logistic regression model and

188
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,450
now we can go back and

189
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,980
correctly calculate the odds ratios that
ought to come out of this model.

190
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,700
So I've just rewritten in this slide what
I just gave you in the last slide.

191
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,959
This is the, the logistic regression model
written out.

192
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,400
We did, we don't know what alpha is
because

193
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,130
they didn't give us that information in
the paper.

194
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,770
It actually doesn't matter because,

195
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,930
as you're going to see in a minute, all
the intercepts are going to cancel.

196
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,750
Everybody has the same baseline risk, so
that will cancel out.

197
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,950
So here is the logistic regression model.

198
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:30,230
We are going to plug into this model to
see what the odds ratios actually are.

199
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,840
And this will take a little bit of math
here.

200
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,920
But here we go.

201
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,430
So we're going to start with calculating
the odds ratio for

202
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,590
family history, the binary predictor.

203
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,940
That one's actually a little easier to
calculate.

204
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,260
So that's why we're going to start there.

205
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,340
So I want get the odds ratio for annual
mammography in women

206
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,210
with a family history compared with women
who don't have a family history.

207
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,170
Binary predictor.

208
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,460
Now, we know that because there's an
interaction term in

209
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,990
the model between family history and worry
that there is not a single odds ratio.

210
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,610
The odds ratio, the relationship between
family history and

211
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,400
mammography depends on the level of worry.

212
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,830
So to make this easy, we're going to start
with this simple case.

213
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,029
We're going to start with a case where
we're at a level of worry equals zero.

214
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:18,860
Depending on what worry is, the odds ratio
for family history is going to change.

215
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,920
So all we can do, is sort of calculate it
for different levels of worry.

216
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,810
So imagine we're at a level of worry of
zero.

217
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,610
I'm starting with worry of zero because
that makes things cancel out of the model.

218
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,810
Well what is an odds ratio?

219
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,900
An odds ration is a ratio of two odds.

220
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:42,000
In the numerator we're going to get at the
odds of annual mammography use for

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,615
women with a family history.

222
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:50,570
And we want to compare that to the odds
for women with a family history,

223
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,170
with the, without a family history, family
history is equal to zero.

224
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,830
So that's what we want to put.

225
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,030
Well, where do we get the odds from?

226
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,310
We plug into the logistic regression model
to get the odds for

227
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,780
each of those types of women.

228
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,950
So that's what I'm going to do now.

229
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,840
So what about the odds for a woman with
family history.

230
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,990
So her odds based on the model, I'm just
exponentiating both sides here based on

231
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,180
the model is e raised to alpha, alpha's
going to cancel so it doesn't matter what

232
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,864
it is, plus 0.14 times 1 because she has a
family history, minus 0.03.

233
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:25,640
I'm going to, this is for, this is age.

234
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,110
But I'm just going to plus in an age of
50.

235
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,880
It actually doesn't matter what I plug in
here,

236
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,850
because we are calculating the adjusted
odds ratio.

237
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,370
So what we're going to do is we're
going to hold age fixed.

238
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,850
Whatever we, whatever the age of the woman
in the numerator,

239
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,190
we're going to give the same age to the
woman in the denominator.

240
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,540
That's what it means to adjust for age.

241
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,390
We're holding it fixed.

242
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,080
We're comparing only 50 year olds to 50
years olds.

243
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,690
I can put any number in for age as long as
I hold it constant.

244
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,740
Then we get negative 0.04 times Worry.

245
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,409
Well, what's Worry here?

246
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:55,061
It's zero.

247
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:58,895
Then we get negative .03 times worry
squared while, again,

248
00:12:58,895 --> 00:13:00,600
zero squared is just zero.

249
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,190
And then we get negative .02 times, times,
worr, times the interaction between worry

250
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,715
and family history while worry is zero
that also goes to zero.

251
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:10,030
So you can see a lot of things are
going to drop out here.

252
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,340
Now I'm just going to re-write something
here.

253
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,420
I am going to just remind you that we can,
this,

254
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,110
it will easier to see that things cancel
if I actually go through and

255
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:24,410
say, well this is the same as multiplying
by e raised to each of these things.

256
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,320
That'll just be easier for

257
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,150
you to see that when I'm cancelling things
that I'm justified in doing, so.

258
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:33,370
So, all of this is the same as multiplying
e raised to alpha plus 0.14 is the same as

259
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,762
e raised to alpha times e raised to 0.14.

260
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:37,570
Now what goes in the denominator?

261
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,370
So, now we want to compare to a woman who
does not have a family history.

262
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,449
So, she gets for the family history term,
a value of zero.

263
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,760
We're going to hold age fixed, so she gets
the same value for age.

264
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,090
We're going to uh,give her a value of zero
for worry,

265
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:58,090
because we're saying this is at, comparing
two women who have a worry of zero, so

266
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,040
all the values of worry, this is, are all
going to be zero, so

267
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,030
that's going to make this problem a little
easier.

268
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,340
So worry go- is at zero, we're, we're
saying this is the odds ratio at

269
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,590
a worry of zero, so we get- we're noticing
that a lot of things cancel here.

270
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,950
So e raised to alpha, that's going to
cancel for

271
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:17,130
both women, this differs between the
women, so she gets

272
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,790
e raised to .14 in the numerator, that's e
raised to zero in the denominator.

273
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,160
The term for age is going to cancel, we're
holding age fixed, so

274
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,080
there should be no additional effect for
age.

275
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,990
And then since worry is held at zero, all
these things are just zero,

276
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,430
they're all going to cancel.

277
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,030
That makes our life a little bit easier
here.

278
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,640
So what is this simplified to?

279
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,250
This simplifies just to e raised to 0.14,

280
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,040
e raised to zero in the denominator here,
e raised to zero is just one.

281
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,210
So this turns out to be just e raised to
.14.

282
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:49,010
So at a worry of zero, all we have to do
is take the beta for family history and

283
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,710
exponentiate it, and that gives us the
odds ratio of 1.14.

284
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,570
Now that's what the authors reported in
their paper, but

285
00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:00,240
that's only the odds ratio when women are
at a worry level of zero.

286
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,330
So we actually need to do a little bit
more work to figure out what

287
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,560
the general formula for

288
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,420
the odds ratio is here, because the odds
ration is actually a function of worry.

289
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,210
So, I'm going to do one more example, and
the we can just, just general it.

290
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,170
So, what if I am instead at a worry level
of say, five.

291
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,480
I could just pic any value here but we're
going to generalize this in a minute.

292
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,630
So if I'm at a worry level of 5, I'm
going to go through the same logic,

293
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,230
except some terms are not going to cancel
out anymore.

294
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,040
So family history, odds ratio for family
history, for mammography use,

295
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,690
let me compare a woman with a family
history, so

296
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,830
she gets the following values, e raised
to, it doesn't matter what age is,

297
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:43,430
I'm going to cancel that out anyway,
because we're going to hold it fixed.

298
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,390
But now we have to put in something for
worry.

299
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,870
So she gets a value of 5 for worry, a
value of 25 for

300
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:55,890
worry squared, and for the interaction
term she has a worry value of 5 and

301
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,400
she has a family history, so 5 times 1 is
equal to 5,

302
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,680
so her interaction term, she gets an
interaction term of 5.

303
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,290
What about the woman who does not have a
family history that we're comparing to?

304
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,390
So in the denominator the odds for a woman
who does not have a family history but

305
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,930
is at a level of worry five, she's getting
e raised to alpha.

306
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,230
She's getting e raised to 0.14 times 0,
because she doesn't have a family history.

307
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,030
So her value there is 0.

308
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,460
Again, we're just holding age fixed, so
that's going to be the same for both.

309
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:32,440
Now, she also has a worry level of 5, and
she also has a worry squared of 25.

310
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,700
However, for the interaction, she has a
value of zero for

311
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:43,180
family history so her interaction is going
to be 5 times zero, or zero.

312
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,730
So, she's actually going to get a zero
there.

313
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,420
Now let's go and see what things cancel.

314
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,450
So, the alpha is going to cancel.

315
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,280
The age term is going to cancel.

316
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,650
The main effect for worry and the main
effect for worry squared are going to

317
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,460
cancel, because those are the same since
worry is held fixed.

318
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,593
But, we're going to have this additional
term here from the interaction.

319
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:09,180
E zero raised to zero goes to 1.

320
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,050
So we get, this is what's left, we get
that the odds ratio here

321
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,510
is equal to e raised to .14,

322
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:24,720
this e raised to 0 goes to 1, minus e,
times e raised to point 1,

323
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,396
oh this is .02 times 5 is .10, or we can
rewrite that as e raised to .14 minus .10.

324
00:17:30,396 --> 00:17:33,150
So I've just simplified this, let me
simplify a little further,

325
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:39,290
I get that it's e raised to .04, which is
equal to 1.04.

326
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,970
So what happened here is at a higher level
of worry,

327
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,250
family history actually matters less, the
odds ratio for

328
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,740
family is closer to 1 when we get to a
higher level of worry.

329
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,250
And we've gotta go back to the picture
here, we can see,

330
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:02,500
let me just take you back to the picture,
that at higher level of,

331
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,520
worry, that the difference and, and
different levels of worry,

332
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,140
the effect of family history differs, and
that's what's captured here.

333
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,860
And we can even make this into a general
formula.

334
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,170
So, you'll notice that all I did here,

335
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:19,090
the, the odds ratio in general is going to
be e raised to 0.14.

336
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,030
So, we're always going to have that e
raised to 0.14,

337
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,860
but then it's going to be minus 0.02 times
whatever the worry level is.

338
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,730
So, I happen to have a worry level of five
here, but if I had a worry,

339
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,070
a different worry level you would see that
captured, you could just plug in that w.

340
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,790
If the worry is zero, you're plugging in
zero, so that's why at zero it

341
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:42,270
becomes an odds ratio of 1.14, but that is
the general formula, for, and

342
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,950
there's an infinite number of odds ratios
here depending on the level of worry.

343
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,100
What if somebody had a level of worry of
negative 5,

344
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,604
well if you had a level of worry of
negative 5, this would be .14 minus .02

345
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:59,465
times minus 5 would be plus .10, so that
would come out to be e raised to

346
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:05,450
.24 Which is going to be an odds ratio of
around, it's a little bit more than 1.25.

347
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,610
So that's going to be a little bit higher.

348
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,770
So if you're at a lower level of worry,

349
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,100
then your family history is is mattering
more.

350
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,240
So that's what the, the model is telling
us.

351
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,500
There is a function, the odds ratio is a
function of worry here.
