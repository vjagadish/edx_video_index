1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,080
Welcome to the first R module.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,390
In this video, we'll be going over the
solutions to the first R exercise.

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,014
If you prefer,

4
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:14,880
there's also a written version of these
solutions on the class website.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,326
Now, this first R exercise was really
designed to get you to

6
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:22,310
explore the different options and deducer.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,390
So if you found yourself struggling a
little bit, don't worry.

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,860
It's going to get easier from here.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,585
So, the first step is actually not
question one.

10
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:34,790
The first thing we need to do is open up
deducer.

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,564
So to do that, I'm going to click this
short cut.

12
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:42,150
And there are two windows here.

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,498
There's the console window on the left,
and the data viewer window on the.

14
00:00:45,498 --> 00:00:48,138
On the right, in order to open up my data,

15
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:54,627
which is provided to you as an Excel file
on the class website.

16
00:00:54,627 --> 00:00:59,255
I'm going to click on the Open Data icon
on the Data Viewer window,

17
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:03,840
on the right hand side of the screen.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,740
This will allow you to navigate to
wherever you have that Excel file saved.

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,445
In my case, it happens to be on the
desktop, and I’m going to select it and

20
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:13,090
open it.

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,064
Because our data is only on one worksheet,
the first one,

22
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:16,810
I’m just going to click OK here.

23
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:23,520
And I see that deducer was able to To load
in the data correctly.

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,840
I'm going to scroll to the right, make
sure everything is there, good.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,110
I'm going to scroll down, to make sure I
have 50 rows.

26
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,200
Great.
So at this point we are now ready to

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,050
start the exercise.

28
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,714
The first question reads that varsity,

29
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:42,410
the variable varsity is currently stored
as type double.

30
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,845
We want to change this continuous variable
to a categorical variable.

31
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:49,950
R denotes categorical variables as
factors.

32
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,850
The way we're going to do this is using
the Data Viewer window on the right

33
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,140
hand side.

34
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,604
I'm going to click on Variable View here,

35
00:01:56,604 --> 00:02:00,933
which will list all the variables in a
column.

36
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:04,865
Along with their type, and something
called factor levels.

37
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:09,800
And so, [COUGH] I'm going to go to
Varsity,

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,390
click on Type, and then select Factor.

39
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,355
And notice when I do this, that the factor
levels column gets populated for

40
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:22,170
that variable.

41
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,670
It shows two factor levels, level zero and
level one.

42
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,030
And that's because varsity only has two
values in it.

43
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,705
I do want to caution you, that,

44
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:38,096
when you're doing variable conversions in
deducer like I did just now.

45
00:02:38,096 --> 00:02:41,170
That you don't go back and forth too many
times.

46
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,976
Because deducer will make assumptions
about what types of variables you want.

47
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:49,870
And what you want certain values to be.

48
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,760
So just be aware, that deducer makes
certain assumptions.

49
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,190
And to always check your data, after
changing anything.

50
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,000
For questions two we want to sort two
different variables.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,540
Varsity and writing login different
orders.

52
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,490
So, first we want to sort varsity in
ascending order.

53
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,255
And then writing log in descending order.

54
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:17,820
Okay, so the way I'm going to do that.

55
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,853
I'm going to click back to Data View for
now.

56
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:23,505
The way I'm going to do this is by going
now to the Console window on

57
00:03:23,505 --> 00:03:27,610
the left hand side here, and then clicking
on Data, then Sort.

58
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:34,450
This brings up a new window, the Sort Data
frame, and what this allows

59
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:45,020
us to do Is sort data in either ascending
or descending order.

60
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,901
So I'm going to click on Varsity, and then
move it over.

61
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:50,760
And then also move over WritingLove.

62
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,040
You can also just drag these variables
over, and

63
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:01,147
varsity is in ascending order, or
increasing here, and that's what we want.

64
00:04:01,147 --> 00:04:04,451
But we want WritingLove in decreasing
order, so what I'm going to do is

65
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:09,270
highlight WritingLove, and then click the
button on the left here.

66
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,910
And that will change writing love to
decreasing, as you see.

67
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:17,850
Now, before I hit OK, it's important to
visualize what's going to happen.

68
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,660
So, we know varsity only has two levels,
right?

69
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,880
Or two different values, zero and one.

70
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,652
And so what this is going to do is
organize varsity,

71
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:32,092
such that all the zeros are on top, and
the ones are all on the bottom.

72
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:35,446
And then for each category.

73
00:04:35,446 --> 00:04:38,562
So, within all the rows for which varsity
is zero,

74
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:45,250
writing love is going to be organized in
descending order in decreasing order.

75
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,745
And then again for varsity, for rows that
have a varsity value of one.

76
00:04:50,745 --> 00:04:55,620
Writing love is, once again, going to be
ordered in decreasing value.

77
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,212
So we should see a jump, in WritingLove,

78
00:04:58,212 --> 00:05:03,795
in the values of writing love when varsity
changes from zero to one.

79
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:05,905
Okay, so I'm going to hit OK.

80
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:09,460
And we'll see if that actually happens.

81
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,270
Great.

82
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,440
So the data changed here.

83
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,350
[COUGH].
We see Varsity.

84
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,140
So as you can see here, all the zeros were
grouped together.

85
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,504
And all the ones were grouped together
for, the varsity variable, and

86
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:28,690
all the zeroes were put first because we
wanted varsity in ascending order.

87
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,755
We want them to go from zero to one.

88
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:36,011
And the other thing I want you to notice
is that the row numbers on

89
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:43,880
the left-hand side here are all jumbled
up, because the original row numbers.

90
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,000
Stuck with each row as it was sorted by R.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,574
So then let's keep that in mind,

92
00:05:50,574 --> 00:05:57,740
that varsity switches from 0 to 1 between
ID 31 and 30, here.

93
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,310
And then go look at what happened to
WritingLove.

94
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:05,270
So I'm going to scroll to the right, and
we see that WritingLove is sorted in

95
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:11,719
descending order until we hit between row
31 and 30 here.

96
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:13,923
Where it goes from 20 to 19 to 10, and

97
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:19,410
then there's two cells With missing values
denoted as na.

98
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,680
And then we start over at 98.

99
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,750
And then, again WritingLove is sorted in
descending value.

100
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:32,210
So, I'd like to talk a little bit about
missing values, in R.

101
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,955
So, note that missing values are denoted
as NA.

102
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:39,660
The important distinction here, between R
and

103
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:47,846
other statistical programming packages,
like for example, SAS or STATA.

104
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:53,702
Or SPSS, whatever you might use, is that
na is not given a value in r.

105
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:58,460
In those other packages missing values are
given either a very, very,

106
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:05,060
very large positive value, or a very,
very, very large negative value.

107
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,820
And there are reasons for this, but it's
important to know that in r,

108
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,980
missing is just missing and it's not given
a large value.

109
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,887
Moving on to question three, question
three reads, filter the data,

110
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:21,520
such that you create a dataset.

111
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,417
With only records of students who have
MathLove scores greater than or

112
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:28,500
equal to 70.

113
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,998
So what we're going to do is go to the
Console window, go to Data, and

114
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:34,319
then select Subset.

115
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,229
What this is going to allow us to do,

116
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:41,340
is to create an expression that selects
only for those students.

117
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,900
So first I'm going to double click on
Mathlove, and

118
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:49,310
when I do that you'll see Mathlove
populate the subset expression box.

119
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,590
And then we have all these logical
operators over here.

120
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,494
And, we're going to want to select the
greater than or

121
00:07:56,494 --> 00:08:00,725
equal to button, for greater than or equal
to 70.

122
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:04,340
And then we can simply type in 7,0, and
hit OK.

123
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:09,530
So what did this do?

124
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,759
It essentially created a new dataset.

125
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,600
For students or IDs that satisfy that
condition.

126
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,211
If we go to the Data Viewer window now, on
the right hand side, and under Dataset.

127
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:26,006
We click the drop-down menu, we see that
there are two options now,

128
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:32,310
Mock Class Data, which was our original
dataset, and now mock.class.data.sub.

129
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,050
And selecting that second dataset,

130
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:38,165
we see that it's a truncated version of
our original dataset.

131
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:42,675
And if we scroll over to the right, we
notice that all the values for

132
00:08:42,675 --> 00:08:47,293
Mathlove are greater than or equal to 70.

133
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,436
Question four reads click on Extras,
Extras then Data Summary, for

134
00:08:55,436 --> 00:09:00,020
a quick summary of all the variables in
your dataset.

135
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,915
How many missing values does Carter have?

136
00:09:02,915 --> 00:09:09,260
Okay, so I'm going to go back to our
original dataset, mock.class.data.

137
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,185
And then I'm going to follow the
instructions and

138
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:19,270
go to Extras, actually extras is not an
option on the Console window right now.

139
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,560
So this is actually a good example of
something you might encounter.

140
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,160
The way to deal with this is to click on
Packages and Data.

141
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,090
Click on Package Manager.

142
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,070
And then select Deducer Extras here.

143
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,492
And if you followed the instructions in

144
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:41,990
the installation video these should
already be selected.

145
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,570
Okay, now that we do that.

146
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,370
We see that extras pops up here in the
Console window.

147
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,340
So that'll allow us to select Data
Summary.

148
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,060
And then it'll allow us to select our
Dataset.

149
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,339
I'll hit Run.

150
00:09:55,339 --> 00:10:01,386
Now, if I spread this out a little bit, it
makes a little more sense.

151
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:03,996
And we can see that it gives us summary
information for

152
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:06,590
all the variables in our Dataset.

153
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:10,330
Now, to specifically answer the question
about how many missing values we have in

154
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,278
the variable Carter.

155
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,028
I go to, affine carter, I go to that, and
then I look at NA's, or

156
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:17,910
number of missings, in other words.

157
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:23,382
And I see that we have 12 missing values
in the variable carter.

158
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:30,180
The next question asks us to create a
histogram.

159
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,025
In dark blue for the variable, coffee.

160
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:39,050
And so what I'm going to do is go to Plots
and select Plot B uilder.

161
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,534
I'm going to click on Histogram and

162
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:46,430
actually drag it down to this space right
here.

163
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,582
I'm going to let go and

164
00:10:47,582 --> 00:10:53,171
then again I'm going to click on coffee
and drag it to the Variable window.

165
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:58,100
And once you drag the variable coffee over
variable will turn green.

166
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,333
I'll hit OK.

167
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:05,720
And this is going to plot a histogram of
coffee drinking.

168
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,204
Now, I want this histogram to be in blue,
and

169
00:11:08,204 --> 00:11:13,190
this template that it offered me didn't
offer me that choice.

170
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,926
So what I'm going to do is Delete this for
now, and

171
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:19,530
then select the Geometric Elements tab.

172
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,730
And then I'm going to select histogram
from here.

173
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,770
Now this is going to offer me a few more
options as you can see.

174
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,635
I'm going to drag coffee over again under
X.

175
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:34,765
This represents the variable you want
across the X axis you'll see the X

176
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:37,640
turn green once I did that.

177
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:43,070
And then, this option allows me to set the
Fill and the Color.

178
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,510
Color just means the color of the line.

179
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:51,560
So I'm going to click on Color, and then
select some kind of blue, hit OK.

180
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,195
And I'll do the same thing for Color.

181
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:55,370
And then I'll hit OK.

182
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:00,050
And then you'll see that it now plots me a
histogram of coffee drinking, in blue.

183
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,632
Moving on, now we want to create a scatter
plot of hours of exercise, or

184
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:10,670
in other words a variable exercise, versus
hours of homework.

185
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,950
One reason you might want to do this,

186
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,731
is to see what the distribution is for
people.

187
00:12:17,731 --> 00:12:22,519
Or rather with what happens to the amount
of time you spend exercising as

188
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:28,170
the amount of time you spend on homework
increases, right.

189
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,835
So you can imagine that if that was your
question,

190
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:35,507
this might be a first step into looking at
that relationship.

191
00:12:35,507 --> 00:12:38,952
So what I'm going to do is first let me
exit out of this plot builder,

192
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:43,653
I'm going to go to Plot Builder again,
Plots, Plot Builder.

193
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:47,560
And then from templates I'm going to
select Scatter Smooth.

194
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,662
So again what I'm going to do is, simply
click here and

195
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:53,635
drag this down into this space.

196
00:12:53,635 --> 00:12:57,380
Okay, and I have two options here.

197
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,955
I can drag a variable onto the x amount of
the y, and as you've probably guessed,

198
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:05,570
that means that I can specify what
variables I want on what axis.

199
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,047
But this question, it doesn't really
matter.

200
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:14,505
I'm just going to move exercise to the x
axis, and homework to the y axis.

201
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:19,190
The questions specifies that they want a
smoothed curve.

202
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,975
So I'm just going to leave that there.

203
00:13:20,975 --> 00:13:24,620
And I'm going to hit OK, great.

204
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,760
And so now we see this relationship.

205
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,934
So as you can see here the trend line is
pretty flat.

206
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:33,828
I wouldn't say there's a really dramatic
trend at all.

207
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:36,032
There might be a slight trend or

208
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:42,492
small correlation between having a lot of
homework and exercising less.

209
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:47,140
But again, that would be a very weak
effect here.

210
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,320
And I don't notice any egregious outliers,
as well.

211
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,512
So, these are all things you sort of want
to keep in mind as you look at

212
00:13:54,512 --> 00:13:56,850
these different plots.

213
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,074
Moving on to question seven,

214
00:13:58,074 --> 00:14:02,310
question seven is asking us to create a
histogram for the variable milk.

215
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,180
And then it gives us a little more
information, so

216
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,270
let's, let's just do that first.

217
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,145
So I'm going to go to Plots and Plot
Builder again.

218
00:14:10,145 --> 00:14:16,194
Drag down histogram, drag over milk,
whoops.

219
00:14:16,194 --> 00:14:17,566
Hit OK.

220
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:21,096
And now I see this histogram for milk.

221
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:22,700
I'm going to continue the questions now.

222
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,986
So, the question says, you notice that's
there's one person who

223
00:14:25,986 --> 00:14:32,095
indicated [COUGH] 50 which seems like an
outlier compared to the rest of your data.

224
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:36,225
After going back to the data collection
forms you verify in fact that 50

225
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:41,430
was miscoded and that the true value
should have been five.

226
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,760
This happens all the time.

227
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:49,040
You decide to fix this problem, by
creating a new variable called milk fixed.

228
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,226
And so presumably now, that's our
exercise.

229
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:58,750
To create a milk fixed variable that
removes or

230
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:05,010
recodes, this value 50 into the value 5.

231
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,850
The way I'm going to do this is first to
close the Plot Builder window.

232
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,024
Then I'm going to go to data, and select
recode variable.

233
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,866
And what I'm going to do is first drag
over Milk,

234
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:23,429
then I'm going to highlight Milk and
select Target.

235
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:27,300
And then it's going to ask me to recode
Milk into something, so

236
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,688
I want to recode this variable into Milk
Fixed, hit OK.

237
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:36,200
So now you see that this changed the
notations in this window.

238
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,920
Now it says milk into milkFixed, okay?

239
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,204
I'm going to select Define Recode, so this
is sort of the rule for

240
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:50,980
what I want, or how I want to recode this
original value variable of milk.

241
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:59,210
So what I can do here is simply type in
50, here, and 5 here, and select Add.

242
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:03,580
So, what this is saying is when milk
equals 50,

243
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:09,875
change that into five, for milk fixed,
okay.

244
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,630
Were going to hit OK, hit OK hm-mm.

245
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,326
So I'm going to scroll overall the way to
the right here and

246
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:21,359
you see that there's this new variable,
milk fixed.

247
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,500
And I'm going to scroll down, actually let
me go find that 50 first.

248
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,366
Where is that guy, row 30.

249
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:35,610
Okay, subject 30, or patient 30.

250
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:41,210
And I'm going to scroll over to milkFixed,
and I notice that when I go to

251
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:50,290
patient 30 and I look at this value that
it's indeed recoded as fixed.

252
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,070
Now, how do I know that nothing else has
changed?

253
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,558
Well, I don't really unless I run some
tests, but just as a sanity check let me

254
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:04,320
compare the first three values with the
first three values for each variable.

255
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,784
So the first three values for milk are 16,
0 and 4, first three variables for

256
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:14,800
milkFixed are the first three values I
should say, are 16, 0 and 4.

257
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,956
So, you know, you should always check.

258
00:17:16,956 --> 00:17:20,388
What the, you should always check the
composition of

259
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:24,890
your variables after making a change like
this.

260
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:31,730
But for this exercise, I'm pretty
satisfied that my recoding worked.

261
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,178
Moving on to question eight, question
eight is asking for

262
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,460
the mean, the standard deviation.

263
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,970
The median number of hours of sleep in
this Dataset.

264
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,818
So, that's a lot to ask for.

265
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:47,806
but, there's a really handy function in
this program that allows us to

266
00:17:47,806 --> 00:17:50,720
generate all three.

267
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,395
So, what I'm going to do is go to
Analysis, and

268
00:17:54,395 --> 00:18:00,020
then Descriptive, and then drag over
Sleep.

269
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,025
going to hit Continue.

270
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:08,420
And then I can select what I want, what
sort of descriptive variables I want.

271
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,090
I'm going to select Median and also drag
that over.

272
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:17,412
So now if I hit Run, I'm going to get the
mean, the standard deviation,

273
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:24,790
the number of valid records for that
variable and the median for sleep.

274
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:29,894
And indeed, in the Console window we see
that the output is 6.97 for

275
00:18:29,894 --> 00:18:37,560
mean sleep standard deviation of 0.7 and
the median is seven hours.

276
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,028
The next question is asking us to perform

277
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:49,040
a stratified analysis of mean outlook on
life by alcohol consumption.

278
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,176
Or set a different way, what's the mean
score for outlook on life for

279
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:54,758
each amount of alcohol consumed.

280
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:59,854
The way I'm going to do this is to go to
Analysis and then Descriptives.

281
00:18:59,854 --> 00:19:02,854
And then I'm going to move sleep back over
here,

282
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:07,060
because we're not interested in that
anymore.

283
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,790
And instead select Optimism.

284
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,308
And what I'm going to stratify by, is
alcohol.

285
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:17,654
Because what we want to see is the sort of
mean of optimism, or different val,

286
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:25,070
different descriptive values for optimism
by level of alcohol intake.

287
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,220
So I'm going to drag alcohol to the
Stratify By window, click Continue.

288
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,723
And I'm pretty happy with this, I don't
really need to see standard deviation.

289
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:37,363
But mean and median are good things to
look at, so

290
00:19:37,363 --> 00:19:42,410
I'm going to keep those and hit Run, okay.

291
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:47,350
Now, I'm going to widen this window a
little bit, and I see that for

292
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:54,815
each value of alcohol, the program
calculated the mean optimism.

293
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:58,404
The number of optimism records that had,

294
00:19:58,404 --> 00:20:05,520
that alcohol value as well as the median
optimism for that value.

295
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,348
And so, to get back to the question the
questions specifically asks the mean

296
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:13,520
score for those who indicated that they
had five drinks.

297
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:22,350
So I'm going to go to alcohol 5, mean
optimism is 74.5.

298
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:27,620
The next question asks us, how many people
consider themselves street smart?

299
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,810
Now, just faced with that question, you
might not know where to begin.

300
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,395
But, to phrase that a different way,
that's like saying,

301
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:38,762
what's the frequency of people who
consider themselves street smart.

302
00:20:38,762 --> 00:20:41,130
And that sounds a little more statistical.

303
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,595
Basically that gives you a hint that we
want to go to Analysis and

304
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:47,401
select Frequencies, okay?

305
00:20:47,401 --> 00:20:52,950
Then I'm going to move over the
IsBookSmart variable, and hit OK.

306
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,554
So, this gives me, an output that
generates frequencies for

307
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:59,813
the different values of IsBookSmart.

308
00:20:59,813 --> 00:21:07,665
Now, IsBookSmart is binary, it's either
YesBookSmart or NoBookSmart.

309
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:08,491
In the case of no,

310
00:21:08,491 --> 00:21:12,992
it means that you're street smart, that's
how the question was phrased.

311
00:21:12,992 --> 00:21:17,240
And so we see that there are nine people
who consider themselves street smart in

312
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,600
this dataset.

313
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,680
And 40 people who consider themselves
booksmart in this dataset.

314
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,560
Just by convention, I should mention, that
0 means no, and 1 means yes.

315
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:36,790
That is sort of coding convention.

316
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,680
The next question asks us to create a box
Plot for the variable fruit veg.

317
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,550
And, it asks us what the black dot in the
figure represents.

318
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,294
Well, first, we need to generate the
figure.

319
00:21:47,294 --> 00:21:49,846
So that's what I'm going to do, as you
probably guessed,

320
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:54,158
the way I'm going to do that is by going
to Plots > Plot Builder.

321
00:21:54,158 --> 00:22:00,595
And then selecting, simple box plot, and
dragging that down here.

322
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:06,770
And then selecting the variable, fruitveg,
right here.

323
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,728
And dragging that into the variable box,
clicking OK, and, here we go.

324
00:22:11,728 --> 00:22:16,115
Let me expand this a little bit.

325
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:19,295
So here's the box plot.

326
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:21,614
It looks a little trivial by itself.

327
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:26,461
It's not giving me too much information,
but the black dot.

328
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:27,928
So what does the black dot represent?

329
00:22:27,928 --> 00:22:32,968
It's defined usually in box plots as data
points that are either more than one and

330
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:36,936
a half times the interquartile range.

331
00:22:36,936 --> 00:22:43,100
The interquartile range is basically the
length of the rectangle.

332
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,330
The interquartile range represents
everything from

333
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:53,140
the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile
of the data.

334
00:22:53,140 --> 00:23:01,390
So if your 1.5 times that range, then
you're usually considered an outlier.

335
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:07,364
So, I'd say that that black dot represents
an outlier in our dataset.

336
00:23:07,364 --> 00:23:11,828
The last question in the exercise asks us
to reexamine the relationship of

337
00:23:11,828 --> 00:23:17,760
mean outlook on life by alcohol
consumption, using a group box plot.

338
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,684
So, I'm going to stay in the Plot Builder
window,

339
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:26,620
the way I'm going to do that is to select
Group Box plot and drag that down.

340
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,020
Under Variable, I'm going to move
Optimism, and

341
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,860
then under Group, I'm going to move
alcohol.

342
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,882
And the reason I'm going to do that is
because I want to look at the values for

343
00:23:39,882 --> 00:23:44,840
optimism for each different alcohol group.

344
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,304
All right, so then I hit OK,

345
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:54,978
first I might need to Delete the simple
box plot from before.

346
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:59,906
And then I see this box plot, that is
stratified by

347
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:07,170
all the different values for alcohol in
the dataset.

348
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:12,370
And if there was some sort of trend let's
say between optimism and alcohol.

349
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,317
If you drank more, maybe you were more or

350
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:17,390
less optimistic about your outlook on
life.

351
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,370
You would see this box plot, this visual
will show you that.

352
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:26,506
But in this figure we don't really see any
sort of trend like that.

353
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:30,536
But it's just a nice way, it's another way
of visualizing that text heavy data,

354
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:33,488
that we were looking at before.

355
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:37,480
So that concludes the exercise.

356
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,786
One last note I want to make is that there
are a lot of different ways you

357
00:24:40,786 --> 00:24:43,918
could have approached these problems.

358
00:24:43,918 --> 00:24:47,398
And you might have found, let's say the
mean or the median for a variable,

359
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:53,075
in a different way than I showed in this
video, or that I wrote in the solutions.

360
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,830
And that's absolutely fine.

361
00:24:54,830 --> 00:25:00,220
There are many, many different ways of
arriving at the answer.

362
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,790
This is just one example, or one
suggestion, of how to do that.

363
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,870
And that concludes this

364
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:13,829
first R video module.
