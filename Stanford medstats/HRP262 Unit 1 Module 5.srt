1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,440
In this next module I'm just going to give
you some examples of Kaplan-Meier curves

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,410
from the literature to get some practice
on reading Kaplan-Meier curves.

3
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,190
So, the first example is just a fun
example that comes out of

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,980
the British Medical Journal's Christmas
edition and for

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,360
those of you who aren't familiar with it,

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,210
this is a satirical addition that they put
out, it's just for fun.

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,340
And somebody submitted a paper on the
survival analysis of chocolates.

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,690
So again, just a fun example here.

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,990
The study design, this was a study they
actually did carry out,

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,870
was that they actually placed two types of
chocolate boxes, Quality Street and

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,100
Roses chocolates and on different wards in
the same hospital.

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,170
They used eight boxes in the study,
containing a total of 258 chocolates.

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,170
Now, in fact, the others have in no way
accounted for

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,670
the fact that chocolates within the same
box might some how be correlated.

15
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,760
We are going to forgive them that, again,
because this is just a fun little example.

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,900
So, each chocolate is an observation and
they're following the chocolates.

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,980
There's somebody kind of hiding in the
back watching the chocolates being eaten.

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,620
They're following the chocolates.

19
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,260
Each chocolate until it was eaten, each of
these 258 chocolates.

20
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,040
The main outcome measure was the median
survival time of a chocolate.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,470
How, how quickly do chocolates on a
hospital ward get eaten?

22
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,420
And they also looked at things like,

23
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,800
did the nurses versus the doctors eat more
of the chocolates and so on.

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,620
Anyway it's just a fun example and

25
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,060
they generated a nice Kaplan-Meier curve
for the data.

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,535
Again, we started with 258 chocolates in
eight different boxes.

27
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:45,370
There were two types of chocolates, the
Quality Street which is from Nestle, and

28
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,610
Roses which is from Cadbury.

29
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,280
You know, it looks like that Cadbury box
is a little prettier.

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,400
Perhaps that's why that, the Roses, the
Cadbury chocolates,

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,850
got eaten a little bit faster.

32
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,690
And you can see that that type of
chocolate is pictured in blue,

33
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,480
the bottom curve on this Kaplan-Meier
curve.

34
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,530
So, they were eaten more rapidly.

35
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,430
And what's so nice about this Kaplan-Meier
curve is that they nicely placed

36
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,370
the number of chocolates who were still,
that were still at risk of being eaten.

37
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,190
On the bottom here, it's always good to
put your sample sizes on the bottom like

38
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,610
this, so that you know, especially when
you get to the end of a Kaplan-Meier

39
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,770
curve, that there's very few observations,
people, chocolates left at risk,

40
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,080
and to be a little careful at the end of
that Kaplan-Meier curve.

41
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,600
The time here is given in minutes, so

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,200
minutes from the box being put on the
ward.

43
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,330
Obviously we started with 100% chocolates
and we drop off from there.

44
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,860
Again, the Cadbury Roses, chocolate seemed
to be the prefer,

45
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,709
preference because they were eaten at a
faster rate.

46
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,100
Couple of other things we can pick up off
of a Kaplan-Meier curve,.

47
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,890
What if we wanted to know, what is the
median survival time for

48
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,760
a chocolate on a hospital ward?

49
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,870
So, what we can do is look for the 50%
line.

50
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,570
This is where we have 50% survival.

51
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,456
We are going to just kind of draw over and
find at

52
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:06,575
what point was there chocolates survival
probability in each of the two groups.

53
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:09,300
And in fact, the fifth, the median
survival time is

54
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,360
shorter in the Roses chocolates and we'd
have to keep going over and

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,540
the median survival time is longer for the
Quality Street chocolates.

56
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,980
So, you know, you're just guessing here,
but

57
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,940
it looks like somewhere around, close to
100 maybe, were the Roses,

58
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,690
as the median survival time in minutes for
the Roses chocolates versus for

59
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,810
Quality Street, it appears to be somewhere
around 125 minutes.

60
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,730
And this was a statistically significant
difference with a log rate test.

61
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,070
Anyway, that's just a fun example.

62
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,890
Another example that's a little bit more
serious but

63
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,150
another one of my favorite, examples of
Kaplan-Meier curve.

64
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,100
This is also from the British Medical
Journal.

65
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,910
A little bit of an older study, but makes
a really important point.

66
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,270
So, what the researchers here did was they
looked at a bunch of grants that

67
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,270
were funded.

68
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,500
And, so that's what we're starting with at
baseline,

69
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,740
this is the time at which the grants were
funded.

70
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,704
And there's a, little less than 200 grants
here, or

71
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,553
more, but more than 200 grants here that
were funded.

72
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:11,620
And they follow them until publication.

73
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,806
So, the outcome is something positive,
it's the time-to-publication.

74
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:18,910
So, you actually want to have a curve
here, unlike in,

75
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,410
when we have survival curves.

76
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,030
For this curve, you want to be on the
curve that's dropping steeply,

77
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,090
because that means you got published
quickly, so

78
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,515
time to first publication from a major
grant.

79
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:31,330
And what they were interested in is that
they thought that

80
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,670
grants that ended up to going on to have a
study, that had a significant or

81
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:41,200
positive finding, might be more likely to
be published rapidly than a, a study that,

82
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,460
that came out with a no result, didn't
find what it was hoping to find.

83
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,540
This gets at the concept of publication
bias,

84
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,460
which is a major concern in literature.

85
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,290
And, indeed, that's exactly what they
found.

86
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,550
So, the black line here.

87
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,190
The dark black rine, line represents the
studies in which, sort of, the main thing

88
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,680
that they were looking at for this study,
was found to be significant.

89
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,120
They actually, kind of, found what they
were looking for.

90
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,670
They got a significant result.

91
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,450
You can see that that line drops rather
rapidly.

92
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,270
We can look at the median time to
publication if you

93
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,750
have a significant result.

94
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,400
The median time to publication from
funding, if you had a significant result,

95
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,500
was about five years.

96
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,880
And a lot of these studies are trials and

97
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,400
things, they take time to, to actually
carry out the study.

98
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,780
As expected, null results, that is where
you did not find a significant result.

99
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,140
That's the gray line here.

100
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,270
Had a much longer time until publication.

101
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,350
The median time for that group was closer
to eight years, actually.

102
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,540
So, hugely different.

103
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,150
Again, this is gets a publication bias
because sometimes a null result is

104
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,480
just important, is often just important as
a positive result.

105
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,134
So, the fact that these pub, that these
publications are being held out of

106
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:52,070
the literature for so long creates a bias.

107
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,840
What was also really interesting, which I
love about this study,

108
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,380
was they looked at another group, which is
actually,

109
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,330
really, kind of ended up being a small
group, but pretty interesting here.

110
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,728
So this top line, what is that?

111
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:06,000
That represents non-significant trends,
so,

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,220
if the main hypothesis of your study, you
end up with,

113
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,200
at the end of the day, what we call sort
of a non-significant trend,

114
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,690
it probably means something like P is less
than 0.1 but greater than 0.05.

115
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,170
Didn't reach conventional statistical
significance, but

116
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,550
there's a hint of something.

117
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,610
Maybe the power was too low.

118
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,750
It turned out that that took the longest
to get published,

119
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,410
which I find really interesting.

120
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,270
So, something a little bit about human
nature, we don't like things that are in

121
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,470
a gray area, so those researchers had the
hardest time getting those published,

122
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,050
which is interesting.

123
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,310
So, that's just another example of a
Kaplan-Meier curve.

124
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,620
Just one more set of examples here,

125
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,190
because I want to make one additional
point.

126
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,240
One place you'll see a lot of Kaplan-Meier
curves these days,

127
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,627
is everybody wants to do gene signatures
and

128
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:55,040
bio-marker signatures for prognosis for
different diseases.

129
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,300
So, very commonly we see in the
literature,

130
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,390
people trying to come up with gene
signatures that can predict, for example,

131
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,990
what cancer patients are most likely to go
on to, have a good result, and which ones

132
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,090
are most likely to, to go on to have a bad
result, and that can guide treatment.

133
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,930
So you're going to, somebody who looks
pretty low risk for

134
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,020
recurrence, you might treat them less
aggressively.

135
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,900
Whereas, somebody who looks very high risk
for

136
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,540
recurrence, you might choose to teat them,
treat them more aggressively.

137
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,180
Just a little caution on these is that
there's been a lot of

138
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,360
things published on gene signatures for

139
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,100
cancer prognosis in the literature that
really haven't held up.

140
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,300
That haven't been able to be replicated
later on.

141
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,000
And you can imagine that there's probably
good reason for that, which is that when

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,820
we do things like gene signatures we're
looking at a huge, huge number of markers.

143
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,240
You might be looking at 5,000, 10,000,
20,000 genes.

144
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,430
There's a huge chance of Type one error
here.

145
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,480
And a huge risk of over fitting.

146
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,160
So, a lot of these genes signatures that
look good for a particular group

147
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,352
then fall down when later we try to
validate them in an independent sample.

148
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:02,720
Now, I'll just show you some examples of
that now.

149
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,630
Sometimes these curves look so beautiful
that they can be very seductive but

150
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,180
be careful to make sure that things have
been properly validated.

151
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,524
So, just as an example,

152
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:15,830
this was a study published in the New
England Journal of Medicine in 2007.

153
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,880
They found a five gene signature, so some
particular combination of low and

154
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,610
high expression in five genes that seemed
to predict survival in non- smell,

155
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,270
small cell lung cancer.

156
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,210
And, we don't have to go into all the
details.

157
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,670
I don't really want to go into all details
of this particular study.

158
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,550
You can see that there is a whole bunch of
Kaplan-Meier curves here.

159
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,262
But just the broader point is, if you look
at all these

160
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:42,630
different Kaplan-Meier curves, it does
look like they have pretty good

161
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:47,410
separation between low risk cancer
patients, who are more likely to survive,

162
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,620
and high risk patients who are more likely
to die and to die more quickly.

163
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,580
So, if you look across the Kaplan-Meier
Curves,

164
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,150
they are representing somewhat different
things, so

165
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,440
some of them are showing relapse free
survival versus overall survival,

166
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,760
one is the outcome of death, one is the
outcome of recurrence and

167
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,990
they're showing it in some slightly
different groups.

168
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:09,070
But in all the cases, they seem to have
fairly good separation and even g is

169
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,080
actually looking at an independent cord
and even though the curves are a little

170
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,700
bit closer together, they still seem to
have pretty good separation.

171
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,370
All significant long range tests, the last
one,

172
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,460
the log rank test only came up to be 0,.06
but the rest.

173
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,330
You can see the log-rank tests were all
highly statistically significant.

174
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:31,080
So, looks like there, you know, maybe have
found a good gene signature.

175
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,170
However, others then tried to replicate to
independently validate this

176
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:40,130
particular signature in a, an entirely new
cohort of patients, and

177
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,600
they didn't find such good separation.

178
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,560
I'm not exactly sure what's going on here,
because they're, turns out the,

179
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,470
the not very many of the patients are
classifying as low risk, so

180
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,410
the low risk group is very small here.

181
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,090
But in any case,

182
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,410
it doesn't seem to separate well at all,
so it makes some question about how

183
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,760
good of a prognostic marker that five gene
signature really was.

184
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,030
And you see this in a lot of examples, so
just one more example,

185
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,590
this is another three gene signature for a
non smell,

186
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,936
small cell lung cancer that was in the
Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2007.

187
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:16,390
Again, it looked like had really, pretty
good separation of curves.

188
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,450
A lot of the genes had been identified in
other studies.

189
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,110
So, there was some good repeatability
here.

190
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,710
This is showing you stage.

191
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,780
Everybody is in panel B, it shows
everybody.

192
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:32,050
And then it's broken down into stage one
and stage two patients for lung cancer.

193
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,190
But in any case, again, we've got these
beautiful Kaplan-Meier curves.

194
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,860
Highly significant P values for

195
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,900
the log rank test, looks to be pretty good
separation.

196
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,100
However, when another, that same group had
then tried to validate this in a totally

197
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,690
new sample of lung cancer patients, the
left panel shows stage one patients and

198
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:56,165
the right panel shows stage two patients,
there wasn't such good separation and

199
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:59,750
the log rank test is totally null on the
left panel.

200
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,310
And null on the right panel it,

201
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,060
even though there looks to be a tiny bit
of separation there.

202
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,500
So, the point being that, even though
these Kaplan–Meier curves can often look

203
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,590
beautiful when applied to the data that
was used to fit the model,

204
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:16,700
many times those data don't hold up in
future samples.

205
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,250
And there's a great study in the
literature that's worth me pointing out.

206
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,280
Where some researchers try to get at this
point,

207
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,670
they actually simulated some data to, to
make this point.

208
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,070
So, what they did is they had a data set
of 129 cancer patients and

209
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,950
they knew their time to death for those
patients.

210
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,190
What they then did was though,

211
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,390
to create some mock gene expression data
for 5000 genes.

212
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,940
So they just kind of generated 5000 random
variables off of a random normal

213
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,650
number generator for the 129 patients,
pretending that these were some genes.

214
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,880
Obviously, these variables are completely
random and

215
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,870
have no relationship whatsoever to
survival.

216
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,480
They're just noise.

217
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,130
What they then did was though, because we
have 5,000 variables.

218
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,930
You can imagine here that the type one
error rate is huge.

219
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,680
They are going to find some things that
appear to significantly predict

220
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,540
survival in this group even when they
don't and that's exactly what they showed.

221
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,700
They fit prognostic models for the real
survival data.

222
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,060
They actually know the time to death for

223
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,360
these people using these totally made up
variables.

224
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,940
They get it properly, so

225
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,690
they randomly divide 129 patients into
training sets and test sets.

226
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,720
They only developed the model on the
training sets and then they

227
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,010
properly tested the model on the test sets
who had not been used to fit the model.

228
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,944
They generated Kaplan-Meier curves on the
training data.

229
00:12:35,944 --> 00:12:38,794
Those are obviously going to be over fit,
they're going to be,

230
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:41,816
because these are what we call
re-substitution statistic.

231
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:45,656
So this is, again, measuring performance
on the same data that were used to

232
00:12:45,656 --> 00:12:49,496
fit the model, but they then properly
tested the models also on the tests and

233
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:53,278
then they repeated the simulation a number
of times just to make a point.

234
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:54,540
So here is their results.

235
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,200
They're fun to look at.

236
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,860
So what you see on the left-hand column
here is the Kaplan-Meier curves

237
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,460
from the Training sets and the log rank
tests that go with them.

238
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,730
Again, based on these 5,000 mock genes.

239
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,140
You can see great separation.

240
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,100
So, they were able to find a set of genes
out of these 5,000 that really predicted,

241
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,240
for each one of these training set the,
who was going to survive for

242
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,130
a long versus a short amount of time, low
risk versus high risk patients.

243
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,160
Huge separation, beautiful Kaplan-Meier
curves, that looks great, and

244
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,100
you can imagine that being published in
the literature,

245
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,670
an everybody being seduced by that.

246
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,830
however, when they then took that same
gene signature that they got out of

247
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,120
the training set and applied it to the
validation set,

248
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,590
the, the data that were held out and not
used to fit the model.

249
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,975
They got no separation at all, the,

250
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:44,000
the difference from the curves, as we'd
expect, completely disappears, so

251
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,640
now all the Kaplan-Meier curves are
completely overlapping.

252
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,580
The log rank tests are all non
significant.

253
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,740
This is to illustrate that point where
you're not expecting these gene,

254
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,880
these genes shouldn't predict survival
because they're totally made up data,

255
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,850
they have nothing to do with survival.

256
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,400
And then that's illustrated here.

257
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,450
But again, it's easy to get seduced by
these beautiful Kaplan-Meier curves on

258
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,930
the left hand side.

259
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,090
And again, they did this, the simulation
ten times, so

260
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,514
this is just showing you the results for
all ten simulations.

261
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,542
You see the same thing, great separation
on the training set,

262
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:17,786
totally overoptimistic performance values
when applied, when you're looking

263
00:14:17,786 --> 00:14:22,878
at the training data that were used to fit
the model, when you apply that model to

264
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:28,426
the validation set, there's absolutely
nothing there, no predictive power [SOUND]
