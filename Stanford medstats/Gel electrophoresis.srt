00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,090
Hello students.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,600
We're going to learn about gel
electrophoresis of biological molecules.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,890
What is gel electrophoresis?

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,610
It's the application of an electric field
across a slab made from a gel matrix.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,420
The gel is made from a polymer that
solidifies at room temperature.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,400
[BLANK_AUDIO]

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,150
The polymer is agarose, which is extracted
from seaweed.

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,450
Or polyacrylamide.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,540
Here is a scanning electron micrograph of
agarose.

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,260
And you can see that this type of

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,380
gel contains all kinds of barriers and
pores, and it's.

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,790
Used to separate DNA molecules.

13
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:54,380
So a long DNA molecule traveling through
this gel would bump into an obstruction,

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,260
for example.

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,160
And then the front end might turn into a
blob.

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,480
And then with the continued application.

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,466
Of the electric field,

18
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:05,771
[BLANK_AUDIO]

19
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:09,110
The DNA could begin sneaking through the
gel again.

20
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:18,460
So as a result the DNA molecule would move
in a discontinuous way through the gel.

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,800
Being retarded by the sitting properties
of the agorose and

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,880
the agorose would separate the DNA on the
bases of size.

23
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,610
Now here is a slab of agorose the slab of

24
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,880
agorose contains at the top some wells
that allow you.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,500
To load the DNA samples.

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,430
So I'm going to load the DNA samples
inside the top of the agorose.

27
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,120
And then I'm going to hook the gel up to
an electric field,

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,770
and because the DNA is generally
negatively charged.

29
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,274
I'm going to hook up the electrodes so
that the positive charge is on the bottom.

30
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:09,910
And as a result the DNA will migrate down
the gel and separate according to size.

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,810
Now, what about separating biological
molecules?

32
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,775
You can separate, either RNA, DNA, or a
protein.

33
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:26,360
[COUGH]
The DNA,

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,536
as we mentioned before, is generally
negatively charged along, because it's.

35
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,040
Got fossH groups and it's phosphoid aster
backbone.

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,240
But DNA is very long so we cut it with a
restriction enzyme.

37
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,210
Okay then we have different sized DNA
molecules the restriction enzymes cut at

38
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,000
very specific sequences so

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,380
the DNA molecules end up cut into very
characteristic set of sizes.

40
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:00,010
Then we separate the DNA molecules
according to size by gel electrophoresis.

41
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:09,840
We block the DNA molecules on to solid
support, say natural cellulose.

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,480
And then, now that the DNA is on natural
cellulose.

43
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,106
We can denature the DNA, and

44
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:21,390
then hybridize the denatured DNA to a P32
labelled DNA probe.

45
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,460
The DNA probe will contain DNA sequences
that correspond.

46
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,370
To the gene we're particularly interested
in studying.

47
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,960
This clever procedure for

48
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,350
analyzing complex mixtures of DNA, is
called the Southern Blot.

49
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,560
Named after the inventor of the method, Ed
Southern.

50
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,690
What about RNA well RNA is single stranded
and

51
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,300
it often contains sequences that are self
complimentary.

52
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,190
And therefore can form secondary
structures.

53
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,120
The RNA needs to be denatured.

54
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,620
Prior to electrophoresis.

55
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,500
And in the denaturation process, we end up
with a extended piece of RNA.

56
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,590
Again, negatively charged because the RNA
has a phosphoidiester backbone.

57
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,600
And just as in the case of DNA, we can
separate.

58
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,886
The RNA molecules, like jello
electrophoresis.

59
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:25,310
We can blot the samples to match the
cellulose,

60
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,490
we do not need to denature, because the
RNA is already denatured.

61
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,440
And then we can hybridize the RNA to a P32
Ribo DNA probe to look for

62
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,000
the particular RNA species we are
interested in.

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,730
Now this is very similar to the analysis
of DNA.

64
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:48,640
So in an homage to Ed Southern, this
procedure is called a northern blot

65
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:55,650
[BLANK_AUDIO]

66
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,470
What about protein.

67
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:05,340
Well protein in addition to being able to
form blobs often contains.

68
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,535
Sulfhydryl bonds that hold the blobs into
place.

69
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:20,870
So, the proteins need to be reduced, in
order to break the disulfide bonds,

70
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:27,520
and denatured with sds sodium dodecyl
sulfate.

71
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,610
Is negatively charged.

72
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,500
And as a result, the protein ends up
coated with a negative charge,

73
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,710
just as in the case of RNA and DNA.

74
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,520
Just as before, one can do gel
electrophoresis of the different proteins.

75
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,290
One can blot the proteins over to
nitrocellulose.

76
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,939
And then in order to detect specific
proteins,.

77
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,520
What we would do would be, would be to
bind

78
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,200
the protein we're interested in to a
specific antibody.

79
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,470
And in a further homage to Ed Southern,
this is called a Western blot.

80
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,510
So Western blots analyze protein.

81
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,585
Northern blots analyze RA, and Southern
blots analyze DNA.

82
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,650
What about Southern?

83
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,520
Here's an example.

84
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,860
This is a southern blot using.

85
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,280
Probes derive from the fruit fly
Drosophila melanogaster.

86
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,160
These probes are for the UBX, Fitz, and
antennapedia genes.

87
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,090
These are homeotic genes that, basically
regulate the development.

88
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,660
Of the body pattern of the animal.

89
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:53,990
It turns out, that these genes are
strongly conserved in other animals.

90
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,770
Such as the beetle.

91
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,100
And even conserved in the chicken and the
mouse.

92
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:05,380
The beauty of Southern blot is that, the
hybridization of the DNA probe.

93
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,580
Doesn't have to be perfect so the dna
probe will hybernize word

94
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:14,280
the sequences that are similar but not
exactly complementary.

95
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:22,660
As a result you can find evidence for
these genes in all these species.

96
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,280
You can tell from the appearance of these
Southern blots.

97
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,370
That the hybridization to the chicken and
the mouse wasn't as strong.

98
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,530
Because there's more background here
between the bands.

99
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,950
And that means that the stringency,
stringency of the hybridization

100
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,340
was decreased, and to bring out to allow
the hybridization.

101
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,700
To the specific bands but as a result
there is a higher background.

102
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,430
What about northern blot.

103
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:58,640
This is a northern blot with three
isoforms of PPAR.

104
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,110
Delta, Alpha and gamma.

105
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,128
And it's analyzing RNA, from various
different tissues.

106
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:09,864
[BLANK_AUDIO]

107
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,688
Okay?

108
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:14,861
And what these investigators are
interested in is.

109
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:20,424
Is the, are there any species expressed at
different levels in different tissues,

110
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:22,549
and you can see indeed they are.

111
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:29,100
You can see for example that this isoform
is expressed in most tissues but

112
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,510
not so much in liver.

113
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:36,990
This isoform is strongly expressed in
heart kidney liver and BAT

114
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:45,420
and this isoform has it's own specific
expression in only two tissues.

115
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,650
Now we know that these.

116
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,810
Changes across the board are real because
there is

117
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,680
a control link containing a very abundant
form of RNA, 18S ribosomal RNA.

118
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:04,680
And this serves as a control that verifies
that the same amount of total RNA.

119
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,240
Was loaded into each lane.

120
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,030
What about western blot to analyze
proteins.

121
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,170
This is the analysis of the wiscott algers

122
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,000
syndrome protein in peripheral blood mono
nuclear cells.

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,100
And this is an experiment.

124
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:30,650
Which shows a healthy control and

125
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:37,749
a patient with Scott Aldrich syndrome and
patient number one here is being analyzed.

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,220
As a function of number of months after
gene therapy.

127
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,250
And the hope is that they could

128
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:53,010
express the protein in the, the cells of
the patient.

129
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,210
And you can see.

130
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,350
At seven, 12, 15, 22, and 29 months.

131
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,580
You can see that the level of the protein
at seven months was very low.

132
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,680
At 12 months, it went up even higher.

133
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,260
And then, at 15 months, it went up higher
yet.

134
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,740
There's a hint that maybe the expression
went down at 22 and 29 months.

135
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,719
But if you look at the control,

136
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:22,849
which is GAPDH, a housekeeping protein.

137
00:10:22,849 --> 00:10:28,033
You can see that, perhap, that it's, it
looks like the amount of protein

138
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:33,237
loaded in the lanes for 22 months and 20
29 months was somewhat less.

139
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:34,713
So that the decrease,

140
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:39,700
apparent decrease in expression at those
time points is probably not real.

141
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,960
So there you have it that's our survey of
jello electro freezes of

142
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,850
biological molecules.

143
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,350
Thank you.
