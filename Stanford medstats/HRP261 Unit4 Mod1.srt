1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,160
In this next module,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,950
I'm going to talk about one of the
assumptions of linear regression that

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,930
you really should test if you've got
continuous predictors in your model.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,390
I think it's often an ignored assumption,
so when you are reading papers,

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,560
you should look to see whether or not it
was tested, and

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,180
if you are doing your own data analysis,
it would be important to run this test.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,060
This assumption is something called linear
in the logit, and it's as simple as, just,

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,020
when we do a linear regression, remember,
what do you want to do, of course.

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,060
When you do a linear regression,

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,360
you want to do the plot and you want to
see if it actually looks like a line.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,550
This one looks like a line.

12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,410
Here's a scatter plot that doesn't look
like a line.

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,140
It actually looks like a quadratic.

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,290
So for linear regression, it's really
easy,

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,410
because we can just plot x against y and

16
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:53,120
we can see immediately if it looks like
the, the scatter plot roughly fits a line.

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,620
For logistic regression, we're still
fitting lines.

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,840
But it's harder to draw this graphic,
because the outcome,

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,280
remember, is this logit function.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,630
And there's no way to directly see the
logit function.

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,600
The best you can do is, I did some logit
plots, and

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,750
the first module for this week in how I
did that, in order to be able to do that,

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,020
I had to group people according to their
level of the predictor.

24
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,360
So I can group people who did the lowest
number amount of homework and, you know,

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,760
like the ten lowest, the ten people with
the lowest homework time, and

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,770
then the next then, and then the next ten.

27
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,040
So I have to somehow group people,

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,540
in order that I can calculate the
proportion who've had the binary outcome.

29
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,100
From that proportion I can then calculate
the logit.

30
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,420
If you do that, then you can make some
plots.

31
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,440
But of course, the plot's going to depend
slightly on how you bin people,

32
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,840
on how you group people.

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,720
So, I'm going to show you in a minute,
some examples of testing this,

34
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,050
a linear and the logit assumption.

35
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,100
And you'll see that I will usually run
several different graphs with several

36
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:00,020
different bin sizes, so that I can get a
sense of the data without you know,

37
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,070
being too arbitrary.

38
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,950
And we're looking for that what we're
testing is that if

39
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,450
you have a continuous predictor in
logistic regression,

40
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:12,140
what we're doing is we're fitting a line
that says that continuous predictor,

41
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,680
x, has a linear relationship roughly with
the logit of the outcome.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,960
So you actually want to make that plot as
best you can and

43
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,680
see if the relationship is really linear,
or if, maybe it's not.

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,705
If it's something else, if the
relationship looks you know,

45
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:31,435
quadratic, that means you're going to have
to model a quadratic variable for x,

46
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:33,400
you're going to put in x squared into the
model.

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,970
Or you might have to transform that
continuous variable into

48
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,520
a categorical variable.

49
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,720
It may not be simply fine to just put that
continuous predictor

50
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,640
directly into the model.

51
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,820
Notice if you have a binary or

52
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,590
a categorical predictor you do not have to
worry about this assumption.

53
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:56,190
Because, if you have a binary variable, a
binary predictor, you're only doing a 0/1.

54
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,490
You've got only two dots, therefore, and

55
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,640
any time you connect two dots it's
automatically a line.

56
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,310
If you have a categorical predictor,
you're going to be dummy coding it.

57
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,780
So you're going to have a series of 0/1s,
those are all going to make lines.

58
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,980
So this is only a worry when you have a
continuous predictor in

59
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,820
logistic regression.

60
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,810
I'm going to show you some real examples
with real data.

61
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,150
Various examples of where I've had to draw
linear in the logit plots.

62
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,980
This example was from a data set where the
outcome is heart disease.

63
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,670
The predictor that we're looking at here
called tobacco,

64
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,750
this is the number of cigarettes smoked
per day.

65
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,250
An I grouped the data set up into four
bins as well as ten bins just to give

66
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,390
us a, a sense of the relationship between,
the number of cigarettes per day and

67
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,705
the logit, of heart disease.

68
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:43,495
And again, I have to group people.

69
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:46,110
And what I'm graphing here is the, I'm
give,

70
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,610
graphing their mean cigarettes per day.

71
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,610
The mean cigarettes per day for

72
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,750
the group against the logit for that
group, the observed logit for that group.

73
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,900
What you can see here is that for this
particular variable,

74
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,126
the number of cigarettes per day, it does
not look linear in the logit.

75
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:07,206
The relationship between cigarettes per
day and our, the logit of

76
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:11,390
having heart disease appears curvolinear,
there appears to be a curved relationship.

77
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,030
In both of these graphics you can see it,

78
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,930
that there's sort of a curved relationship
here.

79
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,850
Why is that?

80
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,860
Well, think about the variable, cigarettes
per day.

81
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,930
You have a bunch of people who smoke zero
cigarettes per day.

82
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,300
And then you've got people increasing on,
on their cigarettes per day.

83
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,690
What you're seeing in this graphic here is
when you jump from being a non-smoker to

84
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,110
smoking, you know, some little amount per
day, there's a huge jump in your odds and

85
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,890
risk of getting heart disease.

86
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,170
There's a major steep jump, jump.

87
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,630
But then there's sort of diminishing
returns.

88
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,020
Once you're already a smoker, whether you
smoke a couple cigarettes per day, or, or

89
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,730
more, your risk does go up.

90
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,140
But it doesn't go up as steeply.

91
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,490
And then, when you go from kind of being a
moderate smoker to being a heavy smoker,

92
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,000
your risk also goes up, but it goes up
even less steeply.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,550
So the relationship is really curved
rather than linear.

94
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,550
How might you account for this?

95
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,510
Probably the best way is to think about
cigarette smoking as

96
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,260
a categorical variable.

97
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,700
You might want to model this as
non-smokers versus light to moderate

98
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,130
smokers versus heavy smokers, and that
might be the best way to actually model

99
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,210
this, is that this might be a case where
it makes sense to treat tobacco smoking

100
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,860
cigarettes per day as a categorical
variable rather than continuous.

101
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,640
So that's an example that violated the
linear in the logit assumption.

102
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,510
Here is an example where we're actually
meeting the linear in the logit

103
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,440
assumption pretty well.

104
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,790
This was some data I had on women
athletes, and

105
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,640
the outcome variable here is low bone
mineral density.

106
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,160
So low skeletal strength.

107
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,620
It turns out that women athletes sometimes
don't menstruate normally and

108
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,940
if you don't have normal menses that
actually can reduce your,

109
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,430
your skeletal strength, your, your bone
mineral, bone mineral density.

110
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,410
So that, this was a data set looking at
that.

111
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,020
Again, I did two linear in the logit
plots, so

112
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,250
I'm getting a sense depending on how I bin
things, how many people per group,

113
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,840
that I'm getting the right relationship.

114
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,160
So I grouped it to about 12 bins as well
as five bins.

115
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,080
And you can see that there's of course
more local noise when you have 12 bins,

116
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,200
but the pattern looks pretty similar in
both cases.

117
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,890
I would say that this is pretty close to
fitting a line.

118
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,215
It's not a perfect line, but

119
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:21,950
it looks like it actually is reasonably
linear in the logit.

120
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,720
In both cases, you can imagine kind of
drawing the line again.

121
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,120
With lots of points, there's going to be
some local variability.

122
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,230
But essentially that's well fit by a line.

123
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,920
So in this case, our predictor variable
here is number of menses,

124
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,800
the number of menstrual periods per year.

125
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,400
So, we're, you know, normally sort of
around 12.

126
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,810
A lot of women athletes are having many
less than that.

127
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,440
And it turns out that there's a linear
relationship here as the number of

128
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,600
menstrual periods goes up.

129
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,510
From 0 all the way up to a normal of 12,
the chances the, or

130
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,970
the odds of getting low, having low bone
density go down.

131
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,490
And it, it appears to be well modeled that
it's linear, so

132
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,600
I could put the number of menstrual cycles
per year in as the predictor variable and

133
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,900
get an odds ratio for every one unit
increase in menstrual and menses.

134
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,540
How does that decrease my odds of getting
low bone mineral density.

135
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,250
This one seems reasonably modeled as a
linear variable.
