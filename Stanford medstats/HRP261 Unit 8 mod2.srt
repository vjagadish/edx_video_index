[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,990
In this next module, I'm going to tell you
about ordinal logistic regression,

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,120
which you can use when you have an outcome
variable that has ordered categories.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,530
So if you have an outcome variable that
has more than two levels and there, the.

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,500
Categories are not ordered in any way.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,360
You have to use multinomial logistic
regression but

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,730
if your categories have some inherent
order to them then you

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,820
have option of running an ordinal logistic
regression.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,280
And that model is also called the
proportional odds model because one of

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,200
the assumptions that we are going to talk
about with this model is that, you have to

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,570
have what's called proportional odds and
generally what that means is.

12
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,370
That you have to kind of have equal jumps
in risk across the different categories in

13
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,370
order to be able to apply this model.

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,850
We'll talk about exactly what that means.

15
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,840
The example data that I'm going to be
using to

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,960
illustrate ordinalogistic regression are
the same data that I

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,600
use to illustrate multinomial logistic
regression.

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,930
It will allow us to kind of compare the
two models.

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,220
So, these were some data on 150 college
age distance runners.

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,050
The outcome of interest is menstrual
irregularity.

21
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,500
That's a categorical variable because
there are three categories of

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,060
menstrual status.

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,780
Those are, Eumenorrhiec, which is normal
periods.

24
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,660
Oligomenorrheic, which is kind of a mild
menstrual irregularity,

25
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,650
some irregular periods.

26
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,580
And amenorrheic, which is the most severe
because the women get very few to no

27
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,930
periods at all.

28
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,200
And there is an order in here.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,640
We're going from normal to, kind of,
medium severe, to the most severe.

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,480
So this is a ordinal variable, and we can
treat it as such.

31
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,770
The predictor of interest, here, was your
score on an eating disorder questionnaire.

32
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,030
We're abbreviating that as the E-D-I-A.

33
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,290
It ranges from zero to 21 points, and

34
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,030
it measures kind of how disorder the
restrictive your eating is?

35
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,150
So here are the outcomes, and we can, the
what we're going to be doing for

36
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,260
ordinal logistic regression is we have to
think of the outcomes in cumulative terms.

37
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,500
So let me just kind of set up that concept
now.

38
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,800
So here's our three categories,

39
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,760
here's the number of women in each of
those categories.

40
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,850
We can start by thinking about the most
severe category, in this case,

41
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,120
that's the amenorrheaic women.

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,508
This is the most severe menstrual
irregularity.

43
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:21,120
8.6% of my sample falls into that
category.

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,940
We could then think, cumulatively, about
being more inclusive.

45
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,240
So coming up with an outcome that,

46
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,210
is more inclusive than just the most
severe outcome.

47
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,600
We can include both the mild and the
severe together.

48
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,160
This is a cumulative outcome becomes I am

49
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,030
including the most severe along with sort
of the next category down.

50
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,710
And we could look at the risks of being in
either of those categories.

51
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,940
That's what we mean by accumulative
outcome.

52
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,780
If we had more than three levels, we could
then go down and include another more

53
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,270
inclusive category until we got you know,
to the reference group.

54
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,740
What we're going to do with this is we're
actually going to build what's called.

55
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,030
Called cumulative logits and that's what
the ordinal regression logistic regression

56
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,430
model relies on is cumulative logits.

57
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,040
So, what do I mean by cumulative logit?

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,300
We are going to be fitting logits, as we
do with logistic regression but

59
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,970
we are going to be logit for

60
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,440
the most extreme outcome and the logit for
the more inclusive outcome.

61
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,120
So, the logit for amenorrhea is going to
be the log odds.

62
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,950
Of having amenorrhea, compared with having
anything else.

63
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,960
So comparing the anenorrheaic women to
either oligomenorrheaic or normal.

64
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,240
The logit for any irregularity is going to
be the log odds of having

65
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,650
any menstrual irregularity, that is either
ammenorrhea or oligomenorrhea.

66
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,550
Compared with being normal.

67
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,590
And we're going to be modeling both of
these logits.

68
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,420
And this is, I've just restating in words
there, if you want to see it written out.

69
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,080
So here is what the logistic regression
model is actually going to look like,

70
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,950
we're going to literally model log odds of
amenorrhea.

71
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,840
The log odds of any irregularity.

72
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,310
And remember any irregularity includes
amenorrhea.

73
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,320
I'm going to start this to make this
really simple.

74
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,540
I'm going to start with the intercept only
model.

75
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,430
So there's no predictors in my model.

76
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,470
I'm just fitting a model that contains the
intercept.

77
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,490
In ordinal logistic regression I'm
actually going to be modeling

78
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,950
two intercepts.

79
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,700
One for the most severe category, and one
for the next inclusive category.

80
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,820
And if I had more than three categories,
I'd be.

81
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
Estimating even more intercepts than that.

82
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,160
So let me just show you how this works,

83
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,630
because I think it's easy to see with only
the intercept.

84
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,950
So, what is my model going to look like?

85
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,110
So first of all, what's the logit of
amenorrhea of my data set?

86
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,000
If I'm not putting any predictors in my
model,

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,150
the logit of amenorrhea just represents
the prevalence of amenorrhea in my sample.

88
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,150
So I had 8.6% prevalence of amenorrhea in
my sample, that's the probability.

89
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,090
I can turn that into an odds by dividing
8.6% by 1 minus that.

90
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,010
My odds is 0.094.

91
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,780
My log odds is therefore the natural log
of that.

92
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,150
So my log odds of amenorrhea in my data
set, not accounting for

93
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,640
anything is negative 2.3.

94
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,450
That's the logit of amenorrhea.

95
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,310
What's the logit of any menstrual
irregularity at all?

96
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,820
Well 33% of my sample has any menstrual
irregularity.

97
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,025
That includes a logit amenorrhea or
amenorrhea.

98
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:17,420
[INAUDIBLE] The odds, therefore, is one to
two.

99
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,610
The natural log of 1 to 2 is negative 0.7.

100
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,030
So, the logit of any irregularity is
negative 0.7.

101
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,490
If I don't put anything in my regression
model, that's all I'm fitting.

102
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,850
My fitted models will have two intercepts.

103
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,862
The intercepts will be negative 2.36 for
amenorrhea and negative 0.7 for

104
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:37,450
any menstrual irregularity.

105
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,030
So, that's the model if you didn't have
anything in it at all.

106
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,420
So, that will help you understand what the
intercept means.

107
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,950
Now, lets go ahead and

108
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,330
actually our predictor, this eating
disorder score into our model.

109
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,680
So, now, what is the ordinal logistic
regression model look like.

110
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,720
So, we are going to be fitting essentially
two models.

111
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,380
We're going to be looking at the logit of
amenorrhea and

112
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,050
the logit of any irregularity with
separate intercepts, but

113
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,500
then, what we're going to be doing is
estimating only a single beta.

114
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,970
So, two intercepts but only a single beta.

115
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,570
We're going to estimate one beta.

116
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,860
For eating disorder score.

117
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,520
Notice how this is different than
multinomial logistic regression.

118
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,260
In multinomial logistic regression, we fit
separate datas.

119
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,780
In ordinal logistic regression, we're
going to assume that the beta.

120
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,250
For, for going from having being normal,
to having any irregularity, and

121
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,620
a beta that represents going from have,
being non-amenorrheic to

122
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,150
being amenorrheic, that those betas are
the same, and

123
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,900
that's the assumption inherent in ordinal
logistic regression.

124
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,210
So we have [INAUDIBLE].

125
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,740
Different intercepts but we have a shared
beta.

126
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,620
So, before I actually fit this model I
have a continuous predictor variable so

127
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,600
I need to make sure that it's linear in
the logit in my outcome.

128
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,570
I actually essentially have two outcomes.

129
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,810
These cumulative outcomes so my logit plot
is going to have two lines on it.

130
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,210
If I had a, an ordinal variable that had
four levels to it my lu,

131
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,960
cumulative logit plot would have three
lines and so on.

132
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,760
So let me explain what's going on in this
logit plot.

133
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,210
It's a little more complicated than the
logit plots we've seen until now.

134
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,310
So I have two lines.

135
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,670
So my, my Y axis is logit again.

136
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:27,850
But the bottom line here represents the
logit of amenorrhea of outcome,

137
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,920
of the most severe outcome.

138
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,760
And is showing you, this is from my
observed data.

139
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,210
So I looked at women as they went up in
their EDIA score.

140
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,210
What did the logit amenorrhea do?

141
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,480
And that's what's plotted here.

142
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,590
It moves around a little bit, because
again these are the observed data.

143
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,680
But you can see the general pattern is
that,

144
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,860
as you go up in EDAI score, you, your
logit of amenorrhea goes up.

145
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,010
It's fairly linear.

146
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,430
It's not a perfect straight line, but I'd
say, as real data go, that's pretty good.

147
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,420
That looks pretty linear to me.

148
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,110
The second line represents the logit of

149
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,970
being either amenorrheic or
oligomenorrheic.

150
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,360
So that's that cumulative logit.

151
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,560
And you can see this, that there's a
similar pattern.

152
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,290
This is the intercept for having any
menstrual irregularities, so

153
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,640
this represents how many people have any
menstrual irregularity at

154
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,210
an edi score of zero.

155
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,500
And as you go up in EDAI score it
generally tends to go up again.

156
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,490
Now, again, there is a little bit of
variation because these are real data but

157
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,920
that looks like a pretty straight line to
me.

158
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,910
For my cumulative logit plot, I'm looking
for straight lines that it's linear in

159
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,500
the logit but I have an additional thing
that I need to check out on this graph.

160
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,690
So the assumption of the ordinalistic
progression model is that there

161
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,800
is a single beta.

162
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,180
In other words, that these lines have to
be parallel,

163
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,750
they have to have the same slope.

164
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,350
We are only estimating one beta for EDIA
so we have therefore

165
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:54,180
assumed that the slope of these two lines
has to be the same or very close.

166
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,570
So I'm looking at those two lines and

167
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,310
they, those look pretty darn parallel to
me.

168
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,410
So that would indicate to me that we have
indeed met what is

169
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,320
called the proportional odds assumption.

170
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,850
Again it's never going to be perfect with
real data, but

171
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,030
this is hm, about as good as you get.

172
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,910
That would mean that would,

173
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,199
would be fair to estimate one single beta
using all of the data.

174
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:18,530
I just written out all of that on to a
sliding tissue like to see it written out,

175
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,850
you could pause the video and read those
if, if it helps you.

176
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,140
So because I, I've seem to have met my
proportional odd assumption,

177
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,100
I went ahead and re add a single ordinal
logistic regression in my computer,

178
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,600
Here's the output that I get.

179
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,540
So my predictor is now this eating
disorder score.

180
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,220
I've run an ordinal logistic regression,
so

181
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,960
I'm going to get an intercept, two
intercepts.

182
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,270
And the intercept for amenorrhea and an
intercept for this more inclusive.

183
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,470
Category of any menstrual irregularity.

184
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,370
That corresponds to my logit plot because
I had two different intercepts on my logit

185
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,090
plot but I have only fit a single data for
EDIA.

186
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,880
That also corresponds to my logit plot
because it looks like those

187
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,510
lines are parallel and therefore that it
would.

188
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,240
Would be fair to just estimate the slope
of those parallel lines.

189
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,400
Notice that EDI score is indeed, does have
a statistically significant

190
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,320
relationship with both, amenoria and any
menstrual irregularity.

191
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,750
So that's what our logistic regression
model looks like.

192
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,150
We're going to have one beta but multiple
intercepts, from ordinal logistic.

193
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,030
We can translate that data into odds
ratios, so that,

194
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:27,150
I've done that here, so we can talk about
the odds ratio for a one unit

195
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:33,360
increase in this eating disorder score,
that odds ratio turn out to be about 1.13.

196
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,430
So, for every one unit increase in your
eating disorder score, you go up about 13%

197
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:43,390
in your odds of going from either
oligomenorrheic or

198
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,760
eumenorrheic to being amenorrhoeic.

199
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,210
And you're also going up about 13% in your
odds of going from

200
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,820
having a normal menses to having any
menstrual irregularities at all and

201
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,510
see how we're assuming that those two
jumps are the same.

202
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,550
We can also calculate the odds ratio for a
one standard deviation increase in eating,

203
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,890
eating disorders score, a standard
deviation's about six here, so the odds

204
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:10,220
ratio looks bigger, so we have a two,
about an odds ratio of about two there.

205
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,330
So again, what that says is that your
chances of going from sort of

206
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,960
normal menses to having any menst,

207
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,420
menstrual irregularity at all, if you go
up one standard deviation in eating.

208
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,360
Disorder score, then you are doubling your
odds of going, of having any menstrual

209
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,020
irregularity, you're also doubling your
odds of going from being in sort of

210
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,630
this smaller category of eumenorrheic or
oligonomerrheic not having the most.

211
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,280
Severe outcome, you're doubling your odds
therefore I'm

212
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,140
going from there to having the most severe
outcome.

213
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,730
And then again we have to assume that
those jumps are equal,

214
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,500
that's the proportional odds assumption.

215
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,800
I've written all of that out on a slide in
case you like to read it written out.

216
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,320
You can pause the video and read it there.

217
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,590
So here's our fitted logistic model.

218
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,110
So this is what our logistic model came
out to be.

219
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,610
Our intercept for amenorrhea was fitted at
negative 3.26.

220
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,960
For any irregularity the intercept's at
negative 1.38.

221
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,040
The beta's are the same, there's only a
single beta so

222
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,540
those lines are exactly parallel.

223
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,650
That beta is 0.1211, it's indeed positive
as we go up in the eating disorder score.

224
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:20,060
Our risk, or odds, of going to be in
either of these outcomes, goes up.

225
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,470
So that's a positive slope.

226
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,990
That's what we've, that's the ordinal
logistic regression model pictured,

227
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,460
that's what it actually looks like.

228
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,890
We can compare that because we did a logit
plot,

229
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,760
we can compare the fitted model to the
actual data.

230
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,280
And you can see that our fitted model
does, really, pretty well.

231
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,990
It really does capture the pattern in the
underlying data.

232
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,640
Of course, we're smoothing over the fact
that there's a little bit of noise at

233
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,490
the lower EDI score.

234
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,200
Scores, but in general I think that the
fitted model really does look

235
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,590
pretty close to the original data.

236
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,530
So, suggesting that it's a good model.

237
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,690
As with any logistic regression model, we
can then use the model to

238
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,470
get predictive probabilities based on a
woman's eating disorders score.

239
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,410
We're going to get two predictive
probabilities out of the model here.

240
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,430
We're going to get her probability of
being [UNKNOWN] in that

241
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,610
most severe category and

242
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,340
we're going to get the probability of
having any irregularity at all.

243
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,330
To get these predicative probabilities its
our usual equation fro

244
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,780
predictive probabilities.

245
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,450
Except for the amenorrhea equation we're
using the intercept for amenorrhea.

246
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,620
For the any irregularity equation we're
using the intercept for

247
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,570
any menstrual irregularity.

248
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,710
Let me just illustrate by actually
plugging some numbers in.

249
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,130
So imagine you had a woman whose eating
disorder score was equal to nine,

250
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,050
what would her predicted probabilities be
based on the model?

251
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,260
So we would plug in her value of nine, you
can punch that in a computer.

252
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:45,020
And yo will get out a value of about 10%
so a woman with an eating disorder.

253
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,620
Score of nine is predicted by our model
to,

254
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,130
have about a 10% chance of being
amenorrheic.

255
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,610
Now remember that about 8.6% of my sample
is actually amenorrheic, so

256
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,190
that says that she kind of has a higher
than average chance of being amenorrheic.

257
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,470
Cause she does have elevated EDI score.

258
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,490
We can get her chances of having any
menstrual irregularity again by.

259
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,934
Plugging into this equation.

260
00:14:08,934 --> 00:14:14,184
When I plug in there, I'm going to get
around 42% chance of

261
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:20,150
having any menstrual irregularity at all,
something like that.

262
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:25,942
So she has about 42% chance of having any
menstrual irregularity.

263
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:28,846
What if I wanted to actually get her
probability of,

264
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:32,230
specifically, having oligomenorrhea?

265
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:38,440
Well, I could just subtract the 42% minus
the 10%.

266
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,890
This would give me her chance of having,
of being oligomenorrheaic specifically,

267
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,826
that's going to come out to be about
32.3%.

268
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:48,700
So you can get that chance of being that

269
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,180
specific middle category by subtracting
here.

270
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,600
So I went ahead and had the computer
calculate.

271
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,150
For me predicting probabilities for a
bunch of different EDI score.So here's

272
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,610
the one for nine, which we just calculated
on the previous slide.

273
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,610
Some other ones in between.

274
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,240
The highest possible score is 21.

275
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,628
So if you had a score of 21.

276
00:15:05,628 --> 00:15:11,250
In about 33% chance of being amenorrheic,
43% chance of being oligomenorrheic,

277
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,743
about a 75% chance of being either one of
those and

278
00:15:14,743 --> 00:15:18,490
then a 24% chance of having normal, a
normal period.

279
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,210
so this comes about to be about maybe 76%
combined.

280
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,920
Now we already ran a multinomeial
progression where we also got out

281
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,660
similar predictive probability so I just
want to compare and show you that they.

282
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,120
Come out pretty close in this case.

283
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,920
So here is the results from the
multinomial regression that we ran in

284
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,350
a previous module.

285
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,480
So somebody who has a score of nine has
predicted probabilities again of

286
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,570
about 10%, 30%, 57, 58%, those are very
similar for

287
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,820
21, very similar to probabilities we saw
in the previous slide.

288
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,900
So in this case we get.

289
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,860
Pretty similar results whether we run the
ordinal logistic or

290
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,120
the multinomial relogistic in terms of the
predictive probabilities that tells us

291
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,660
that the ordinal model is probably good
here.

292
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:04,040
Because we haven't smooth over some kind
of important variations in the data,

293
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,060
it looks pretty similar whether we go into
the fine detail of every category or

294
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,070
we kind of estimate only one single beta.

295
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,540
So the advantage of estimating it with
ordinal edges to regression here is that

296
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,580
the way the multinomial regression worked
we actually had to

297
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,890
estimate two separate betas, one for
amenorrhea, one for oligomenorrhea.

298
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,510
By estimating two betas there was a
smaller sample size used to

299
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,590
estimate either of these betas, we only
had 13 women.

300
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,460
To estimate the beta for amenorrhea.

301
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,600
For example, 13 women who were
amenorrheic, 100 who were eumenorrheic.

302
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,650
That reduces our statistical power, means
our standard errors are going to

303
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:42,140
be a little bit bigger, our P values are
going to be a little bit bigger.

304
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:47,610
When we use all of the data, all 150 women
to estimate the, the beta

305
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,630
which was from the ordinal logistic
regression, there was only a single beta.

306
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,280
Then we have more statistical power.

307
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,200
So that means the standard error
associated with this single beta is

308
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,530
going to be smaller than the standard
errors that we got from the multinomial

309
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,580
regression, means our p values are
going to be smaller.

310
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,590
So it does increase your statistical power
if you,

311
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,670
indeed, meet the proportional odds
assumption.

312
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,550
And just to show you graphically, here's
the predicted probabilities,

313
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,700
the cumulative probabilities, as a
function of eating disorder score,

314
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,880
this is what our model predicts if we just
graph out across all the possible scores.

315
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,470
So the blue line represents the predicted
probability of

316
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,440
being amenorrhea equals being in that most
severe category.

317
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,410
The red line here,

318
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:30,960
represents the probability of being have,
having any menstrual irregularity.

319
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,100
So a, the blue line is sort of included in
this red line.

320
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,010
And you can see that as you go up in
score,

321
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,220
eventually you have more than a 75% chance
of having any menstrual irregularity.

322
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,270
And that's just the, the picture for the
ordinal logistic model.

323
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,070
Now, I just want to mention some other
cases where you

324
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:50,410
might want to think about applying an
ordinal logistic.

325
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,000
So, a classic ordinal variable is the
likert scale.

326
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,580
Sometimes, on a questionnaire, we'll ask
people did they strongly disagree,

327
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,470
disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree.

328
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,470
Something like that.

329
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,890
Often times when people.

330
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,749
Do with these datas.

331
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,120
When they get the data in at the end of

332
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,010
the day they just say while I'm going to
collapse everybody.

333
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,380
I'm only going to put people here or here
and

334
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,190
I'm going to rate, run a regular logistic
reg-ration comparing any agreement with

335
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,210
any disagreement or neutrality.

336
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,430
Well that might be appropriate in some
cases.

337
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,560
Especially if you have really small
numbers in some of these categories.

338
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,400
But you are losing information that way
and

339
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,160
it makes you think well why didn't you set
up the questionnaire with only two

340
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,900
questions, if you're just going to collect
the data at the end of the day.

341
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,190
So, if you have a reasonably large sample
size and

342
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,470
you actually have enough people on each
one of these categories, you could

343
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,280
consider doing instead of collapsing,
actually doing an ordinal logistic here.

344
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,110
You'll pull more information out of the
data that way.

345
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,290
What would the ordinal logistic actually
look like just to show you

346
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:50,120
in the case where we have five levels of
ordinal categorical variable.

347
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,880
We are going to be again thinking about
cumulative outcomes.

348
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,350
We are going to get, kind of get your mind
around this.

349
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,170
The logest is going to be cumulative
logist so we are going to be

350
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,820
comparing sort of the most extreme answer
the strongly agree versus everything else.

351
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,000
So theres going to be a logit that looks
at the probability of being only in

352
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,500
category five versus any of the other four
categories.

353
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,980
But then we're going to have cumulative
logits,

354
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,810
and we're going to get more inclusive.

355
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,330
So then we're going to compare any
agreement at all.

356
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,320
Agree or strongly agrees in the bottom.

357
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,250
Three.

358
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,790
Then we're going to compare the top three,
you know,

359
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,920
neutrality or agreement, to having any
disagreements.

360
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,010
And then, finally, we're going to compare
anything that's

361
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,780
not strong disagreement to strongest
agreement.

362
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,520
So my, our model is going to be combining
all of those.

363
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,200
For comparisons.

364
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,550
And so again you have to make the, you
have to meet the assumption then

365
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,770
that we're kind of having equal jumps
across those different comparisons,

366
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,180
that the odds ratio's going to be the same
in those cases or reasonably similar.

367
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,750
But it's worth considering to see if that
is true in your data if that is

368
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,550
you could do ordinal logistic.

369
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:00,160
Which has advantages, in that you're
taking in an account.

370
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,580
All these information eon again since
you're only estimating

371
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,690
a single observation or a single beta.

372
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,510
You're increasing your statistical power
compared with.

373
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,420
Somehow doing this with a multinomial
regression.

374
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,420
So just to summarize the advantages and
disadvantages of ordinal logistic.

375
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,640
If you have a case where you meet the
proportional odds assumption,

376
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,040
the ordinal logistic regression has more
statistical power than the multinomial,

377
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,400
logistic regression, because you're using
all observation to estimate a single beta.

378
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,730
Rather than dividing up your observations
into the different categories and

379
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,300
estimating separate datas.

380
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,760
So you do have an increase in statistical
power.

381
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,640
Of course it does require that you meet
this proportional odds assumption.

382
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,130
Its works very well in our example data
test today.

383
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:46,650
We met that very well but you can imagine
cases where the jumps across different

384
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,370
categories are in fact not equal and that
you wouldn't actually be able to use.

385
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,090
Ordinal logistic in those cases.
