1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
This module will briefly review some of
the mathematical concepts that

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:10,985
will help you understand the topics
covered in this statistics course.

3
00:00:10,985 --> 00:00:14,560
In this video, we'll be focusing on five
concepts, factorials and

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,705
summations, the equation of a line, and

5
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:21,820
the exponential function, as well as the
natural logarithm.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,320
So, jumping right into factorials.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,510
Factorials are denoted with an exclamation
point as shown here.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,360
The formal definition for a factorial, and
I'll repeat this,

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,704
is that it's the product of all positive
integers less than or equal to the number.

10
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:42,500
Again, it's the product of all positive
integers less than or

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,240
equal to this number.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,630
Now, if I say that in another way that's
like saying that when you

13
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,900
take the factorial of a number, you're
multiplying all the positive whole

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,030
numbers between that number and the number
1.

15
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,082
So, let me illustrate that with an
example.

16
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:03,305
3 factorial, whats 3 factorial?

17
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:07,630
It's 3 times 2 times 1, and that's equal
to 6.

18
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,802
Okay, the key takeaway here is that 3
factorial is simply a number,

19
00:01:12,802 --> 00:01:15,812
3 factorial is equal to 6.

20
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:18,777
Let's go over another example.

21
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:20,520
What's 6 factorial?

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,920
So, we're going to be multiplying all the
numbers between 6 and 1.

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,162
So, that means 6 factorial is going to
equal 6 times 5

24
00:01:28,162 --> 00:01:32,580
times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

25
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,180
And we're going to do a little bit of Math
here.

26
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,190
And we're going to figure out that 6
factorial is equal to 720.

27
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,760
Again, the big takeaway here, being that 6
factorial is simply a number.

28
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,980
It's equal to 720.

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:54,720
It's you can think about it as if it's
another way of writing 720.

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,420
One thing to know about factorials is that
you

31
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,770
can only take the factorial of a positive
integer.

32
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,950
You can't take factorials of negative
numbers and get a real solution.

33
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,562
One thing you'll have to remember about
factorials is what 0 factorial equals.

34
00:02:14,562 --> 00:02:16,982
0 factorial equals 1.

35
00:02:16,982 --> 00:02:22,510
Again 0 factorial is defined as 1.

36
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,360
Before I move on to summations one last
thing I

37
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,365
want to go over with factorials is a trick
for how to simplify them.

38
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:37,340
Let's say you come across a problem 13
factorial divided by 10 factorial.

39
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,910
Because you know the definition of the
factorial,

40
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,440
you're thinking to yourself, gosh these
are going to be really large numbers.

41
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,181
I'm going to have to multiply 13 times 12
times 11 times 10, all the way down to 1.

42
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:50,030
Do that again on the bottom.

43
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,960
Well, you can also rewrite this top part.

44
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,215
But instead of going all the way down to
1, you can stop here and

45
00:02:58,215 --> 00:03:01,380
finish off this expression with 10
factorial.

46
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,135
And the reason I'm going to do that is so

47
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:07,850
that I can cancel out the same expression
on the top and bottom of this fraction.

48
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,400
Remember, I can do this because 10
factorial is a number.

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,590
I don't know what number it is, off the
top of my head.

50
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,640
It's a very large number, but I can cancel
that.

51
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,255
And that leaves me with something very
manageable.

52
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:22,630
13 time 12 times 11, which happens to
equal 1716.

53
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:29,400
So, this is just a trick for simplifying
factorials

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,420
if you ever come across a problem like
this.

55
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,340
Summations are expressed with the capital
Greek letter sigma, okay?

56
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,180
And whenever you see a summation symbol,

57
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,070
I want you to focus on these three areas,
okay?

58
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,635
This first part on the bottom of the
sigma,

59
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:46,480
it represents the lower bound of the
summation.

60
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,679
This top part, number 2 represents the
upper bound, very intuitive.

61
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:55,460
And then this third part,

62
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,430
on the side is the expression that you're
going to be summing over.

63
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,959
And let me illustrate what I mean by that
with an example.

64
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,470
Okay?

65
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,785
So lets say your index variable right
here.

66
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:08,920
Your lower bound is going to be one.

67
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,090
You're going to be going all the way to 6
,and we're going to be iterating over i.

68
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,670
What does that mean?

69
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,160
Well, it means we're going to start at 1.

70
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,460
And every time we add a term to this
expression,

71
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,590
we're going to iterate i by 1 until we
reach 6.

72
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:29,534
So, that means 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus
5 plus 6.

73
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:30,230
Okay?

74
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,030
And that equals 21.

75
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,510
Okay?
Just like with factorials,

76
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,980
this complicated looking expression is
just a number.

77
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:43,060
It's another way of writing 21.

78
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,040
Another key point here is to realize that
I'm adding all of

79
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,590
these because these are all equal to i.

80
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,100
And that's the expression that we're
summing over.

81
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,010
Okay, let me illustrate this with another
example.

82
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,680
So, very similar to the last one, except
we're going to be summing over 7 i.

83
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,033
Okay, so this is going to look like this.

84
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:09,529
We're going to start at the lower bound,

85
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:13,030
okay, and end when we reach the upper
bound.

86
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,760
Whatever that definition is.

87
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,640
In this case, it's still 1 and 6.

88
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,438
So, what we're going to do here is
multiply 7 times 1.

89
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:24,340
7 times 2.

90
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,900
Okay.
All the way until we reach 7 times 6.

91
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:36,190
And you might realize that you can take
out the 7 from this expression, okay?

92
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,275
To give yourself something that looks like
this.

93
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:44,640
7 times the quantity 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus
4 plus 5 plus 6.

94
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,060
Of course, and because we did this last
problem, we know that, that's 21.

95
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:58,630
So, this expression right here results in
7 times 21, okay.

96
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,860
So, let me rate, rewrite that in another
way.

97
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:07,510
So, that results in 7 times this
summation.

98
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,620
If you'll look at these two carefully,

99
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:16,250
what you'll realize is that all I did was
move this 7 to the outside.

100
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,210
Okay?
This illustrates one property of

101
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,060
summations, there are multiple properties.

102
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,920
I won't go into them in this video.

103
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:28,610
But I just wanted to give you a taste of
what knowing these properties can do and

104
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,042
how they can help you simplify much more
complicated expressions.

105
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:35,730
One more example with summations.

106
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,090
Now, let's imagine that you have some
data.

107
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:44,946
Okay, let's imagine that you have five
data points labeled x 1 to x 5, okay?

108
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:52,096
And let's imagine that these values are 2,
4, 6, 8, and 10.

109
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:57,290
Okay, we call this we say that these data,
this data is indexed.

110
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,020
And what that means is that this first
point, okay, corresponds to x sub 1.

111
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,274
Second point corresponds to x sub 2, etc.

112
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:11,270
And each of these points corresponds to an
actual value in the data set.

113
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:16,430
So, I can use the summation to sum either
part or this whole set of numbers.

114
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,350
Okay, and let me illustrate that.

115
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,702
Lets say with something like this.

116
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:24,650
Okay, so what is this expression going to
equal?

117
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:31,370
Well, if I write it out, this is going to
be x sub 3 plus x sub 4 plus x sub 5,

118
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:39,179
which corresponds to 6 plus 8 plus 10,
which is 24, okay?

119
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:43,550
So, this real illustrates a more practical
example of

120
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,740
how you can think about summations.

121
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,525
And how they can be helpful to you.

122
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:51,265
When thing about large sets of data.

123
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:56,240
Probably the most common form that you'll
encounter when you're looking at

124
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,570
the equation of a line will be slope
intercept form,

125
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,650
and that will work like this.

126
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,380
y equals mx plus b.

127
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,810
You've probably seen this before.

128
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:14,870
So, m represents the slope, b represents
the y intercept.

129
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,880
Okay, that's the point at which this line
intersects the y axis.

130
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,260
And y and x are, of course, the y
coordinate.

131
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:30,220
The corresponding y and x coordinates for
points that lie on this line.

132
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:37,330
Now, let's illustrate what we just went
over, again, with an example.

133
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,660
Lets say y equals 2x plus 6.

134
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,850
Now, if I ask you what the slope is,

135
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,442
you're going to tell me that the slope is
2.

136
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:49,565
Because this 2 corresponds to this m.

137
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,020
Okay?

138
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,604
And similarly, if I ask you what the y
intercept is.

139
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:58,045
You're going to tell me that it's 6,
because it corresponds to b.

140
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:03,130
More accurately, the y intercept in this

141
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:08,788
case is going to be 0 comma 6.

142
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:18,420
Now, let me talk a little bit more about
the slope.

143
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,550
So, slope is defined as the change in y
over change in x.

144
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:31,350
And another way of remembering that is by
remembering this phrase rise over run.

145
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:39,840
And again, I want to illustrate all these
concepts with the example from before.

146
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,960
And this time I'm going to graph this.

147
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,600
So, this is your y axis and this is your x
axis.

148
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,290
So, we know that the y intercept is 6.

149
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,480
So, I'm going to pick this point to be the
y intercept.

150
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,992
And I know that the slope is 2.

151
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:57,990
So, I'm going to go up two points for
every one point that I go over.

152
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,858
Or do the, and also do the opposite.

153
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:01,746
Go down two for

154
00:10:01,746 --> 00:10:07,328
every one point that I moved to the left,
one unit I moved to the left.

155
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:12,284
And connecting these dots, gives me the
graph of this line.

156
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:15,697
Moving onto the exponential function.

157
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:21,495
The exponential function is denoted like
this with the letter e.

158
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,671
Sometimes you might see it written like
this.

159
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:27,237
Don't get confused, these are the same
things.

160
00:10:27,237 --> 00:10:31,710
It's important to note that e is a number.

161
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:37,779
e is equal to 2.71828, etcetera, etcetera,
etcetera.

162
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:43,479
And so if you find yourself forgetting
this it might be useful

163
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:51,645
to remember e to the x as approximately
equal 2.72 raised to the x.

164
00:10:51,645 --> 00:10:56,520
Now, if you want to check to make sure
you're doing this right.

165
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,275
e to the 3 will equal 20.085, and you can
use

166
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:07,353
that in Google or your calculator to check
that you're doing this the right way.

167
00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:14,787
All the normal rules of exponents also
apply to the exponential function.

168
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:19,389
And what I mean by that let's say e to the
0.

169
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:24,817
Any number raised to the power to zero
will equal 1.

170
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,960
also, any number raised to a negative
exponent will be

171
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,842
one over that number raised to the
positive exponent.

172
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:37,708
And that's where I want to leave the
exponential function.

173
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:42,490
Please do note that the exponential
function is used very commonly in

174
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,160
the sciences.

175
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,740
And that's because it has some appealing
Mathematical properties that

176
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,780
allow scientists to model a behavior they
see in nature very, very well.

177
00:11:51,780 --> 00:12:00,240
Moving on to the natural log you can write
the natural logarithm like this,

178
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,280
log base e of x or more commonly as ln of
x.

179
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:12,070
And the main idea that I want you to take
away with regard to this course is

180
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,670
that the natural log and the exponential
function are inverses of each other.

181
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,225
And what that means is that they undo each
other.

182
00:12:18,225 --> 00:12:24,550
So, the natural log of e to the x will
just be x.

183
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,350
And some other like e, to the natural log
of x will also be x.

184
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:36,117
And this is important because when we're
doing certain statistical regressions,

185
00:12:36,117 --> 00:12:39,710
we're going to have an expression that
looks like this, and

186
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,580
we're going to want to know.

187
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,380
We're going to just want to isolate what's
inside the natural log.

188
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:50,660
And so, we're going to raise this to the e
to get that middle part.

189
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,099
All the rules about logarithms also apply
to natural log.

190
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,910
And I'll illustrate a few of those here.

191
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,900
So, the log of 1 will always equal 0.

192
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,990
The log of 0 will always be undefined.

193
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:12,050
And you can't really take the natural log
of a negative number.

194
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:20,480
At least you won't that won't result in a
real solution.

195
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:29,909
So, that concludes this Math review and I
hope you found it useful.
