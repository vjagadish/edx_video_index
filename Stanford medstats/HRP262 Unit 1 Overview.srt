2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,400
Welcome to HRP 262.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,860
This is the third and

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,880
final course in the three quarter
biostatistics sequence that I teach.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,080
This quarter should be a lot of fun,

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,590
we're going to be dealing with
longitudinal data,

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,930
which is when you have data measured over
time.

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,560
So just to give you a brief overview of
the topics that we'll be

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,900
covering in HRP 262.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,300
The first part of the course, we're
going to talk about survival analysis,

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,100
this is when you have time-to-event
outcomes.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,540
We'll go over Kaplan Meier methods, which
may be a review for some of you.

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,820
I'll talk briefly about parametric
survival models, and

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,980
then we'll spend quite a bit of time on
Cox Regression,

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,510
which is the most commonly used regression
method for survival data.

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,610
The second part of the course is going to
focus on repeated measures data.

17
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,850
This is when you measure people at
multiple time points.

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,160
You had, maybe have measured their
predictors multiple times, and

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,130
you may have measured their outcomes
multiple times.

20
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,740
I will cover, I will, I will, I will do a
brief of linear regression and ANOVA just

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,920
to make sure we're all on the same page,
before we jump into repeated measures.

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,740
With repeated measures data, it's going to
be extremely important to visualize, and

23
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,330
graph everything to get a sense of what's
going on in the data.

24
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,730
The repeated measures part, the time part,
does add some complexity.

25
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,270
And graphing is going to be even more
important for

26
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,020
sorting through some of that complexity.

27
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,390
So we'll talk about ways to graph a data
in different data structures.

28
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,870
The test that we are going to cover for

29
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,220
analyzing repeated measures data if we are
just wanting to compare groups and

30
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,780
not adjust for anything, we can use
repeated measures ANOVA.

31
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,940
And if we want to some kind of regression,
the two regression techniques I'll be

32
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,549
talking about, are generalized estimating
equations and mixed model.

33
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,180
Just to kind of show you where all of
these topics fit in our kind of

34
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,330
big chart of statistical tests.

35
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,060
So this chart is showing you for different
outcome variables whether or

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,620
not you have independent or correlated
observations.

37
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,070
All of that helps you to decide which
statistical test to choose.

38
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,360
A lot of these tests we covered in the
biostatistic sequence thus far.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,330
So what we're going to hit this term,
again we

40
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,720
are going to hit time-to-event outcomes
which we haven't talked much about so far.

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,220
So that's why I want to include
Kaplan-Meier statistics,

42
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,670
a little bit of parametric regression, and
a lot on Cox regression.

43
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,780
When we turn to the section on repeated
measures data.

44
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,680
If we have continuous outcomes, we are
going to dealing with

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,510
repeated measure ANOVA, mixed models and
GE modelling.

46
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,930
We'll also talk a little bit of a, the
situation where we have binary or

47
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,430
categorical data or even count data where
we might use GE modelling.

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,060
Just a little preview to what we

49
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,600
are going to be talking about starting
this week.

50
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,250
Survival analysis.

51
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,250
So this curve here shows a very early
example of survival analysis.

52
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:03,770
It's way back from 1669, so somebody, a
mathematician, drew a curve of longevity.

53
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,950
And it's a really interesting curve to
look at because you'll see very

54
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,220
quickly that if we were in 1669,

55
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,490
a lot of us wouldn't still be alive, at
this point in our lives.

56
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:20,360
So you can see that the X axis here is
ages and what were looking

57
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,590
at here at the Y axis, is survival, so
this is the percent surviving.

58
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,180
And this is generally how we're going to
draw survival curves.

59
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,710
So by about age six, there was only about
64 out of 100 people still surviving,

60
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:41,500
that means about a third of people in 1869
would die before the age of six.

61
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,300
It's not so good when you look along here
at that age 16.

62
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,690
There's only about 40%, 40 out 100 people
surviving.

63
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,360
You go to age 20, it's only about a third
of us left.

64
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,100
Age 26, there's only about a quarter of
people left.

65
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,800
By age 36, five-sixths of the people had
died, and

66
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,040
only one sixth of the people were going to
live past the age of 36 back then.

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,010
So unfortunately, that means most of us,
if we were living in 1669,

68
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,710
wouldn't still be around.

69
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,970
And then you can see that there's you know
a tail end here, a couple of people live

70
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,270
our to 76 or 86, but longevity curves have
obviously changed a great

71
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,800
deal in just a couple of hundred years
which I find really fascinating.

72
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,880
And that's a tribute to modern medicine
that now most people are going to

73
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,450
survive much much longer than this.

74
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,410
But this is an example of our survival
curve.

75
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,920
And that's what we're going to dealing
with this week, is just how to draw and

76
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,990
interpret and understand survival curves.
