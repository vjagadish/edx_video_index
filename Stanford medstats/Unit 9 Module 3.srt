1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,150
In this next module,

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,120
I'm going to talk about one of the
assumptions of linear regression that you

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,970
really should test if you've got
continuous predictors in your model.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,500
I think it's often an ignored assumption.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,460
So when you're reading papers, you should
look to see whether or

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,590
not it was tested, and

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,810
if you're doing your own data analysis, it
would be important to run this test.

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,110
This assumption is something called linear
in the logit, and it's as simple as just

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,030
when we do a linear regression, remember,
what do you want to do, of course?

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,160
When you do a linear regression, you
want to do the plot.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,740
And you want to see if it actually looks
like a line.

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,570
This one looks like a line.

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,460
Here's a scatter plot that doesn't look
like a line.

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,140
It actually looks like a quadratic.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,700
So, for linear regression, it's really
easy, because we can just plot x

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,190
against y, and we can see immediately if
if looks like the, the scatter plot.

17
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,255
Roughly fits a line.

18
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,370
For logistic regression,

19
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,680
we're still fitting lines, but it's harder
to draw this graphic.

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,430
Because the outcome remember, is this
logit function, and

21
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,700
there's no way to directly see the logit
function.

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:15,710
The best you can do is, I did some logit
plots in the first module for

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,950
this week, and how I did that, in order to
be able to do that,

24
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,040
I had to group people according to their
level on the predictor.

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,770
So I can group people who did the lowest
number, amount of homework.

26
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,400
And you know like the 10 lowest, 10 people
with the lowest homework time.

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,150
And then the next 10, and then the next
10, so

28
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,400
I have to somehow group people in order
that I can calculate the proportion who

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:43,190
have had the binary outcome from the
proportion I can then calculate the logit.

30
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,470
If you do that then you can make some
plots.

31
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,500
But, of course, the plot is going to
depend slightly on how you bend people,

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,600
how you group people.

33
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,210
So I'm going to show you in a minute some
examples of testing this linear in

34
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,050
the logit assumption and you will see that
I,

35
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,440
we'll usually run several different graphs
with several different bin sizes.

36
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,330
So that I can get a sense of the data
without you know, being too arbitrary.

37
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,000
And we're looking for that what we're
testing is that,

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,470
if you have a continuous predictor in
logistic regression.

39
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,800
What we're doing is we're fitting a line
that says, that continuous predictor acts

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,720
Has a linear relationship, roughly, with
the logit of the outcome.

41
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,960
So you actually want to make that plot as
best you can, and

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,670
see if the relationship is really linear
or if maybe it's not.

43
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,725
If it's something else, if the
relationship looks, you know,

44
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:34,194
quadratic, that means you're going to have
to model a quadratic variable for x.

45
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:36,420
You're going to put in the x squared into
the model.

46
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,030
Or you might have to transform that
continuous variable into

47
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,220
a categorical variable.

48
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,910
It may not be simply fine to just put that

49
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,775
continuous predictor directly into the
model.

50
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:49,860
Notice if you have a binary or

51
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,304
a categorical predictor, you do not have
to worry about this assumption.

52
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:57,360
Because if you have a binary variable, a
binary predictor,

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,210
you're only doing a 0, 1.

54
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,550
You've got only two dots, therefore, and
any time you connect two dots,

55
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,660
it's automatically a line.

56
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,460
If you have a categorical predictor,
you're going to be dummy coding it, so

57
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,790
you're going to have a series of zero
ones.

58
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,190
Those are all going to make lines, so this
is only a worry when you have a continuous

59
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,877
predictor in logistic regression.

60
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:16,985
I want to show you some real examples with
real data.

61
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:22,920
Various examples where I've had to draw
linear in the logit plots.

62
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,780
This example was from a data set where the
outcome is heart disease.

63
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,700
The predictor that we're looking at here
called tobacco,

64
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,740
this is the number of cigarettes smoked
per day.

65
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,760
And I grouped the data set-up into four
bins, as well as ten bins,

66
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,380
just to give us a sense of the
relationship between the number of

67
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,520
cigarettes per day and the logit of heart
disease.

68
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,270
And again, I have to group people, and
what I'm graphing here is the,

69
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,590
I'm graphing their mean cigarettes per
day.

70
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,250
The mean cigarettes per day for the group
against the logit for that group.

71
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,810
The observed logit for that group.

72
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,320
What you can see here is that, for

73
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,390
this particular variable, the number of
cigarettes per day.

74
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,200
It does not look linear in the logit.

75
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,680
The relationship between cigarettes per
day, and our,

76
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,260
the logit of having heart disease appears
curvilinear.

77
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,460
There appears to be a curved relationship.

78
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,100
In both of these graphics, you can see it,

79
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,120
that there's sort of a curved relationship
here.

80
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,730
Why is that?

81
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,850
Well, think about the variable, cigarettes
per day.

82
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,060
You have a bunch of people who smoke 0
cigarettes per day and

83
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,300
then you got people increasing on their
cigarettes per day.

84
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,070
What you're seeing in this graphic here,
is when you

85
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,700
jump from being a non-smoker to smoking,
you know, some little amount per day,

86
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,930
there's a huge jump in your odds at risk
getting heart disease.

87
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,190
There's a major steep jump, jump.

88
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,680
But then there's sort of diminishing
returns,

89
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,480
once you're already a smoker, whether you
smoke.

90
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,724
A couple cigarettes per day, or more, it,

91
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:51,580
your risk does go up but it doesn't go up
as steeply.

92
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,592
And then when you go from being a moderate
smoker to being a heavy smoker,

93
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:58,730
your risk also goes up but it goes up even
less steeply.

94
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,580
So the relationship is really curved,
rather than linear.

95
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,815
How might you account for this?

96
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:07,510
Probably the best way is to think about
cigarette smoking as

97
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,280
a categorical variable.

98
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,280
You might want to model this as non
smokers versus light to

99
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,310
moderate smokers versus heavy smokers.

100
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,280
And that might be the best way to actually
model this.

101
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,210
This might be the case where it makes
sense to treat tobacco smoking

102
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,580
cigarettes per day as a categorical
variable rather than continuous.

103
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,620
So that's an example that violated the
linear in the logit assumption.

104
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,630
Here's an example where we're actually
meeting the linear in the logit

105
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,840
assumption pretty well.

106
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,070
This was some data I had On women
athletes.

107
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,650
And the outcome variable here is low bone
mineral density.

108
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,200
So, low skeletal strength.

109
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,400
It turns out that women athletes sometimes
don't menstruate normally.

110
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,810
And, if you don't have normal menses, that
actually can reduce your,

111
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,330
your skeletal strength, your, your bone
mineral, bone mineral density.

112
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,430
So that, this was the data set.

113
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,050
Looking at that, again, I did too many in
the linear pot so

114
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,190
I'm getting a sense depending on how I bin
things.

115
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,880
How many people per group that I'm getting
the right relationship.

116
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,280
So I grouped into about twelve bins, as
well as five bins, and

117
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,820
you can see that there's of course more
local noise when you have twelve bins.

118
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,200
But the pattern looks pretty similar in
both cases.

119
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,910
I would say that this is pretty close to
fitting lines.

120
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,870
Not a perfect line, but

121
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,980
it looks like it actually is reasonably
linear in the logit.

122
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,990
In both cases you can imagine kind of a
drawing a line again with lots of points.

123
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,660
There's going to be some local variability
but essentially that's well fit by a line.

124
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,030
So, in this case our predictor variable
here is

125
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,486
the number of menses the number of
menstral periods per year.

126
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:45,260
So, normal is sort of around 12.

127
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,870
A lot of women athletes are having many
less than that.

128
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,530
And it turns out, there is a linear
relationship here as the number of

129
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:57,200
menstrual periods goes up, from 0 to all
the way up to normal, 12,

130
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,960
the chances, the odds of getting low or
having low bone density go down.

131
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,600
It appears to be well modeled as linear,
so

132
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,490
I could put the number of menstrual cycles
per year as the predictor variable.

133
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,940
And get an odds ratio for every one unit
increase in menstrual, in menses.

134
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,970
How does that decrease my odds of getting
low bone marrow density?

135
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:26,291
This one seems reasonably modeled as a
linear variable.
