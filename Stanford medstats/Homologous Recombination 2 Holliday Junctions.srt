00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,690
This is Chapter 2 on our series on
Homologous Recombination, and

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:16,130
what this is, is going to be a description
of holiday junctions are resolved.

3
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,395
So I'm starting out with a diagram,

4
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:21,471
showing the formation of two holiday
junctions.

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,690
Following a double strand break in the
blue chromosome, and

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:32,180
the formation of the holiday junctions by
forming a D loop in conjunction

7
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,080
with the intact red chromosome, which did
not have the double strand break.

8
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,709
I've colored the DNA carefully.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,180
According to the sequences that were
copied, so that when,

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,330
when a sequence was copied from three
prime overhang of the blue chromosome,

11
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,500
for example right here, but it was copying
off of the right chromosome,

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,260
I've drawn in red, and similarly down
here.

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,270
Where there's a three pry man for

14
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:07,340
the, blue chromosome that was then used as
the primer

15
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,190
for synthesizing DNA from the red
chromosome, so that's all in red.

16
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,248
So, this is two holiday junctions.

17
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:18,090
Now, holiday junctions.

18
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,680
Can be resolved by making cleavages,
because these two

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,840
chromosomes are now attached by the DNA at
two different locations.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,173
And so, one way of making the cleavages is
by making two longitudinal cuts.

21
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:37,473
So, I'm going to draw in.

22
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:43,640
They cut here, okay?

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,330
That's a pair of longitudinal cuts, and I

24
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,370
could draw a pair of longitudinal cuts
here, and here, and

25
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,538
if I do make those cuts, then all I have
to do is take.

26
00:01:57,538 --> 00:02:04,510
The three prime end of the blue chromosome
up here,

27
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:11,500
and join it to the five prime end of this
red piece of DNA.

28
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,956
So, that as a result of those two cuts, I
am now going to have the following.

29
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:21,273
So we're going to draw that in.

30
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:28,374
I'll have the red chromosome, and then the
red DNA and now the blue DNA.

31
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:31,625
So the 3 prime end, 5 prime end.

32
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:35,292
And now I'll put-

33
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:39,994
I'll put in what happens to the upper
strand, upper DNA here,

34
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,779
the upper piece of DNA.

35
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:46,519
I'm going to have the three prime end over
here, and we're going to come over here.

36
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,190
And we're going to come up to a cut on
that strand.

37
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,090
And that cut

38
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,781
[BLANK_AUDIO]

39
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:55,509
will allow

40
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,371
[BLANK_AUDIO]

41
00:02:58,371 --> 00:02:59,222
ligation.

42
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:08,500
At this point, let's continue with the
cuts at the other holiday junction.

43
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,390
So, this bottom strand on the upper
chromosome, is going to end up,

44
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,080
being joined, right at this point.

45
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,869
Okay.

46
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,880
After those cuts.

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,130
Now let's draw the resolution of the
holiday junction and

48
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,900
how it affects the bottom chromosome.

49
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,840
And as you can see, I'll draw this for
you, the bottom strand

50
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,810
of the bottom chromosome of course is
intact, nothing was ever done to it.

51
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,630
But the upper strand of course after the
cuts.

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:54,430
What will happen is, red DNA will get
ligated

53
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,900
to red DNA, there may be a little bit of
blue here,

54
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,450
but then that will be ligated to the red
DNA.

55
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,520
Just so.

56
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,460
Okay.
So the bottom strand of DNA

57
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:16,240
here is going to be virtually, completely
red.

58
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,610
So the intact, the original intact DNA
has, is been restored.

59
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,870
after the resolution of the holiday
junction.

60
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,330
The difference is the upper strand -

61
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:35,280
the upper DNA molecule, now has been
repaired by copying from

62
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,650
the anti chromosome and that's the areas
that were copied are shown in red here.

63
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,940
And this kind of resolution of the Holiday
junction,

64
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,350
actually converts some of the sequence in
the blue chromosome to red sequence.

65
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,010
And if the sequences aren't exactly the
same, you're going to have a,

66
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,940
a slight difference.

67
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,550
Of course, since this is modest
recombination,

68
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,670
the sequences are pretty close to the
same.

69
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,670
But.

70
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,950
There will be some differences depending
on whether the blue chromosome and

71
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,630
the red chromosome have exactly the same
sequences.

72
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:18,054
And, because they're slightly different,
we call this process here gene conversion.

73
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:22,560
So, the damaged chromosome has undergone a
gene conversion.

74
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,420
All right.

75
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,440
Now, there is a different way you can
resolve the holiday junctions and

76
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,280
we're now going to talk about that.

77
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:39,090
So I'm going to erase this way of
repairing, or

78
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:46,520
resolving the two holiday junctions and
show you a different way to resolve them.

79
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,570
So let's get the eraser, get ride of gene
conversion here.

80
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,330
And let's see -

81
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,311
I'm going to be judicious in how I do
this,

82
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:04,240
because I'm going to make one pair of cuts
the same.

83
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,700
And so, one pair of cuts will still be

84
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,990
these longitudinal cuts that I drew
previously.

85
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,650
But the other pair of cuts are going to be
transverse cuts, and

86
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,890
here are the transverse cuts.

87
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,244
[BLANK_AUDIO]

88
00:06:21,244 --> 00:06:26,000
All right, now as a result of those
transverse cuts.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,550
I'm going to have a different species.

90
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,340
So.
Let me erase things here.

91
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,760
Let's see, let's clean this thing up a
little bit.

92
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,040
Let's get rid of that.

93
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,550
Now, we're going to make these transfers
cuts and

94
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,220
I'm going to show them to you here.

95
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,230
Where the cuts are.

96
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,560
So imagine that this enzyme here nicks the
DNA.

97
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,920
Boom!
There it goes, and boom!

98
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,720
There it goes.

99
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,560
Let me restore that arrow so you can
remember where the cut was.

100
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,650
There you go.

101
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,358
And so, that is where the transverse cuts
are.

102
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:12,860
Now keeping track of the 3 prime and 5
prime ends, all right.

103
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:19,610
There's going to be a 3 prime end over
here.

104
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,850
Okay?
And a 5 prime end on this side of the cut.

105
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,543
[BLANK_AUDIO]

106
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:28,394
All right.

107
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:29,084
And

108
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:32,780
[BLANK_AUDIO]

109
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,470
there is no cut here, so this is still
okay.

110
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:43,589
And, there is no cut over here, so this is
still okay.

111
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,170
Alright.

112
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:58,218
But there was a cut down here, so I'm
going to redraw it for

113
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:03,807
you, drawing in the five prime and three
prime ends.

114
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:05,200
So.

115
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,110
I've made these two cuts.

116
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,870
I have four single stranded ends.

117
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:14,320
And those have to be rejoined in a common
attoric recombinational way.

118
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,890
So.

119
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,390
This.

120
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:22,000
Three prime end is going to end up joined
to this five prime end.

121
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,810
And this three prime end is going to be
joined to this five prime end.

122
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:34,570
So.
Let me denote that in the following way.

123
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,135
Just so we can keep track of bookkeeping.

124
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:42,360
I'm going to make a triangle here cause
this three prime end.

125
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,200
Is going to be joined to this five prime
end.

126
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,350
That's a triangle and it's two red pieces
of DNA.

127
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,300
Okay?
And then I'm going to make,

128
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:01,500
a circle over here to denote.

129
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,770
Which two ends are going to be joined?

130
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,520
So, the circles will be joined.

131
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,400
One circle from the red DNA and one circle
from the blue DNA.

132
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,960
So that's how these things are going to be
joined.

133
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,230
So now, all we have to do is redraw this
sort of unfolding things,

134
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,810
and the way we can unfold things.

135
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:28,713
Is we can flip this strand and this strand
over,

136
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:33,306
and let me just draw an arrow for you.

137
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,320
So there's going to to be a flip between
these two, and

138
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,180
I'm going to show you how that looks as a
result.

139
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,960
What you're going to see now

140
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,340
[BLANK_AUDIO]

141
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,450
This is the first half, and

142
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,982
then this is going to be that triangle on
the upper strand.

143
00:09:53,982 --> 00:09:57,510
That's going to be joined to the triangle
on the lower strand after the flipping.

144
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,280
Okay.

145
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,050
[BLANK_AUDIO]

146
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,884
And this piece of DNA has been

147
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:18,104
flipped over

148
00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:25,560
at this end.

149
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,890
This is intact, nothing has happened to
it.

150
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,920
So, that's the 5 prime in.

151
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,050
That's, now, the new upper DNA.

152
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,190
[BLANK_AUDIO]

153
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:44,500
And now, the lower DNA, I'm going to draw
in here.

154
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:51,710
[BLANK_AUDIO]

155
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,210
No.

156
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:06,236
My prime end, and here's the five prime
end of the lower DNA.

157
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,210
All right.
Remember

158
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,700
[BLANK_AUDIO]

159
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,450
that's going to be joined to the circle on
the upper strand, so

160
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,350
I'm flip that over to the blue DNA.

161
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,860
So I'm going to actually make a little
blue circle, so

162
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,260
you can see that it came together.

163
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,680
[BLANK_AUDIO]

164
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,520
All right.

165
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:34,138
And actually, let me draw just so you can
see that

166
00:11:34,138 --> 00:11:38,630
there are two triangles here, and two
circles on the bottom.

167
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,820
So now you have two chromosomes that have
been restored and

168
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,600
they have been separated by resolution of
the holiday junction.

169
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,130
The resolution occurred, because of a
longitudinal cut.

170
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:53,090
At this holiday junction, and a transverse
cut at this holiday junction.

171
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,100
And as a result of the combination of the
longitudinal cut and

172
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,600
the transverse cut, okay?

173
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,330
What I end up with, is a chromosome, an
upper chromosome here,

174
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,300
that's starts out blue and ends up red.

175
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,260
And a lower chromosome here that starts
out red and ends up blue.

176
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,850
And so that is not an easy thing to draw
so

177
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,960
we have to congratua, congratulate
ourselves.

178
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,350
And, say Voila!

179
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,590
All right, what is this product called?

180
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,170
This product, this method of, or this
particular way

181
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,030
of resolving the two holiday junctions,
these products are now called a crossover.

182
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,350
So, I'll just write that.

183
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,698
Crossover from homogeneous recombination.

184
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:43,490
Okay, that was very complicated, but

185
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,220
if you keep track of the five prime and
three prime ends of the DNA.

186
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,780
You should be fine, so thank you very
much.
