00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,960
Hi, my name is Sharon Chan and I am from
Standford University.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,140
This video is on strategies microbes use
to exit the host.

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,930
It is part of our introduction to
microbiology module.

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,710
Exiting the host is an important step on
the lifestyle of a microbe.

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,562
Microbes must exit a host in order to
transmit to another host.

6
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:28,090
For physicians understanding how microbes
exit can help with strategies to prevent

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,640
transmission in, of infection to another
person and for diagnosing microbes.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,090
For some microbes exit and entry portals
are the same.

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,260
For other microbes, they are different.

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,409
In this video, we will discuss some common
exit strategies used by microbes.

11
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,850
Bacteria can employ virulence factors for
examples for toxins for exiting the host.

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,390
Vipera Cholera the bacteria that causes
Cholera toxin that results in

13
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,640
production of watery stools.

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,110
Vipera Cholera exist the host within the
watery stool.

15
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,760
People with Cholera produce up to one
liter hour of watery stool.

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,020
Each liter contains one trillion bacteria.

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,810
So much stool is released that a special
bed was developed to

18
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,390
measure the fluid loss.

19
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,400
It is called a cholera cot and is shown in
this image.

20
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,290
Viruses can produce skin lesions to exit a
host.

21
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,960
Herpes simplex virus produces a vesicular
lesions which contain infectious virus.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,300
When the vesicle ruptures, herpes simplex
virus can exit the host.

23
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,490
The virus can be transmitted to another
person by a simple kiss.

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,990
For fungi, dermatophytes such as this one
causing a severe athlete's foot

25
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,450
exit the host within skin cells that are
normally shed by the host.

26
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,890
However invasive fungi, do not exit the
host and

27
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,830
thus are not transmissible to another
host.

28
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,230
Invasive Fungi, such as aspergillus are
not communicable.

29
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,070
For parasites a common means of exiting a
host is to

30
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,000
shed eggs within the hosts stool.

31
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,155
The shape of parasite eggs can be useful
for diagnosis.

32
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:13,750
When examining these two samples under a
microscope.

33
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,010
The image shows a picture of an egg from a
schistosoms a type of

34
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,140
worm called a [UNKNOWN].

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,670
The position of the it's hook on the egg
distinguishes this schistosoms from

36
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,600
other species.

37
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:30,340
These eggs have to survive harsh
conditions outside of their host.

38
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,820
Potentially for long periods of time.

39
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,760
Thus eggs are developed to be resistant to
many types of environments and chemicals.

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Another type of worm is the pin worm, a
nemetode.

41
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,550
Unlike schistosoms, pin worms are a much
more common infection in the US.

42
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,770
Pin worms are in fact the most common
helminth infection in the United States.

43
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,480
The video shows an embroyanted egg with a
pinworm inside.

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,720
In contrast the shishisomes which shed
eggs in host stool female pinworms

45
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,140
migrate to the anus to deposit eggs, both
the migrating worm and

46
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,030
the egg are irritating to the skin causing
intense itching in the parianal region.

47
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,425
The eggs are sticky when deposited by the
worm.

48
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:16,590
School-age children will scratch around
the anus,

49
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,560
picking up eggs on their fingers and
fingernails.

50
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Invariably, these contaminated fingers
find their way into mouths,

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,340
depositing the egg into the
gastrointestinal tract.

52
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,290
Where it will later hatch a larvae,
completing the life cycle.

53
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,240
With the help of host behaviors,

54
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,829
pinworm eggs are a good example of a
successful exit strategy.

55
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,710
For some microbes, exiting the host can
also be done via vector.

56
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,580
Some members of bacteria, virus and

57
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,480
protozoa exit through blood sucking
vectors like this mosquito.

58
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,150
Microbes that use these strategies,

59
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,930
avoid harsh environments by using an
intermediate host.
