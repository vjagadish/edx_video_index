1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,500
In this module, we're going to tell you
about PROC GPLOT,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,260
which can be used to create scatter plots
and line plots.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,740
>> PROC GPLOT gives you a lot of control
over the scatter plots and line plots.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,290
Let's start with a basic scatter plot.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,930
>> By now you should be used to the syntax
for

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,410
the first line of your procedure in SAS.

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,488
We start out with PROC GPLOT, and then
specify our data set.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,407
In the next line, we have a plot
statement.

9
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:26,490
Which tells SAS that we want to make a
graph.

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,610
We type age asterisk weight, to specify
the variables in this plot.

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,360
The order is important here.

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,810
By defaults, the first variable will be on
the vertical axis, and

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,930
the second variable will be on the
horizontal axis.

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,400
>> As you can see,

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,090
we have a simple scatter plot that graphs
age versus weight.

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,551
Now suppose we want to add a title to this
plot.

17
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:51,539
After the first line of code specifying
PROC GPLOT and the data set of interest we

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,350
will write, title and age verses weight
within apostrophes.

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,120
Remember, always include apostrophes
around your titles.

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,450
>> As you can see,

21
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,440
by default, SAS will put the variable
names next to the x and y axis.

22
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,930
It's good to have a descriptive axis label
though.

23
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,775
We'll show you how to do that.

24
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:18,920
>> [NOISE] These label statements

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,780
are very similar to a title.

26
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,920
You start with label, specify the variable
you want,

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,600
and then make sure to put the labels
within apostrophes.

28
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,660
>> This way you can specify the units of
your axis.

29
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:42,010
>> SAS automatically determines the range
for

30
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,050
the x and y axis as well as the spacing of
the little tick marks.

31
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,810
Let's manually set the size of the axis.

32
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,280
To accomplish this, we need to return to
our code.

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,870
Underneath our, our label for age and
years.

34
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:03,954
We put axis1 order equals parenthesis 100
to 180 by 5.

35
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:16,329
And the next line we define axis2 with
order equals 20 to 100 by 5.

36
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:19,870
Notice how we specify the range of values
and the jumps between each value.

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,402
>> Next, we have to specify which axis is
going to be axis1 and

38
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:27,410
which one's going to be axis2.

39
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,680
To do this,

40
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,100
we go into the PLOT statement, and include
a forward slash to add some extra options.

41
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:39,538
We write vaxis which stands for vertical
axis, equals axis2.

42
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:46,270
And haxis which stands for horizontal
axis, equals axis1.

43
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,380
As you can see, we've now manually set the
range for our x and y axis.

44
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,100
Say you want to specify the height of your
axis labels.

45
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,460
You can do this in code as well.

46
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:09,025
After each axis statement, we would write,
label equals parenthesis h equals 3.

47
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:15,420
[SOUND]

48
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,230
Here we have h, which is short for height,
which controls the size of that label.

49
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,750
If you want a bigger label, you can use a
larger number here,

50
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,520
and if you want a smaller label, well, you
would use a smaller number.

51
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,440
We can also control the symbols that SAS
uses for the data points.

52
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,135
We only have one type of symbol here,
which SAS will refer to as symbol1.

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,980
So if you write a symbol1 statement, you
can change the settings.

54
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,290
Let's say we want a red triangle with a
smaller height.

55
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,520
We can specify this with v equals
triangle, for the shape.

56
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,700
C equals red, for the color.

57
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,580
And height equals 0.5 for the size.

58
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,580
There are many options for shapes and

59
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,590
colors that you can use, and you can find
these on the online documentation.

60
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,130
>> What if we want to add a line to our
graph?

61
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:16,926
In the same line where we specified our
symbol attributes,

62
00:04:16,926 --> 00:04:19,849
we can add i equals sm70s.

63
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,020
And line equals one.

64
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,140
In SAS, i stands for interpolation line,
and sm stands for smoothing.

65
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,110
The 70 tells SAS how smooth you want your
interpolation line to be.

66
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,090
The larger the value, the smoother the
line.

67
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:40,520
The lower the value, the closer your graph
will follow the noise in your data set.

68
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,516
The s at the end of sm70s stands for sort.

69
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:47,530
In order for SAS to make an interpolation
line,

70
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,270
it first has to sort the data behind the
scenes.

71
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,460
If you leave off this s at the end, your
line will look really weird.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,070
By adding line equals 1,

73
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,890
you're just selecting the type of line we
want SAS to draw.

74
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,740
Once again the online documentation will
show you a bunch of different options.

75
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,680
>> [SOUND]

76
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,520
What if we want to show different
subgroups of the data?

77
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,752
It might be nice to compare this plot for
men versus women.

78
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:17,170
[SOUND] We can do this in the plot
statement by adding in, equals gender.

79
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,980
When you do this, gender must be a
categorical variable.

80
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,590
SAS will now distinguish between males and

81
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,470
females, and it will add a legend to the
plot.

82
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,280
Now that we have two different subgroups
in the data,

83
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,840
we can also use two different symbols.

84
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,740
I added in a line for symbol2 in the code.

85
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,660
And I made it a blue square instead of a
red triangle.

86
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,210
As you can see, we now have different
symbols for men and

87
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,840
women, as well as a legend that will tell
us which one is which.

88
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,920
>> At this point, you can see we've added
a ton of options to our plot.

89
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,570
Most of your plots won't be this
complicated.

90
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,240
But if you want to add more options,

91
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,860
you can just look at this online SAS
documentation.
