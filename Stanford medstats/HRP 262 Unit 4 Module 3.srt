2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,350
In this next module,

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,180
I'm going to show you how to code time
changing predictors in SAS.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,070
And we'll also do something similar in the
lab, but this'll serve as an introduction.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,933
[BLANK_AUDIO]

6
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:21,824
So going back to made up data set that I
made you write the likelihood for, so

7
00:00:21,824 --> 00:00:25,328
this was a data set which was looking at
time to death, and

8
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:31,000
weight was measured at baseline, 3 months,
6 months and 9 months into the study.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,820
And I, the code, the way these variables
are coded, is w0, w3, w6 and w9.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,370
I've named those variables that.

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,350
I told you that I actually, this is a mock
data set and

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,650
these estimates are kind of unstable, but
I still went ahead and

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,460
put this data into SAS and [INAUDIBLE] Cox
regressions with different predictors,

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,700
different forms of a predictor in the
model.

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,220
So, when I chose baseline weight, so

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,900
that as I just put w0 in as my predictor
in the model.

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,100
I got a hazard ratio of 2.7.

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,900
When I use the average weight, which
doesn't exist in this data set, but

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,790
I made a new variable average weight and

20
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,040
I just averaged whatever weights they had
available.

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,300
So, add up these four and divide by four
for an example, when I, with that,

22
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,102
that in as a static predictor in my model,
I get a hazard ratio of 1.2.

23
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:15,854
And as I told you before, when I then
model the weight as a time-changing

24
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:19,940
variable, allowing it to change over time,
I got a hazard ratio of 8.8.

25
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,310
But how did I actually, do this,

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,800
how did I actually get a time-changing
predictor to run in SAS?

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm going to show you the code now.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,333
So first of all, if you wanted to use a
time static, a, a non

29
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:36,870
time-changing predictor, like baseline
weight like, w0, that's very easy to code.

30
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,448
You just put the variable in as a
predictor on the model line.

31
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:43,450
If I wanted to put an average weight,
again, average weight doesn't change, so

32
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,600
I would just use the variable average
weight.

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,760
That's easy.

34
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,890
But for a time dependent predictor, it's
slightly more complicated.

35
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,180
So here's what the code looks like that I
used to calculate that

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,880
hazard ratio of 8.8.

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,350
So, I'm putting in, one of the things that
you're allowed to

38
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,580
do in proc phreg in SAS is that you are
allowed to create variables on the fly.

39
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,970
This is really the only way that you could
code time changing predictors.

40
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,430
You're allowed to name a variable that
doesn't exist in the data set.

41
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,750
There's no variable in the data set called
weight.

42
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,324
I'm allowed to just name it on the model
line,

43
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:20,217
as one of the predictors on the model
line, and then define it below.

44
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:22,960
So I'm allowed to just make up variables
on the fly and

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,070
define them of, below, and that's what I
have to do for time changing predictors.

46
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,140
So I made up a variable weight, and then I
defined weight.

47
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,420
And basically I said, this time,

48
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,580
whenever I say time in this code, below
the model line, that means the event time.

49
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,290
So whatever event time we're on, whatever
event time we are on in drawing out

50
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,370
the likelihood, we're going to be
comparing that time to, we're going to be

51
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,940
using if then statements to figure out
which weight we should be using.

52
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,550
So, if the event time is less than three,

53
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,940
then the weight that we want to use the
value we want to use for weight, for

54
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,180
this predictor variable weight, for that
event time, is w0, the base line weight.

55
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,130
because that was the most recent weight,
if we're below 3 months in the study.

56
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,740
If the event time is between 3 and 6
months,

57
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,470
then we can use w3, the weight that was
measured at 3 months.

58
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,640
So now my value for those variable weight
changes, when I'm plugging into

59
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,560
the likelihood function changes, to the
weight measured at 3 months.

60
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,280
And then I do a series of if then
statements,

61
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,860
so if the event happens between 6 and 9,
I'll use the weight from the 6 months,

62
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,740
if the event time is after then or equal
to 9, I use the weight from 9 months.

63
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,060
That's the general set up of a code.

64
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,230
Again, you are going to be, when you put
down time here, you mean the event time.

65
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,260
So let me go into this in just a tiny bit
more detail.

66
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,320
What is SAS actually doing behind the
scenes here?

67
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,410
So what SAS is doing is, whenever you name
a time-dependent variable, what it has to

68
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:53,170
do is it has to create for that variable,
a variable for each event time.

69
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,460
So you can imagine it's basically creating
a temporary data set.

70
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,120
In this case, we had three events, so

71
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,190
the variable weight actually has three
columns, three variables, in the data set.

72
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,160
So weight, there is going to be a weight
at the first event time, 2 months into

73
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,660
the study, a weight at the second event
time which was 8 months into the study and

74
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,940
weight at the third event time which was
10 months into the study.

75
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,990
If we had 10 event times,

76
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,780
there would be 10 columns in this
temporary data set that SAS is creating.

77
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,208
So weight is a multi-column variable.

78
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,940
How does SAS figure out what to put in
each of these columns?

79
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,150
That's where my if and statements come in.

80
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,760
So weight for the first event time.

81
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,940
Remember the first event time here
happened at 2 months into the study.

82
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,430
So when time was 2, what were all the
weights for people?

83
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,710
So SAS goes to the if and statements to
figure that out.

84
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,830
So it says, okay, if the event time was
less than 3, oh, yes.

85
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,496
Check.
The event time was less than 3, so

86
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,790
2 is less than three.

87
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,460
Then I need to use for the val, variable
weight the w0, the baseline weight.

88
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,130
So that's what I filled in here.

89
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,980
All of the baseline weights for all of my
subjects.

90
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,540
SAS then goes to the next event time.

91
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,460
So the next event time occurred at 8
months into the study.

92
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,600
And it goes in through these if then
statements.

93
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,620
Is time less than 3?

94
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,910
No.
Is time between 3 and 6?

95
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,740
No.

96
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,170
Is time between 6 and 9?

97
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,760
Yes.
8 is between 6 and

98
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,818
9, so we're now on this row here.

99
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:20,480
So if ti, the event time is between 6 and
9, then use the value for w6.

100
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,460
So we're going to use the weight that was
measured 6 months into the study, so

101
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,800
that's what I plug into this column.

102
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,350
Some of the people were no longer
available 6 months into the study so

103
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,420
they just have a missing value.

104
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,960
Then the final event happened at 10 months
into the study.

105
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,950
So SAS creates another column here, and
goes to the code.

106
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,290
If time is less than 3, no.

107
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,750
If time is between 3 and 6, no.

108
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,520
If time is between 6 and 9, no.

109
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,440
If time is greater than or equal to 9,
yes.

110
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,510
10 is greater than 9.

111
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,900
So then we use the weight w9.

112
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,870
We, so I filled in, in this column, the
values for the 9 month weight for

113
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,790
those subjects who, who had a 9 month
weight.

114
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,010
So SAS creates this temporary data set, so

115
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,580
that it can use in the likelihood for the
first event time this column, for

116
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,040
the second event time this column, and for
the third event time this column.

117
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,480
That's what SAS is doing behind the scenes
and

118
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,810
that, you're going to kind of need to know
that in order to be able to

119
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,640
think out exactly how to code your time
changing predictors.

120
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,340
You really do have to think it out
carefully.

121
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,190
Just to give you one more example, so I
showed you this example when we

122
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,490
were talking again in the module about
time-dependent predictors,

123
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,920
what those look like in the likelihood
function.

124
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,400
So we have seven subjects numbered 1
through 7,

125
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,760
and the outcome here was time to fracture
the stress fracture.

126
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,950
We have their various times in this study.

127
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,380
Some of the women took oral
contraceptives.

128
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,580
So we have a date which they started a
time in the study which they started oral

129
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,400
contraceptives and which they stopped.

130
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,760
So subject six never started them and
therefore never stopped them.

131
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,350
Subject 2 started oral contraceptives 10
months into the study but

132
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,380
stopped them at 11 months into the study,
and so on.

133
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,110
And I already show you,

134
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,860
showed you what the likelihood would look
like for these data.

135
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,910
But how would I actually enter these data
into SAS, and

136
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:08,190
code tells SAS to model this as a time
changing predictor.

137
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,360
What would the code look like?

138
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,110
So I went ahead for this little, little
data set and wrote out some code.

139
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,100
So our model here is time and our element
here is fracture, so

140
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,330
this zero is the censored value, and I've
created another variable on the fly, so

141
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,080
I'm just noticing in my data set there's
no variable called called onoc.

142
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,320
But I'm making up a new variable which I'm
calling onoc, or on oral contraceptives.

143
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,370
And then I have to define it below.

144
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,290
Again, whenever I say time, I mean the
current event time.

145
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,330
So, if they never started oc, so

146
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,990
if startoc is equal to 0, then they can
never be on oc.

147
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,210
So if they never started oral
contraceptives, I know for

148
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,240
sure that they can't be on them.

149
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,375
So I've decided to just put a code right
out there that says if they never starts

150
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,390
oc's, if that's a missing value, then they
can't be on oc's.

151
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,790
So onoc's equals 0.

152
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,020
They're not on oc's.

153
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,000
Else if, if that's not the case, if they
did start them,

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,290
then the time at which they started oc's
is less than the event time.

155
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,334
So, meaning that they've already started
them.

156
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:11,594
And, there, the time that they ended oc's
is greater than the current event time,

157
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:12,920
then they would be onoc.

158
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,480
So let me give you an example.

159
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,720
If we looked at the woman who fractured at
6 months into the study.

160
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,100
So our time co-event being here at 6
months.

161
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,116
So we're in, thinking about the, sort of
this is the onoc value for

162
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:30,310
time 6, the event time 6.

163
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,406
If you go through the data set, well this
person has never started oc's, so

164
00:08:34,406 --> 00:08:36,667
she gets a value of, of zero for onoc's.

165
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:42,145
The second person subject 2, is not on
oc's at that time, because their

166
00:08:42,145 --> 00:08:48,010
startOC is 10, their stopoc is 11, so if
you look at the code, time now is 6.

167
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,980
You know, their startoc is 10.

168
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,770
Well, 10 is not less than 6, so right away
then, onoc is not going to work at this,

169
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,110
and this condition is not fulfilled.

170
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,700
Then I have if otherwise, if the start is
greater than the 6,

171
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,320
so is startoc greater than 6?

172
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,010
Yes.
If either one of those is true,

173
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,590
then you're not onoc's.

174
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,170
If you haven't started them yet, you can't
be on them.

175
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:14,113
So if I go through the logic here for this
one, then she's going to get a value of 0.

176
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:19,050
The next one, she started at 0 and stopped
at 12, so we go back to the logic here.

177
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,242
So she started oc, so we go here, else if
start oc, so now our time is again,

178
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:30,010
the event time 6 months, she started oc's
at 0 months into the study.

179
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,552
She ended oc's at 12 months into the
study, so

180
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:37,435
0 is less than 6, yes and 12 is greater
than 0, and 12 is greater than 6, sorry.

181
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:40,840
12 is greater than 6, yes, so then she
gets a value of onoc's is equal to 1.

182
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,610
So she'd get a value of 1.

183
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:48,100
And you keep going, so Subject 7, 1 is
clearly less than 6.

184
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,650
And 7 is greater than 6, so she would also
get a value of, of 1 for onoc's.

185
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,200
And this one would get 1, this one would
get 0, and this one would get 1.

186
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,770
So, at event time 6, those would be the
women on oc's.

187
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,810
When we then run this model in SAS, we're
going to get a hazard ratio that

188
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,700
represents when you're actually taking or
have recently taken oral contraceptives,

189
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,950
how much does that protect you against
fracture?

190
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:18,130
