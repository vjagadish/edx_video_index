1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
[BLANK_AUDIO].

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,207
Okay, at this point, we've had an
opportunity to

3
00:00:09,207 --> 00:00:13,746
learn a little bit about the concept
behind medical errors,

4
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:19,590
never event root cause analysis and
corrective action plans.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,079
S at this point, we're actually going to
spend a little time talking about some of

6
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,955
the actual case studies, or

7
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:30,760
scenarios that we have encountered that we
can use as examples of this process.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,792
And some of the lessons learned that were
gleaned from the review of these different

9
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:40,490
events so that hopefully these events will
never occur again in the future.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,240
Let's take a look at this first case.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,280
You probably could imagine it's a usual
heavy OR day.

12
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,600
There's been multiple delays going on.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,228
In this particular case, which was an
elective procedure and

14
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:07,070
originally scheduled to be a first case of
the day at 8 AM was bumped.

15
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,954
Two different other surgical cases had
bumped this elective case.

16
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:20,250
There was a hot belly and a tape back post
operative fem pop bypass bleed out,

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,818
and so they prioritized the procedures in
the operating room and

18
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:29,750
elected to push back this elective
procedure.

19
00:01:30,788 --> 00:01:35,408
basically, by the time the case the other
two cases were cleared,

20
00:01:35,408 --> 00:01:39,030
the you know, was probably closer to 3
o'clock.

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,400
The anesthesia team, the surgical team
were kind of exhausted from the earlier

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:53,410
cases but elected to stay on to get this
case off and get it completed.

23
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,156
The procedure list was pretty anxious to
get the case started.

24
00:01:57,156 --> 00:02:02,114
He had already had gone back to the office
to see a full load of clinic patients and

25
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:06,184
was irritated already by the number of no
shows as well as

26
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:10,390
some cancellations due to it being a
Friday before a long weekend.

27
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:15,990
The patient was minimally sedated.

28
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,630
And groggy in responding to questions from
the nurses, you know,

29
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,019
as part od the pre-procedure processes.

30
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:28,052
The nurse in the, in the pre-procedure
area normally uses the consent form

31
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:32,170
from the clinic, but there were issues of
essentially trying to

32
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,575
find the forms in the electronic medical
record.

33
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:37,000
During the mean time,

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,980
the procedure was pretty confident of the
procedure location.

35
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,980
So, the patient was brought into the
procedure room.

36
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,070
The right side of the patient was prepped
and draped.

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,000
The proceduralist started to do the
procedure and

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,570
realized the pathology was not present.

39
00:02:56,586 --> 00:03:01,490
And that in the moment, realized that the
pathology was in the opposite side.

40
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,769
So this was kind of brought to the
attention by the nurse who was

41
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:12,915
surveying the case who actually looked at
a set of x-rays that were up

42
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:17,729
on the viewing board and noted that the
x-ray was marked for

43
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:22,730
the other side and that's actually where
the pathology was located.

44
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,725
ultimately, the correct side was
anesthetized prepped, draped, and

45
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:32,900
then the rest of the procedure had
proceeded uneventfully.

46
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,183
Now, in the whole scheme of things, you
probably say well,

47
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:40,924
that's a close call near miss.

48
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:46,270
A bad thing almost happened, but when you
think about this as being a situation

49
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,211
where there was a significant process
variation, could the same sort of

50
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:56,476
thing happen if you were dealing with a,
below knew amputation, or

51
00:03:56,476 --> 00:04:02,600
if you're talking about doing a lung
resection or a kidney resection, you know.

52
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,870
Is there a possibility of actually
resecting or

53
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:12,038
removing the wrong organ or the wrong body
part or operating the wrong location.

54
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:13,424
In those situation,

55
00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:19,045
it could significantly create large risk
management issue that you'll probably

56
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:24,630
end up spending a fair amount of your time
trying to adjudicate well after the event.

57
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,950
So what were some of the factors that went
into

58
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,350
this particular case that contributed to
this situation?

59
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:39,886
Well, for starters in this particular
situation, the pre-procedure checklist,

60
00:04:39,886 --> 00:04:47,160
which includes the procedure verification
location verification wasn't performed.

61
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,570
It was done first thing in, in the morning
and somehow paperwork got lost,

62
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,470
patient got, you know, was sitting in the
pre-anesthesia area.

63
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,158
It's a pretty aggravating, frustrating
situation for

64
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:02,810
the patient who's basically been NPL since
the night before.

65
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,500
And so, you know, people kind of
circumvent or short cut things sometimes

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,190
when totally unintended, but this can
actually lead to that bad outcome.

67
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:18,744
Another factor the procedure site, the
location.

68
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:22,507
Part of the Joint Commission of National
Patient Safety goal is

69
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:25,418
to make sure that you do mark your
location site so

70
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:28,613
that everybody who's involved with the
procedure,

71
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:33,583
even the anesthesiologist the nurses, the
OR nurses who has to prep the area,

72
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:38,612
they're, they're pretty clear in terms of
where we're going to be operating.

73
00:05:38,612 --> 00:05:42,967
Now in some cases, you really don't know,
you know, what, you know, what,

74
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,722
what your actual approach is but

75
00:05:44,722 --> 00:05:48,752
even a mark to help, you know, give an
indication of what's being done or

76
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:52,700
where we're going to go can help minimize
those variation processes.

77
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,451
Time outs, the time out is really, really
critical and it's not just a wrote or

78
00:05:58,451 --> 00:06:03,230
a process that actually is just, intended
to generate more work, but

79
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,414
it's really in geared toward making sure
that the entire team involved with

80
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:14,400
the procedure is of the single mindset,
you know, we're all on the same page.

81
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,746
The time out is analogous to a American
football huddle where the team gets

82
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:26,080
together, either offence or defense, and
review what the strategy or the play is.

83
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,730
And then, you know, once everyone knows
what the play is,

84
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,530
you can actually implement or execute
whatever the play is.

85
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,897
Well, the time out is basically the same
thing.

86
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:40,747
it's, it's literally a momentary pause to
make sure that we're operating

87
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:46,777
on the right patient, the right location,
doing the correct procedure,

88
00:06:46,777 --> 00:06:51,371
and that everybody in the procedure area
is on the same page.

89
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:54,920
The next factor, variation in work
process.

90
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,980
As I mentioned earlier in this particular
case,

91
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,040
what normally would have been a first case
of the day,

92
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,344
pretty straightforward, you know, quick
turnaround time, certainly got bumped for

93
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:10,288
a number of different reasons, and also
the fact of the doctor's own

94
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:15,000
workflow process had changed because of
this surgical postponement.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,810
So these variations in work processes are
oftentimes the a huge factor in

96
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,436
contributing to outcome variations, in
that any time you

97
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:27,654
deviate from your standard procedures or
your standard practice or

98
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:32,612
your standard steps that you would
implement, you're setting yourself up for

99
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:36,098
particularly the unusual or variable
outcomes.

100
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:41,820
Production pressure, we all are subject to
production pressure.

101
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:47,590
It doesn't matter whether you've been, you
know, practicing attending for 40 years.

102
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,760
Or you're a new resident.

103
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,904
You know, it doesn't really matter because
there's some sort of

104
00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:58,830
production pressure inevitably involved
with all of these situation.

105
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,590
It could be the need to see more patients,

106
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,830
do more procedures, quicker turn around
time.

107
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,330
Some of these are, are pretty clear and
obvious, you know,

108
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:14,156
especially with initiatives that hospitals
have like patient flow.

109
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:18,636
Some of them are less obvious and, and in
this situation, you know, that you, you

110
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:22,988
don't always think of production pressure,
but the fact that it, you know, in

111
00:08:22,988 --> 00:08:27,724
this case you had a Friday before a long
weekend, people were making plans there's

112
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:32,770
certainly the fact that they're trying to
get the case in before the day's over.

113
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,677
You know, those kind of things are
production pressure that

114
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:39,270
actually generates potential variation in
workflow, work processes.

115
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,650
The next bullet, fatigue and distraction.

116
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,070
There's a fair amount of literature out
there.

117
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:52,570
This talks about how distraction and
fatigue are connected.

118
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,400
Sometime the distraction stands alone,
sometime the fatigue stands alone, but

119
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,880
both of those are factors that often times
leads to people not having the same

120
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,800
focus on addressing whatever their task is
at hand and as a result,

121
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,300
either aren't paying attention or they
shortcut the process or they skip a step.

122
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,760
And as a result, that leads to an outcome
that you do not want to have.

123
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,770
The other factor in the last bullet has to
do with the culture.

124
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,399
And this is really hard to define.

125
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,409
we, we talk about the concept, but

126
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:28,166
the reality is that the culture that we're
talking about is how is the team, that's

127
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:33,262
involved with taking care of the patient
in that moment, actually operating.

128
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:35,836
It's not uncommon that you know,

129
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:40,380
folks when they walk into certain types of
setting from one setting.

130
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,636
Say for example, a clinic setting, and
seeing a lot of patient and

131
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:49,681
then walking into a procedure setting, or
the OR setting or the ICU setting.

132
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:52,873
You know, there's different cultures that
occur because the team

133
00:09:52,873 --> 00:09:54,880
dynamics are totally different.

134
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,570
It's one thing when you're use to working
with everybody on

135
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,560
a consistent regular basis.

136
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,186
And, and the key factor on culture has to
do with the fact,

137
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:08,440
do you set an environment where people are
comfortable about raising issues that may

138
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,590
be pertinent to what's going on with your
particular procedure.

139
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:19,200
What I mean by that, you know, in the
situation of, of this particular case,

140
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,810
you know, it was interesting that the
nurse that was circulating the room

141
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,910
noted that the x-rays were that were up on
the viewing board were,

142
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:35,650
were labeled for the opposite side, and
was able to say, hey, wait a minute.

143
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,273
You know, I think the X-rays are either
wrong, or

144
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:43,210
it looks like we're working on the wrong
part where we got the wrong side ready.

145
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:48,530
In cultures, you know, operating room,
procedure room, ICU ED cultures,

146
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:54,002
if staff is comfortable with the team and
can raise issues without fear of being,

147
00:10:54,002 --> 00:10:59,094
ridiculed, harassed, yelled at, screamed
at, you know, they're going to be

148
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:05,210
more inclined on raising the flag to
prevent a bad thing from happening.

149
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,080
I think we might have said in the past,
you know,

150
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,630
nobody comes into our healthcare systems,
into our hospitals thinking that

151
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,930
morning we're going to intentionally
damage or kill a patient.

152
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,293
And the fact of the matter is is that
everyone is geared to trying to do

153
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:22,948
the right thing and when the right thing
isn't done,

154
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,016
do people feel comfortable raising the
issue and saying hey,

155
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:29,560
wait a minute, are we sure were doing the
right thing for this patient?

156
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,620
Are we doing the right intervention, are
we doing the right treatment or therapy?

157
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,080
And then the next step of course is that
how does the team respond to

158
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,390
that suggestion?

159
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:43,427
So, you know, some of the key things that
we'll talk about later in the program,

160
00:11:43,427 --> 00:11:47,981
is some methodologies that you may want to
consider using when communicating to

161
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:50,603
other members of the team in terms of
issues or

162
00:11:50,603 --> 00:11:54,637
concerns that may arise during the course
of taking care of patient.

163
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:59,125
So some of the lessons learned from this
particular event is that procedures on

164
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:03,334
wrong patient or wrong location truly are
preventable.

165
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:08,517
It's interesting that studies have shown
that at least one one individual,

166
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:13,061
one person on the procedure team aware
that something was incorrect but

167
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:18,280
due to the culture of the procedure team
was afraid to raise the issue.

168
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,310
In an operating room setting, a procedure
team is more than just a surgeon and

169
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:26,092
the assistant surgeon but it also would
include the anesthesiologist,

170
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:31,680
the surgical tech, circulating nurse,
potentially manufacturer representative.

171
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,940
Many of us in the academics medical
centers have trainees in the room.

172
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,200
They may not know a whole lot, but if they
heard or

173
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,980
saw something that they're not sure about,
you know,

174
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,060
they may be the first to recognize
something may be not quite right.

175
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,070
Team dynamics are fairly significant as we
mentioned earlier.

176
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,543
When everyone's on the same page and
thinking the same, and anticipating what

177
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:00,570
the next steps are going to be, the
procedure can pretty much go as expected.

178
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,590
When no one is on the same page, the
result can be quite varied.

179
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,520
So why would a culture on a procedure team
be suboptimal?

180
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,489
Well, I think we've already explained that
this could be due to a number of

181
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:17,764
issues including previous bad experiences.

182
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,604
Many of us, you know, were somewhat
trained in

183
00:13:20,604 --> 00:13:25,361
an environment where sometime part of the
challenge, in terms of enduring your

184
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:29,938
training program is suffering through the
harassments and the abuse.

185
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:34,354
Sometimes, [UNKNOWN] dish out, to toughen
us up,

186
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:41,560
to make us more proficient at what we do
to become better, stronger doctors.

187
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,524
When the reality has shown that this very
same behavior actually do contribute to

188
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:50,904
communication disconnect and people having
fear in that situation and

189
00:13:50,904 --> 00:13:55,430
when people have fear, they're not able to
react or respond as they would

190
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:00,440
normally do in a situation where that is
an underlying theme or underlying tone.

191
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:06,321
The other factors that contribute to the
outcome of a bad culture of a team,

192
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:11,504
you know, is, is things that when, when
folks are not familiar with each other, or

193
00:14:11,504 --> 00:14:15,580
have different communication styles or
methods.

194
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,300
And other factors like distractions are
all things that actually could be

195
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,880
contributing to the culture of the
environment and

196
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,944
some of that is totally unintentional.

197
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:28,991
I like the one surgeon that I've worked
with in the past and

198
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:33,393
part of his pre, pre-procedure briefing is
actually taking a moment and

199
00:14:33,393 --> 00:14:36,588
introducing himself to everybody in the
room and

200
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:40,280
letting people know what we're going to
end up doing as a group.

201
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,120
He actually does that as part of his
pre-procedure huddle in

202
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,928
the room before they actually start
cutting.

203
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:50,881
They actually do that as they're preparing
the prep for the patient so

204
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:54,298
that everybody in the room is aware of
what the game plan is and

205
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:57,112
the surgeon actually sets the tone in
terms of

206
00:14:57,112 --> 00:15:01,735
how things are going to operate so that,
you know, if anything's not quite right,

207
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:06,660
his preference is that, hey, let me know,
you know, so we can address them.

208
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,296
And then we can look at it actually
dealing with that issue as a team so

209
00:15:11,296 --> 00:15:13,830
that there's no surprises.

210
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,650
You want to be really familiar with these
factors.

211
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,336
What you say and what you do can really
influence how your team's going to respond

212
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:27,164
if you're the one that's going to be in
charge or, if you're part of the team and,

213
00:15:27,164 --> 00:15:30,930
you know, a team of individuals taking
care of the patient.

214
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:38,254
Some of the tools that are out there that
you can easily look up and

215
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:42,793
will have available, are things like Dr.
[INAUDIBLE],

216
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:49,780
who developed the WHO, the World Health
Organization surgical checklist.

217
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,600
As a pediatric surgeon, he really believes
in standardized approach to

218
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,510
preventing surgical misadventure.

219
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,591
He actually has a very short little,

220
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:02,400
book that he wrote called the Checklist
Manifesto.

221
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,640
We highly encourage you to get a copy of
it and, and read it.

222
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,516
It is a very, very quick read and pretty
much discussed how he

223
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:16,730
came up with the concept behind the
surgical checklist that he advocates.

224
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,606
The joint commission had developed the
universal protocol for

225
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:25,968
the prevention of wrong patient, wrong
procedure, and wrong site surgeries.

226
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:29,352
The Universal Protocol, as otherwise known
as the UP,

227
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:34,608
consist of three core elements, and there
are some similarities between this and Dr.

228
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:38,358
[INAUDIBLE], WHO surgical checklist.

229
00:16:38,358 --> 00:16:42,606
Number one that there's a pre-procedure
checklist that's used and

230
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:46,782
the elements of the pre-procedure
checklist is up to the hospital to

231
00:16:46,782 --> 00:16:50,750
define what goes into that pre-procedure
checklist.

232
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,368
The marking of procedure site when
applicable, you know,

233
00:16:54,368 --> 00:16:58,790
especially if you're doing with levels or
[UNKNOWN] or digits, you know,

234
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,780
you want to make sure you're working on
the right toe or finger.

235
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,212
But the key thing is the actual marking of
the procedure site so

236
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:10,240
that people clearly knows what are
going to be worked on.

237
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,840
The performance of a time map, immediately
prior to the procedure, that huddle or

238
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,640
that pause right, before you actually say,
put a patient under or

239
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,290
push the medication for moderate sedation
or actually insert or start the incision.

240
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:31,255
So, the intent of that time out, as I
mentioned before is really a quick pause

241
00:17:31,255 --> 00:17:35,098
to make sure that we've got the right
patient doing the right procedure and

242
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:36,867
we're on the right location, and

243
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:40,090
we're of the single mindset that we're all
on the same page.

244
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,568
Some preventive strategy that we encourage
is,

245
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:47,980
you know, is doing a quick huddle to talk
about what's, what is about to be done.

246
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,440
We mentioned that earlier it's like we
don't,

247
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,760
we're not talking about a half an hour,
you know, pre-meet, we're talking about

248
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,070
a few seconds to get together, to make
sure we're talking about the right thing.

249
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,920
That the plan is going to be this and
we're going to be doing that.

250
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,206
Taking responsibility for marking of the
procedure site.

251
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:12,657
The drug commission has, issued some
guidance on this and clearly the,

252
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:18,661
individual, you know, the attending or the
fellow or the surg resident who's going to

253
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:24,112
be involved in the surgical procedure, are
folks that we would encourage and

254
00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:29,720
joint commission requires to be doing the
actual marking of the site.

255
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,040
I recognize that many of you have nurses
that are involved with doing, you know,

256
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,780
assisting with the procedures and

257
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,380
the fact of the matter is is that they are
ultimately not responsible for

258
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,260
doing that procedures, actually the
physician that's involved.

259
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,260
And so the joint commission's expectation
is that the physician involved with

260
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,490
the procedure takes that responsibility.

261
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:55,467
We also suggest that, you know,
participation in the procedural pause or

262
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,750
the time out really means stop for a
moment.

263
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,860
Put everything down.

264
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,270
Don't be, looking at the paperwork.

265
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,950
Why they're doing the time out or

266
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,110
continue with the set up and the, you
know, procedure area.

267
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,220
Or continue draping the patient or being
on the cell phone.

268
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,034
Or the intent of that pause is really
everyone is stop, focus on who is

269
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:24,010
leading the procedure pause or time out
and, you know, be engaged in that process.

270
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:28,924
We will tell you that the federal
government, CMS,

271
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:33,068
state licensing, drug commission,
surveyors and

272
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:37,656
evaluators are actually taking the time to
come into the procedure room or

273
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:42,688
observe through monitors whether or not
everybody around the procedure table or

274
00:19:42,688 --> 00:19:46,610
the procedure, the bed where the
procedures being done,

275
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:51,420
is actually stopped and, you know,
observing what the right patient,

276
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,210
right procedure, right location discussion
is going on.

277
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,410
This procedure pause or

278
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,110
time out, we're not talking about a lot of
time, we're talking about a few minutes.

279
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,910
Or, excuse me, a few seconds.

280
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,840
It's a few seconds.

281
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,870
And then also be aware of the production
pressure, fatigue, and

282
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,730
communication styles that often time comes
up.

283
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,700
Normally if you're alert, you're fresh,
that's one thing.

284
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,730
You know, your mind's engaged, but if you
have had a long hard day or

285
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:23,565
you've been on call all night and he's got
a boatload of work to have to

286
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:28,050
be done the next day, and you've got a
procedure to do, be aware that, you know,

287
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:32,246
these things can be factors in, in terms
of creating adverse outcomes.

288
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:32,746
