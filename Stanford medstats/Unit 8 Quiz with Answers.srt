1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,590
The correct answer here is D.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,287
The correlation coefficient is going to be
somewhere around negative five.

3
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:08,380
How do you know that?

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,726
Well, a lot of these choices are obviously
incorrect so

5
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:15,205
negative one and positive one, clearly all
the dots don't lie on the line.

6
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:19,214
The correlation is also not zero, because
you can see that the line has some slope.

7
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:22,438
And E would be incorrect because you can
see that the line has some amount of

8
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:24,578
modest correlation here.

9
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:28,686
It's certainly not strong but it's
negative, because our slope is negative.

10
00:00:28,686 --> 00:00:32,067
And it's 0.5 here, although as the line is
going down as 0.5,

11
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:35,650
because it's kind of a modest correlation.

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,782
The correct answer here is B, a covariance
of zero indicates no correlation.

13
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:43,483
A covariance is a standardized covariance,

14
00:00:43,483 --> 00:00:48,206
not correlation coefficient, that's why A
is incorrect.

15
00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:51,638
A correlation C is incorrect, because a
correlation coefficient with a highly

16
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:55,330
significant P-value does not necessarily
indicate a strong correlation in terms of

17
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,870
the magnitude of the correlation.

18
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,761
You can have an R of 0.001 that was highly
statistically significant if

19
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,131
your sample size was big enough.

20
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,639
And D is incorrect because it's the
correlation coefficient that's unitless,

21
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:08,115
the covariance has units.

22
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:12,777
So, in this, question we're given an
outcome of cholesterol that's,

23
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:15,750
linear regression equation.

24
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,097
Which has an intercept of 150 plus two
times, our age past, 42 is our slope here.

25
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:27,865
Notice the units are in age past 40, so
you have to be careful about that.

26
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:32,065
If we wanted to get the predicted
cholesterol for a 60 year old his or

27
00:01:32,065 --> 00:01:35,599
her age past at 40 is only 20.

28
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,750
So we would plug 20 in to the model here.

29
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,044
So our yi hat, our predicted value for

30
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:46,589
this person would be 150 plus two times
20, which is equal to 190.

31
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,870
In this question, you have to pick out the
regression equation from the output like I

32
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,710
did in some of the videos.

33
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,180
So what is our model here?

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,556
Our model is that our outcome, our
optimism score,

35
00:02:01,556 --> 00:02:11,112
is equal to the intercepted 77.97, I'm
finding that right here.

36
00:02:11,112 --> 00:02:19,099
Plus our Beta is 0.276 and our exercise is
in units of hours per week.

37
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:23,580
So, which of the following is true?

38
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,320
So, A is actually correct, because it says
a person who exercises 0 hours per week,

39
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,940
is predicted to have an optimism score of
77.97.

40
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,610
Well that's indeed true, you can just plug
in zero here.

41
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,130
This is actually going to go out of the
model.

42
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,940
So that's what an intercept means.

43
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,732
The intercept is the value for

44
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:43,420
which you get at an exercise level if the
x variable is zero.

45
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,050
That's your where it crosses the y axis.

46
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,980
Show 77.97, that would be the correct
answer here.

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,830
B is incorrect, because exercise is not
significantly related to optimism.

48
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,814
Our P value came out to be 0.12.

49
00:02:57,814 --> 00:03:01,178
C is incorrect, because every additional
hour of weekly exercise was

50
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:05,960
associated with with a 0.276 increase in
optimism, not decrease.

51
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,851
Otherwise, it would have a negative sign,
and D is incorrect, because, that is give,

52
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:15,864
the intercept is, is mis, constring/g, the
intercept.

53
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:18,389
The intercept is 77.9, not the slope.

54
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:22,401
So, we're given here that we have a
regression equation cholesterol is

55
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:26,509
equal to 150 is the intercept, two is the
slope.

56
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:28,392
Our units are aged past 40.

57
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:31,980
So if we have 60 year old then we would
say his age past 40 is 20, so

58
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,296
we've plug 20 into the model.

59
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,230
That would give him a predicted value of
yi hat of 190.

60
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,390
This is asking for the residual, so what
is his observed, his actual value?

61
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,440
The residual is your observed value minus
your predicted value.

62
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,259
His, observed value, his actual value is
250.

63
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:53,500
His, predictive value is 190.

64
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:00,510
So he would have a residual of positive
60, which is A.

65
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,410
In this question, we're told that we've
run a model with DSST scores or

66
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,020
outcome variable.

67
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,490
And our first model contains vitamin D and
age as predictors.

68
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,960
The Beta for vitamin D we're given is
0.30, and

69
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,042
we're given the 95% confidence interval,
0.2 to 0.4.

70
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:19,242
Which means we know that it's
statistically significant at

71
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:21,450
the 0.5 level.

72
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,269
We then run another model in which we add
an additional predictor into the model,

73
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:27,400
we add exercise.

74
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,680
The new Beta for vitamin D turns out to be
0.15, and

75
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,750
the confidence interval goes from 0.05 to
0.25.

76
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,054
So, by adding exercise to the model, we
drastically reduced the size of

77
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:43,160
the Beta coefficient, the slope between
vitamin D and DSST.

78
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,380
It was reduced by 50%.

79
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,034
That's an indication that we have
confounding, exercise is a confounder of

80
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:52,700
the relationship between vitamin D and
DSST score.

81
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,520
So, A is correct here.

82
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,620
If you picked B, you got misled by the P
values here.

83
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,190
So we are, we do have a statistically
significant Beta in both cases.

84
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,688
That is, the relationship with vitamin D
doesn't completely disappear when we

85
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:07,430
adjust for exercise.

86
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,010
But we don't look at the P values for
judging confounding.

87
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:15,600
We look at the magnitude of the slope of
the Beta coefficients.

88
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,650
In this question we're given the mean
blood pressure of three groups.

89
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,580
So for the high exercise group it was 120.

90
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,713
For the medium exercise group it was 125.

91
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,370
And for the low exercise group, it was
135.

92
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,505
If I fit a linear regression model where I
don't have anything else in

93
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:36,985
the model other than this categorical
predictor.

94
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:41,606
What's the resulting linear equation,
regression equation going to look like?

95
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:46,298
Well my outcome here is systolic blood
pressure I have to choose something to be

96
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:48,780
my reference group.

97
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,060
I'm going to be dummy coding this
categorical predictor.

98
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,230
Well, which one am I going to choose to be
the reference group?

99
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,282
Well, you could choose any of these to be
the reference group, but

100
00:05:56,282 --> 00:05:59,280
you're limited in your choices in the
multiple choice question.

101
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,950
So, you can see that in most of them, I
picked 120.

102
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,590
The lowest blood pressure with the high
exercise group to be my reference.

103
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,830
So I need this one my reference group,

104
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,360
because it happened to have the lowest
blood pressure.

105
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,530
So the intercept becomes the mean for the
reference group.

106
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,490
then I'm going to have two dummy coded
predictors in my model.

107
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,275
I'm going to have a dummy coded predictor
for

108
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:24,740
if your in the medium excercise group,
versus anybody else.

109
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,955
Their mean is 5 points higher than the
reference group.

110
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,242
So there that data is going to have a
value of five.

111
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:36,024
And we're going to be multiplying that
times one if your a medium exercise,

112
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:38,480
that's how we dummy code.

113
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,622
Then we're going to have to have a dummy
coded predictor in the model for

114
00:06:43,622 --> 00:06:45,750
the low exercise group.

115
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,598
The difference between the low exercise
group and

116
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:50,603
the high exercise group in the mean blood
pressure was 15.

117
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:53,030
So they get an additional 15 for their
blood pressure.

118
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,120
We're going to be multiplying that by one,
if you're in the low group.

119
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,169
Everybody else will get a zero for that
dummy coded variable.

120
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:03,184
So the correct answer here would be D,

121
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:06,810
because only D represents the correct
equation.

122
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,555
This next question, we're given unadjusted
means for

123
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:14,660
three groups, the high, medium and low
exercise groups for blood pressure.

124
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,785
They were 120, 125 and 135, so,

125
00:07:16,785 --> 00:07:22,210
the lowest exercising people have higher
blood pressure.

126
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,400
We then adjusted those data for age.

127
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,057
The adjusted estimates for

128
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:35,490
the mean, then become 115, 125, and 140.

129
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,542
So what we notice is that when you adjust
for

130
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:41,770
age, the disparity between the three
groups actually increases.

131
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,656
It looks like there's an even bigger
difference between especially the high and

132
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:47,660
low exercise groups.

133
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,510
So what does that tell us about the
relationship here with age?

134
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,952
In general I've told you here that blood
pressure will increase with age.

135
00:07:56,952 --> 00:08:00,063
So if blood pressure is increasing with
age and adjusting for

136
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:04,780
age makes our differences between the
groups look even bigger.

137
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,745
Then what we can conclude is that the high
exercise group actually was older on

138
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:11,940
average than the low exercise group.

139
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,660
When we adjusted for age there's actually
a bigger difference here.

140
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,180
In other words if in original sample,
where we didn't adjust for age we saw a 15

141
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,560
point difference between the highest and
the lowest exercise groups.

142
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,229
However, when we adjusted for age, that
went to a 25 point difference.

143
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:30,714
So, what must be happening here,

144
00:08:30,714 --> 00:08:35,204
is that we happen to have some older
people in the high exercise group.

145
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:37,780
Some younger people in the low excersise
group.

146
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,540
And once we adjust for age we're revealing
that the difference in blood pressure

147
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:49,100
between the exercises is even bigger than
we saw when we hadn't adjusted for age.

148
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,150
In this question we are told that we've
got a study were we've got a group of

149
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,363
just 14 women, a sub group.

150
00:08:54,363 --> 00:08:56,911
We've run a linear regression model on
just those 14 women, and

151
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,550
we get this miraculous R squared of 99%.

152
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,710
Well if it looks to good to be true, it
is.

153
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,550
Once you stuff too many predictors in the
model,

154
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,910
especially with a small sample size like
this, you're at high risk of over-fitting.

155
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,084
That high R squared value reflects an
over-fit model.

156
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:16,331
So C is correct here, the model suffers
from over-fitting.
