3
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,240
Hi, I'm Kevin Jenner.

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,350
I'm an anesthesiologist resident at the
Medical College of Wisconsin.

5
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,892
I am here today with Dr. Steven Shafer, a
professor of anesthesiology at

6
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:40,750
Stanford University and the
Editor-in-Chief of Anesthesia & Analgesia.

7
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,010
This session will be about pharmacology
and

8
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,840
how it relates specifically to geriatric
patients.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,850
Thank you for joining me Doctor, Doctor
Schapper.

10
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,350
>> Thank you.

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,510
>> To begin with do you have any general
recommendations as far as dosing and

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,040
administration of medications as it
relates to geriatric patients

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,370
in particular?

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,710
>> Well, first, just to say the obvious.

15
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,660
Elderly people need less drug.

16
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,550
And we can talk and we will talk a little
bit about why that is the case.

17
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,555
That's the general rule.

18
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:09,410
They're going to need less drug.

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,360
The key thing though in terms of assessing
the patient and

20
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,400
figuring out what dose to use is to
establish,

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,740
not just was is the physical age, but what
is the physiologic age of the patient?

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,820
Some elderly patients are, in fact, very,
very robust.

23
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,140
And they would need drug doses similar to
what you or I might need.

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,700
A lot of elderly, though, are on multiple
medications.

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,590
They have multiple comorbidities.

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,490
And these have to be taken into account,
when figuring out what drugs to give.

27
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,640
Additionally because the elderly are
typically on many drugs,

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,140
you have to look for the possibility of
interactions with drugs.

29
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,760
So the elderly patient requires a very
careful pre-operative assessment

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,490
of exactly where they are in terms of
their physiologic age,

31
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,810
not just their physical age, and also of
the many, many drugs that they're on,

32
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,720
what kind of interactions might affect
your dosing.

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,870
Because they are typically on, on multiple
drugs.

34
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,130
So the bottom line is, [LAUGH] they'll
need less.

35
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,840
You can pretty well assume that.

36
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,710
But how much less is really a function of
the polypharmacy,

37
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,610
the comorbidities, and requires very
careful assessment.

38
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,910
>> Okay.

39
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:25,600
Are there some specific causes that, or
changes in geriatric physiology that

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,050
lead to these differences in dosing
requirements for geriatric patients?

41
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,510
>> Well, my perspective is that of a
clinical pharmacologist.

42
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,600
Where I study the drugs,

43
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,170
and I really ask two questions, what is
the end organ sensitivity?

44
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,340
Of course, in anesthesia the end organ is
typically the brain.

45
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,020
And what do the pharmacokinetics look
like?

46
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,120
Pharmacokinetics basically says how high
do the blood levels go for

47
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,420
any given dosage you might give.

48
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,360
And what we see is certain categories of
drugs,

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,540
different behaviors in the elderly
patients for the opioids.

50
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,900
We've shown this for fentanyl, alfentanil,
sufentanil, remifentanil.

51
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,600
The elderly brain is simply more
sensitive.

52
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,540
So for the same concentration of drug in
the plasma or in the brain,

53
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,780
the elderly patient's about 50% more
sensitive.

54
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,770
>> So it'll have a greater effect at a
lower blood concentration?

55
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,410
>> Correct.

56
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,290
So, for example, if you're think about,

57
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,680
well, an elderly patient, I want to start
off with a bolus of fentanyl.

58
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,730
My typical starting bolus is 100
micrograms.

59
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,880
If you have an 85 year old patient,

60
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,440
you ought to start with 50 micrograms, or
maybe even less.

61
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,320
And it's not because the levels are
going to be higher.

62
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,590
It's because their brain is more
sensitive.

63
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,720
Conversely, you look at propofol.

64
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,120
The elderly brain has exactly the same
sensitivity to propofol as yours or mine.

65
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,170
The difference, in the case of propofol,

66
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,430
is that any given dose is a slightly
higher concentration.

67
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,990
The physiology around that relates to
what's called volume of distribution.

68
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,940
And the volume of distribution is
basically what size cup are you

69
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,780
pouring the drug into?

70
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,200
In the case of the elderly the cup's a
little bit smaller,

71
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,460
and when you pour it in your concentration
goes higher.

72
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,360
And that's actually a common physiologic
finding.

73
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,660
That elderly patients have smaller volumes
of distribution and

74
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,830
thus they tend to have slightly higher
levels.

75
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,430
So its those two processes, end organ
sensitivity and the kinetics,

76
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,130
primarily around volume of distribution,
that result in recurring of overdose.

77
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,410
>> Does clearance of medication have an
effect as well on how

78
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,290
the medication should be dosed?

79
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:26,830
>> Absolutely!

80
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,569
Clearance is, is really a fundamental
concept.

81
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,310
However, what's interesting about
clearance is,

82
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,550
where clearance is very important are, is
drugs people take, every single day.

83
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,190
Because their steady state levels, will be
determined by clearance, and

84
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:40,820
only clearance.

85
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,030
Since our drugs are so rarely at steady
state, when we give our drugs,

86
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,250
particularly our induction drugs,

87
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,740
clearance hasn't had much chance to
operate.

88
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,900
Now the clearance of the elderly is
reduced a little bit, but

89
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,352
not that much because hepatic blood flow,
for example, which is very important for

90
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:02,380
[UNKNOWN] clearance, isn't reduced very
much in the elderly.

91
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:08,050
Similarly, cardiac output in the elderly
actually is pretty well preserved.

92
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,620
They have different mechanics as far as
their myocardial function that allows them

93
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,630
to preserve cardiac output.

94
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,690
But by and large cardiac output does not
go down too much in the elderly.

95
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,730
But that gets back to that preoperative
assessment.

96
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,450
You have a patient in heart failure, well,
cardiac output is likely way down.

97
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,180
And they're going to need a substantially
reduced dose,

98
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,850
because of having a having heart failure.

99
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,990
>> Okay.
Are there any you mentioned propofol,

100
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,870
you mentioned opioids.

101
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,890
Are there any other specific drugs that
you would advise caution with

102
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,670
which anesthesiologists use on a day to
day basis?

103
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,800
>> Well, the answer of course, is, is yes.

104
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,680
A drug that I like a lot is ketamine.

105
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,425
And I use a fair amount of ketamine in
patients because I'm a real believer in

106
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:52,220
multi-modal analgesia.

107
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,680
And I like for patients to have as low an
opioid requirement as

108
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,250
possible after surgery.

109
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,290
But I do find in the elderly that you have
to be very judicious with ketamine.

110
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,645
Because the alteration in sensorium that a
younger person or

111
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:07,998
a middle aged person thinks is just kind
of interesting, and

112
00:06:07,998 --> 00:06:12,272
they're very comfortable with for the
elderly there is a possibility of

113
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:16,840
increased confusion and waking up with
said element of post operative delirium.

114
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,769
So for drugs really, it is going to be a
tail of by tail I don't mean T-A-L-E,

115
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:28,320
but T-A-I-L a long tail of drug effect,
actually if you think of it.

116
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,360
I'm very careful with the elderly to try
to not have an altered sensorium at

117
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,350
the time of wake up which is why I like
using propophal which is associated with

118
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:42,950
a very clear headed emergence or a rapidly
dissipating mild anesthetic.

119
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,310
>> Okay.

120
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,186
What is your view of benzodiazepines and

121
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:52,300
their use for preoperative anxiolysis in
geriatric patients?

122
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,506
>> Excellent, excellent question.

123
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:58,690
And my own practices, I don't use them.

124
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,580
Bezodiozapenes have probably the largest
alteration in

125
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,600
sensitivity of any of the drugs that we
use.

126
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,070
A wonderful study by Bell an colleagues in
2009 as I recall.

127
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,730
Looked at the dose of benzodiazepine as
required for endoscopy.

128
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,240
So its not anesthesia per se its for
sedation for endoscopy.

129
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,950
And what they found is that a 40 year old
might need 10 milligrams, and an 80

130
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,530
year old need one and a half milligrams,
and the actual extrapolation was

131
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,635
that by age 95 you were all set for your
endoscopy with no benzodiazepine at all.

132
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:32,280
>> [LAUGH] Okay.

133
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,490
>> So, so the whole point is, there's a,

134
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,620
benzodiazepines are hugely sedating in the
elderly.

135
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,440
A very long tail, to the drug effect.

136
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,870
And that's why I tend not to use them at
all in the elderly.

137
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,070
Usually, my approach to the elderly for
angiolysis is to establish rapport,

138
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,900
and not to use pharmacological means.

139
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,000
>> Okay.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,100
As, as far, you did mention a moment ago
about post-operative delirium.

141
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Which is something that,

142
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,310
that's fairly common amongst geriatric
patients after surgery.

143
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,310
There are other conditions, such as
constipation, GI motility problems.

144
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,500
And problems with possible post-operative
apnea that also in

145
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,910
greater incidents amongst geriatric
patients.

146
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,430
>> Yes.
>> Are there specific drugs that you

147
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,730
would recommend using caution with when
dosing, or

148
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,530
just avoiding altogether in geriatric
patients to avoid those things as well?

149
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,760
>> Well for, for all patients but
particularly for geriatric patients,

150
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,740
I really like to provide as much analgesia
as I can from things other than opioids.

151
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,180
The whole notion of opioids sparing,

152
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,702
the side effects we're talking about,
constipation, respiratory depression,

153
00:08:40,702 --> 00:08:45,770
death [LAUGH] from opioid overdose, these
are opioid side effects.

154
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,910
The difficulty though is nothing relieves
pain as well as opioids do.

155
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:54,770
And so, how can we assist the opioids in
doing that, and that

156
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,670
way reduce the dose of opioids that is, is
required to have a comfortable patient?

157
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,220
So, in the elderly,

158
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,540
I'm very conscious of trying to give other
medications over the course of

159
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,060
the anesthetic, so that when they wake up,
they are as comfortable as possible.

160
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,120
I'm very aggressive with the use of
regional anesthesia in the elderly even if

161
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,260
I have to combine it with a general
anesthetic.

162
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,130
I want the benefits of regional
anesthesia.

163
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,680
Local anesthetics, particularly Lidocaine,

164
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,850
are actually really good
anti-inflammatories.

165
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,340
There's a paper coming out in Anesthesia
and Analgesia that says that

166
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,420
the administration of lidocaine in the
postoperative period,

167
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:33,550
either intravenously or epidural both were
associated with a substantial decrease in

168
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,280
our acute and chronic pain following
surgery, an interesting finding.

169
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,650
So I use lidocaine.

170
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,360
If I have a block that's fine, if I don't
have a block I just give it intravenously.

171
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,270
But I want to have a local anaesthetic on
board in the elderly patients.

172
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,090
I do like ketamine, I hate the doses down
in the elderly.

173
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,180
And I'll try to cover it so we have some
propophol on board.

174
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,900
But I like the use of ketamine for
multimodal analgesia.

175
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,520
I'm going to use ketamine, I might as well
use magnesium.

176
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,610
There have been studies showing that
magnesium and

177
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,000
ketamine actually have synergy at the NMDA
receptor.

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,640
And so, if I use one, I use the, I can use
the other as well.

179
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,410
And essentially, get more NMDA blockage
out of the combination of

180
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,250
the two without really altering the
sensorium as much as if I

181
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,120
were doing the whole thing just with
ketamine.

182
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,470
I also give steroids to the elderly.

183
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,170
A number of studies has

184
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,810
shown that steroids are actually very well
tolerated in single doses.

185
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,470
They don't interfere with wound healing.

186
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,340
They don't increase the rate of infection.

187
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,840
But they are clearly analgesic.

188
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,440
And I'll try to either use gabapentin or

189
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,410
pregabalin for them, if I can add some
acetaminophen, and be careful about of

190
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,440
course because of the concern about liver
injury, but I'll add acetaminophen.

191
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,120
If I can add an NSAID, on an NSAID.

192
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,060
I try to think, what other things can I
bring to the table during the course of

193
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:48,190
the anesthetic to reduce the dose of
opioids in the elderly especially.

194
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,090
That's important for just the reasons you
said.

195
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,885
They're more likely to have respiratory
depression,

196
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:55,800
they're more likely to have LAS, and these
can be very,

197
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,490
very serious complications in the
post-operative period.

198
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,120
>> So it sounds like the only constant
when it comes to geriatric patients is

199
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,050
that there's higher, greater variability
amongst the geriatric population with

200
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,080
respect to their physiology and
pharmacology.

201
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,470
Some geriatric patients are more fragile,
while others are more robust.

202
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,270
Is this right?

203
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,510
>> That's exactly right,

204
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,560
and what you do during the course of the
anesthetic is learn which patient it is.

205
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,390
As I mentioned, you start with your
pre-operative assessment,

206
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,570
which gives you a pretty good idea where
you're going to be.

207
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,710
But just as we approach every other
patient,

208
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,990
every geriatric patient is an experiment.

209
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,880
And your job as the anesthesiologist is to
watch the response to your drugs,

210
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,970
be very quick to make an assessment, are
they responding too much,

211
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,060
just what you expected, or too little and
to adjust in real time.

212
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,415
It's how we practice anesthesia every day
with every other patient,

213
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:43,350
especially in these geriatric patients.

214
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,860
That learning in real time is more
important.

215
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,380
>> As you can see from our discussion
there are several key things to keep in

216
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,100
mind when working with geriatric patients,
specifically relating to pharmacology and

217
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,100
those geriatric patients.

218
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,510
What are some of those key points, Doctor
Shaffer?

219
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,160
>> Well, just to recap what we've just
discussed.

220
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,350
First thing to realize is that elderly
patients are on a spectrum,

221
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,400
from the very healthy elderly.

222
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,860
Where the dosing requirements may not be
very different from you and me.

223
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,112
To the elderly that are very debilitated,
on multiple medications,

224
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:18,077
where the dosing has to be very carefully
given.

225
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:23,333
The one thing you can always say is that
the elderly less drug than people who

226
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,849
are at sort of the middle age of life.

227
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,770
But how much less is very variable.

228
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,900
So the first thing is assessment.

229
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,810
You have to assess the patient very,

230
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,470
very carefully to know where they are on
the spectrum.

231
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,650
The next thing to understand is that there
are different aspects to why

232
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,530
elderly need less drugs.

233
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,910
Some of the elderly are more sensitive
because their brains are more sensitive,

234
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,080
for example, in the case of opioids.

235
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,210
Where the dose needs to be reduced by
about 50%.

236
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,240
However, some of the elderly are more
sensitive to

237
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,530
drugs because their pharmical kinetics are
different.

238
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,260
The drugs reach a higher concentration in
the blood.

239
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,300
That would be the case for propophol, but
it's not that big a reduction.

240
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,300
In the healthy elderly, typically the dose
in propophol is reduced about 20%.

241
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,420
Not that large a number.

242
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,450
The other aspect is that the elderly do
not handle some of

243
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:21,380
the problems that younger people handle,
and specifically drugs like ketamine.

244
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,170
There, there may be a little bit more of a
dis, the tendency for

245
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,210
the elderly patient to have delirium or a
dysphoric reaction to the drug.

246
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,640
So, you have to be very careful using
drugs that alter the CNS in

247
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,680
the sensorium in the elderly patient.

248
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,890
I think those would be the key points for
people to take out of this program.

249
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,036
>> Thank you doctor Shafer.

250
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:46,984
>> A pleasure.
