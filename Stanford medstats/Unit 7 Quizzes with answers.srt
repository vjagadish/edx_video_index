1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,142
So for this question you're comparing two
unrelated independent groups; smokers

2
00:00:05,142 --> 00:00:06,820
and non-smokers.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,140
The outcome is a continuous variable,
cholesterol.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,516
So that's going to lead us in our little
chart of statistical tests,

5
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:14,452
we've got continuous outcome, independent
groups,

6
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:17,850
that's going to lead us to a T-test since
we have two groups.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,534
Now we don't know for sure that
cholesterol is normally distributed, but

8
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:22,074
we have a fairly large sample size here,
so

9
00:00:22,074 --> 00:00:24,980
we're not going to worry too much about
that.

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,308
Then, we also don't know if we have
homogeneity of variances in

11
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:29,332
the two groups, but

12
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:35,850
if we're doing the t-test, we could choose
the un-pooled variants if that's the case.

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,620
In this case, we're comparing two
independent groups.

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,880
Smokers and non-smokers.

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,990
The outcome is continuous cholesterol.

16
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,590
So that's going to lead us to a two-sample
T-test.

17
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,502
However, in this case we clearly have
different variances between

18
00:00:48,502 --> 00:00:49,850
the two groups.

19
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,120
The T-test has a way to deal with that.

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,470
Which is to just choose the un-pooled
variants.

21
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,623
If the variances aren't equal, it's not
really fair to pool them.

22
00:00:57,623 --> 00:01:00,450
We'll just use the unpooled variance and
the standard error.

23
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,238
In this question the correct answer is c,
a parity test because we're

24
00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:12,320
comparing a single group of smokers before
and after they quit smoking.

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,960
So we have a,

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,770
we have two correlated groups that's the
same people before and after.

27
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,320
We have a continuous outcome here which is
cholesterol,

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,960
which is why we would end up at the paired
T-test here.

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,032
We don't know for sure that the change in
cholesterol is a normal distributed

30
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:31,960
outcome, but because we have a fairly
large sample here we can assume that

31
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,736
the central limit theorem will kick in if
we're little off normality.

32
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,008
In this next question,

33
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:43,660
we're told that we have a normally
distributed continuous outcome.

34
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,442
So we know we're going to be on the row
for continuous outcomes here.

35
00:01:46,442 --> 00:01:50,159
But we have to read the question carefully
because even though the data were

36
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,581
measured at three time points, the
question was asking just what do we

37
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:59,059
need to use in order to compare baseline
to the end of the study?

38
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:03,620
So we're only using two time points, so
that would put us on a paired T test.

39
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,960
It's the same people, so we have
correlated data.

40
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,210
It's only two time points, continuous
outcome.

41
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:13,820
So d, a paired T-test would be the correct
answer here.

42
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,602
In this question, we have a continuous
normally distributed outcome and

43
00:02:17,602 --> 00:02:21,136
we're comparing groups over multiple, more
than two time points, so

44
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:26,373
we have a correlation, in that we have a
time series here.

45
00:02:26,373 --> 00:02:28,719
We have a continuous outcome, and many
time periods, so

46
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,810
we're going to be using repeated measures
in ANOVA.

47
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,880
So a repeated measures in ANOVA is correct
here.

48
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,958
The assumptions of one way in ANOVA, are
that the outcome variable is

49
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:44,010
normally distributed, that we have
homogeneity of variances.

50
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,950
That is, that the variance of outcome is
the same in all groups.

51
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,160
And, we're assuming that the observations,
the groups are independent.

52
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,980
So, the correct answer here would be d,
all of the above.

53
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,330
This question is asking, if you run a
randomized control trial of.

54
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,401
For treatment regimens,

55
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:02,563
you compare blood pressures at the end of
the day using a one-way ANOVA, and

56
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:07,090
the p-value is point zero three, so you do
get a significant p-value.

57
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,150
What can you conclude from that?

58
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,654
So what you can conclude is actually c,

59
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:14,755
just that at least one of the treatment
regiments is different from the other.

60
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:15,721
ANOVA is a global test, so

61
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:18,619
it doesn't tell you actually where those
differences lie, it only tells you

62
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:22,280
that there's a difference in at least one
of those groups.

63
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,965
In this question we want to compare
vitamin D levels between three

64
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:29,717
independent groups, we're not sure if our
outcome variable level,

65
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:34,530
vitamin D levels is normally distributed.

66
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,350
What should we do?

67
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,440
Well that's a very simple one right?

68
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,736
If we don't know if it's normally
distributed it's actually easy to

69
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:41,440
run some tests for normality.

70
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,606
So we should do d test oppression for
normality.

71
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,360
In this question,

72
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,960
we have an outcome variable that we know
is not normally distributed.

73
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,100
We also have a small sample size.

74
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,000
We want to compare between multiple
groups.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,880
We're going to have to use a
non-parametric test because of

76
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,640
the violation of normality here.

77
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,315
So the correct non-parametric test is a
Kruskal-Wallis test.

78
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:07,730
A non-parametric ANOVA because we have
three groups.

79
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,570
The term,

80
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:16,865
non-parametric refers to the fact that we
are not estimating any parameters.

81
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:18,360
So d is correct here.

82
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,560
We're just not estimating any parameters
we're only getting p values.

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,380
Non-parametric is often used in the case
when we have non

84
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,680
normally distributed data but its not
synonymous with that.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,770
The non-parametric equivalent to the
paired t test is b the Wilcox and

86
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:41,164
Sine rate test which you can find on our
big statistical chart here.

87
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:44,650
In this situation we have.

88
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,910
Correlated data.

89
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:51,016
All the reviewers are paired so we have a
particular author suggested reviewer

90
00:04:51,016 --> 00:04:57,100
an editor suggested reviewer that are
linked to a single paper.

91
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,055
The unit of observation here is the paper
and not the reviewer.

92
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:05,831
Each paper has two reviewers, those
reviewers are correlated or paired.

93
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:07,052
If you are looking at this [INAUDIBLE],

94
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:09,087
you notice that we have a two by two
table, you might have though oh,

95
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,130
difference in proportions test.

96
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,696
But because of the correlation,

97
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:17,340
we have correlated data instead we have to
use a McNemar's chi-square test.

98
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,200
Which is appropriate when we have
correlated data and a two-by-two table.

99
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,520
In this question, we have paired data.

100
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,631
Each paper is linked to two reviewers, an
author-suggested reviewer and

101
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:31,770
an editor-suggested reviewer.

102
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,920
And the question her is, whether or not
the author-suggested reviewers.

103
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,955
Tended to give more favourable reviews.

104
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:39,419
Because we have paired data,

105
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,140
some of the cells presented here actually
don't matter.

106
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,590
So we don't get any information when both
reviewers gave a favourable review.

107
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,390
That doesn't help us to distinguish
between author-suggested and

108
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,220
editor suggested reviewers.

109
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,684
Similarly, we don't get any,

110
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:58,760
any information when both give, give an
unfavourable review.

111
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,516
So where we get the information is when
there was discordance,

112
00:06:01,516 --> 00:06:03,350
when they didn't agree.

113
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,870
And we can see there was a hundred cases
where they didn't agree.

114
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,944
It was much more likely that the author
suggested reviewer would give

115
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:13,320
a favourable review when there was a
disagreement.

116
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,670
This is going to be analysed by a Mcnemar
chi square test and

117
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,020
will come out to be significant to say the
author suggested reviewer does tend to

118
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,820
be more favourable when there's a
disagreement.

119
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,900
In this question, I have both a
categorical predictor and

120
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,697
a categorical outcome.

121
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:32,411
I've got smoking group and graduate
school, whether or

122
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:34,925
not you went, which is a binary.

123
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:37,421
Outcome because I've got two categorical
predictors and

124
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:40,905
I've got independent groups, the smokers,
ex smokers, and never smokers are not

125
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:45,900
related that's going to lead me on our
little chart to a Chi square test.

126
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,310
So the answer is e Chi square test.

127
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,050
Survival analysis is a set of statistical
techniques that we use when we

128
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,977
have time to event data.

129
00:06:55,977 --> 00:07:01,140
So out of the choices here only c involves
time to event data.

130
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,276
This is where we have a cohort study we
follow women [INAUDIBLE] into find out

131
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:06,383
the time it took for them to develop
breast cancer or

132
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:08,950
not develop breast cancer.

133
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,718
So that only c involves a time to event
outcome.

134
00:07:13,718 --> 00:07:19,700
This question involves interpreting a
Kaplan–Meier survival curve.

135
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,432
So clearly you can see from the curve
there's two groups here.

136
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:25,670
Both of those groups had some fractures.

137
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,497
They had some events so the curve is going
down, so a is not correct.

138
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:33,155
B is also incorrect, because it says that
the probability of fracturing in

139
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:37,610
the previous fracture group over two years
was more than 50%.

140
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,370
And you can see from this graphic, that we
never cross the 50% line.

141
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,980
C is actually the correct answer.

142
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,840
The probability of avoiding a fracture for
at least one year in

143
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,728
the previous fracture group, that's the
dotted line, was approximately 80%.

144
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:55,973
You can see that by just going to about a
year, this is time on the x axis so

145
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:58,860
a year is somewhere around here.

146
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,280
If you scroll up you can see that the
survival probability indeed was

147
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,410
somewhere around 80%.

148
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,027
And actually d is incorrect because the
survival curve is actually,

149
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:13,580
are statistically different in this
picture.

150
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,814
These data came from a twin study, so each
case is somebody with Parkinson's disease

151
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:21,642
and they have a twin who does not have
Parkinson's disease, so we have these case

152
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:28,700
control pairs that are correlated by the
fact that they're within a twin pair.

153
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,618
So we have correlated data here.

154
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:36,170
Our outcome here is binary, you have
Parkinson's disease or you don't.

155
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,669
Our exposure variable, our predictor
variable is whether or

156
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,380
not you've been exposed to various
chemicals.

157
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,280
So, we have essentially categorical data
for both the predictor and

158
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,750
the outcome, but we have this correlation,
so

159
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:53,430
that's going to tell us we're going to
have to do a MacNameir's test.

160
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,155
However, if you look carefully at a lot of
this cells.

161
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:59,990
Remember for a McNamar's test we only care
about the discordant pairs,

162
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,410
which would be these middle two columns.

163
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,720
If you look at all of these columns, a lot
of the columns involve sparse data.

164
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,890
So one or two people only in some of those
cells.

165
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,176
So not only do we have to do a McNamar's
test, but we have to do an exact test to

166
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:18,197
calculate those probabilities exactly,
rather than using a normal

167
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:23,910
approximation to the binomial which is
what a Chi-square normally would do.

168
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,790
So we're going to use a McNamar's exact
test here.

169
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,310
This question asks you specifically about
the probabilities for

170
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,440
PRC, it's asking you to calculate.

171
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,832
The p value for the p,e,r,c chemical
column it might be helpful here to

172
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:46,860
draw a two by two table if that helps you
to,to see the problem.

173
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,724
So we have your either.

174
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:53,804
We have cases, the case is either these
are pair data, so we have cases and

175
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:57,884
controls, so the cases have Parkinson's,
the control is their twin, and

176
00:09:57,884 --> 00:10:02,032
we're analysing things at the level of
pairs, so we have in this case then,

177
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:10,620
what we're looking at here is you were
either exposed to p,e,r,c, or you weren't.

178
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,898
And some other cases both were exposed,
some of they were,

179
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:20,240
both were not exposed, others there was a
discordance.

180
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,220
So it turns out that the majority were not
exposed, so

181
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,250
we had 93 pairs where neither the case nor
the control is exposed.

182
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,530
There weren't any pairs where both case
and control were exposed.

183
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,690
However, we did have a couple of pairs
where there was discordance.

184
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,426
So there were five pairs where the case,
that is the person with Parkinson's

185
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:42,390
[INAUDIBLE] disease, was exposed to this
chemical But the control was not.

186
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,411
And we have one situation, one case where
the opposite was true,

187
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:49,600
the control was exposed to the chemical
but the case was not.

188
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,405
It turns out from McNamar's test the only
thing that's of use,

189
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:57,320
the only information that's informative
for us here is the discordant pair.

190
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,220
So we have six discordant pairs, and null
hypothesis here is

191
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:07,890
that the chemical is not related to
whether or not your case or a control.

192
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,899
So under the null hypothesis we've got six
discordant pairs,

193
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:13,554
if there was no relationship between the
chemical and

194
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:18,930
getting Parkinson's disease this would
follow a binomial distribution.

195
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,234
X would follow a binomial distribution and
the n here is six which is

196
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:26,600
just determined by how many discordant
pairs we ended up with.

197
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,530
The p would be point five under the null
hypothesis.

198
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,244
In other words just think intuitively if
there's no relationship here

199
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:34,972
between the chemical and Parkinson's
disease.

200
00:11:34,972 --> 00:11:37,870
You'd expect [INAUDIBLE] the discordant
pairs to kind of be even about three

201
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,434
where it was the case that was exposed and

202
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:44,300
not the control and three where it was the
control that was exposed and not the case.

203
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,441
Well the question we're really asking here
is how far is a five one split?

204
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:52,190
From what we'd expect under the null which
is a three, three split.

205
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,088
So we're a binomial we're going to have to
because is small numbers we're going to

206
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:58,140
have to calculate that exact binomial
probability.

207
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,658
So we're literally going to go through and

208
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:02,585
calculate the exact binomial probabilities
here.

209
00:12:02,585 --> 00:12:03,875
So what did we actually see?

210
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,589
We saw the case where we ended up with
five discordant pairs where it was

211
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:09,590
the case who had been exposed and not the
control.

212
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:14,006
The binomial probability would just apply
our binomial probability formula here

213
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:16,488
we've got six choose five.

214
00:12:16,488 --> 00:12:17,570
P is point five.

215
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,260
So we do point five raised to the 5th.

216
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,348
And then one minus p is also point five.

217
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:25,230
So we do, point five raised to the first.

218
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,366
But, remember, p values, we have to
calculate the probability of what we saw,

219
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:30,480
and everything more extreme.

220
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,896
So we also have to calculate the
probability that we could have gotten all

221
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:35,900
six discordant pairs.

222
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,660
It was the case that was exposed.

223
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,840
So we do six, two, six point five raised
to the 6th.

224
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,170
We also have to consider, the other tail.

225
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,720
Remember, if we did out all the binomial
probabilities here,

226
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,620
they'd go from zero to six.

227
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,297
We could get something that, excuse my
crude drawing here.

228
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:57,796
But we get something where we have five
and six in one tail, but

229
00:12:57,796 --> 00:13:00,246
we have to consider we want to do a
two-tailed hypothesis, and

230
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:05,185
consider we could have been at, just as
extreme in the other direction.

231
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:07,851
And as we could have ended up with only
zero or one discordant pairs where it

232
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:12,400
was the case that was exposed, so we have
to do a two tailed probability.

233
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,426
You can do that by,um calculating the
other tail which is the probability that x

234
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:18,330
equals one.

235
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,100
And the probability that x equals zero.

236
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,388
It turns out that those are exactly the
same as the ones that you see here, so

237
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:27,470
this one comes out to be point zero, one,
five, six, two,

238
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:34,750
five, this one comes out to be point zero,
nine, three, seven, five.

239
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,664
This one will also be zero point zero,
nine, three, seven, five.

240
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:39,470
It's symmetric.

241
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,610
And this one will be zero point zero,one,
five, six, two, five.

242
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,381
When you add all of those up,

243
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:49,183
you get that the p-value here is point
two, one, eight, seven, five.

244
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:54,090
This is a situation where we have paired
data.

245
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,546
We have repeated measure It's the same
women measured before and

246
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,827
after they've smoked.

247
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:04,010
We have a continuous outcome which is
blood pressure and also heart rate.

248
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,690
And so we're going to be

249
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,270
using a paired T-test here because it's a
before an after with a continuous outcome.

250
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:12,870
The correct answer here is false.

251
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:18,800
You actually cannot calculate the paired
T-test from the data given in the table.

252
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,870
Why is that?

253
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,510
Well, we're given the mean before smoking,
and the mean after smoking, but

254
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,800
remember the paired T-test looks at the
differences for individual women.

255
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,310
And right now we don't know the difference
values for individual women.

256
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,610
We don't know how much each women
individually went up or down.

257
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,670
We would need that information in able to
be able to calculate the paired T-test.

258
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,859
In this case breast feeding although
usually a continous variable has

259
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:47,980
been divided up into categories.

260
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,955
So we're actually comparing groups here.

261
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:54,625
Our predictor variable is a categorical
variable.

262
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:59,250
If we want to look at overweight at 18.

263
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,270
That is also a categorical variable.

264
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,060
It's binary.

265
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,390
You either were overweight at 18, or you
weren't.

266
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,670
So we've got two categorical variables
here.

267
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,210
We've got, more than a two by two table.

268
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,340
So we will be doing a chi square test
here.

269
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,204
In this question, breast feeding is a
categorical variable; we're

270
00:15:16,204 --> 00:15:18,343
comparing groups of men by whether or

271
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:24,810
not they were breast-fed over the
duration, how much they were breast-fed.

272
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,000
Our outcome variable is binary: you're
either obese or you're not obese.

273
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,070
We also do not have sparse data.

274
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,975
So we're going to be using a Chi-square
test.

275
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,735
And because we don't have sparse data,

276
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:40,610
we don't have to worry about the Fischer
exact test or doing an exact test here.

277
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,260
In this case, we're going to be comparing
different groups, so

278
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,652
we're comparing men in different groups of
duration of breast feeding so

279
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:49,920
that's a categorical predictor groups.

280
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,031
They're independent groups our outcome
variable now is BMI,

281
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:55,730
BMI is a continous variable.

282
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,610
We're going to assume that it's normally
distributed or

283
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,210
close enough where such large samples
sizes that we can run an ANOVA test here.

284
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,516
So this question says lets say we do our
Chi square test for obesity and

285
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:10,090
breast feeding, feeding group.

286
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,610
And we get a significant p value.

287
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,560
P is point zero three.

288
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,250
What does that mean?

289
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,849
Well, the Chi-squared test is a global
test, so

290
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,514
it actually doesn't tell us where the
differences lie, it just tells us that at

291
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:22,360
least one of those breastfeeding groups is
different than the others.

292
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,924
And if you actually look at the numbers
here, you know, it goes from 9.6% obese to

293
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:29,380
13.1% to 20.7%, it looks like it's going
up as you get more breastfeeding, and

294
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,375
then it goes down for the really long
breastfeeding group.

295
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,560
So, there's no particular pattern here.

296
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,403
So, all we can conclude is d, that the
percent of obese subjects differs in at

297
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:44,244
least one of those breast feeding
categories.

298
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:48,920
This asks you to calculate the mean change
in exercise duration.

299
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,190
And you can do it just off this graph.

300
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,215
It's nice that they were measured in only
units of zero point five,

301
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:55,340
nothing finer than that.

302
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,116
So, for example, this first person went up
three seconds,

303
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,558
the next person went up point five, this
one was zero point five, one point five,

304
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:02,074
zero, one point five, point five, point
five, one point zero, point five, zero and

305
00:17:02,074 --> 00:17:04,060
point five.

306
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,240
You literally just have to pick those off,
up off of the graph.

307
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,816
Well if you add up all of those numbers,
I'm not going to write it

308
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:18,832
all out here just because it would take
awhile, but if you add up all of

309
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:23,584
those numbers from one to 13 you end up,
and then divide by 13 to

310
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:33,400
calculate the average here you end up with
point seven, seven.

311
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,732
To calculate the standard deviation of
change here,

312
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:39,760
we simply going to take each observation
and subtract it from the mean.

313
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,680
Well, you've already calculated the mean.

314
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,890
To b point seven, seven.
So for example, we take the first person,

315
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,420
subtract and mean square that, then we do
this for the next person.

316
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,400
The next person has a value of point five
subtract from the mean square.

317
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,800
That.
We're going to do that for all thirteen.

318
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,705
I won't write it out completely here.

319
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:58,330
You're then going to divide by n minus one
for

320
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,705
the standard deviation, your divide by n
minus one, so

321
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:09,506
that ends being 13 ,minus one or 12 here,
and then we square root that whole thing.

322
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:14,280
When you calculate that out you get a
value of point eight three.

323
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,416
To calculate the standard error of the
change here we would take the standard

324
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:21,710
deviation for change, which we calculated
already as point eight three.

325
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,286
And divide by the square root of n.

326
00:18:23,286 --> 00:18:27,280
So point eight three divided by the square
root of 13 is point two, three.

327
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,890
That would be our standard error here.

328
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:34,170
To calculate the 95% confidence interval.

329
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,460
We're going to take the observed mean,

330
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,520
which we already calculated to be point
seven, seven.

331
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
We're going to add and subtract our t
value here for

332
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,520
a 99% confidence interval I gave you, as
three point zero five, five.

333
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,904
We're going to multiply that by our
standard error which we

334
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:52,250
calculated already to be point two, three.

335
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,642
When you add that all out you're going to
end up with a confidence interval of

336
00:18:56,642 --> 00:19:01,210
point zero six, seven to one point four,
seven.

337
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,590
The answer to this question is true,

338
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,930
it is statistically significant at the
zero point zero one level.

339
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,420
How do we know that, well we just
calculated the 99% confidence interval.

340
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,620
That confidence interval does not include
the null value which is zero here.

341
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,580
This excludes zero therefore we can be
sure that the p

342
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,680
value is less than point zero one.

343
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,450
The answer to this question is.

344
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,110
False.

345
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,414
We did prove that there is a statistically
significant increase in

346
00:19:28,414 --> 00:19:31,480
the exercise duration of these patients.

347
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,290
However, it's unclear if the camp is
responsible for this change.

348
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,480
They could have all gone up for other
reasons.

349
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,260
We don't have a control group here, so we
can't conclude causality here.

350
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,801
We just know that for some reason they
went up a significant amount.
