1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,670
In this next module, we're going to talk
about probability distributions.

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,460
I'll also call these probability
functions.

3
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,440
So first of all, a probability function,
or a probability distribution It just

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,470
gives the probabilities of all possible
outcomes.

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,010
So last week we calculated the probability
of a particular outcome.

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,960
if you calculate the probability of all
possible outcomes of if somebody

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,805
gives you that, those to you, then you
have a probability distribution.

8
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:37,720
y You can think of it as a mathematical
function.

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,370
A mathematical function that takes the
possible outcomes x and

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,550
maps them to a probability p of x, so

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,800
we could think of this as a mathematical
function that is helpful in some cases.

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,910
The probabilities when you have the full
distribution they have to add up to one.

13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,360
Otherwise you know, if you are mutually
exclusive, exhaustive Outcome.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,090
Their probability have to add up to one.

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,680
So that's thing, one thing you can check,

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,400
that you calculated probabilities
correctly.

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,930
Though if you calculated all of them, they
have to sum up to one.

18
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,150
Now I am going to be talking a little bit
about continuous probability functions,

19
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,160
continuous mathematical functions in this,
this week.

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,090
When you're talking about continuous
probability functions, summing up or

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,340
adding up to 1 actually means integrating.

22
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,790
That is involving a little bit of
calculus.

23
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,810
So I don't want to scare you.

24
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,130
But if you, if you want to see a little
bit of calculus,

25
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,810
I will be providingt hat this week.

26
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,890
If you have never had Calculus before, or
integrals are just going to throw you for

27
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,320
a loop, don't worry about it.

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,260
All we're talking about here is if we have
some kind of mathematical function, so

29
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,260
here's just a continuous mathematical
function.

30
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,420
When I say integrate, all I mean is that
you're calculating,

31
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,425
you're figuring out the exact value for
the area under a curve.

32
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:54,740
So if you could do that, just by,

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,770
kind of, measuring this area under the
curve, you wouldn't need integrals.

34
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,100
But what the integrals do for us is,

35
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,980
they calculate precisely what is this area
under the curve.

36
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,690
So that's all an integral does.

37
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,780
If you don't want to see the integrals,
they're optional, you can just, kind of,

38
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,625
ignore them.

39
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:12,280
But every time you see integral, just
think of area under the curve.

40
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,820
For those of you who have a background in
calculus and

41
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,090
are a little more interested in seeing A
little bit of calculus tied in here.

42
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,520
The reason I'm going to throw up these
integrals here is just so

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,970
you can see precisely how things are
calculated and also to give you

44
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,160
a little bit of an appreciation for what
calculus is useful for.

45
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,620
So, I didn't really appreciate calculus
until I took statistics.

46
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,880
Once I saw how calculus was so

47
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,900
useful in statistics, it gave me this new
found appreciation for calculus.

48
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,000
And my mother is a retired calculus
professor, so

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,180
I grew up with calculus all around me, and

50
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,550
I really didn't appreciate it until I saw
how it was applied to statistics.

51
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,970
So that's why I'm going to throw in just a
little bit of calculus here.

52
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,919
Again, if integrels scare you, just think
area under the curve.

53
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,020
Probability functions can be discrete or
continuous, and discrete,

54
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,840
this is the same distinction we talked
about in the first week of the course, so,

55
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,460
discrete means you can only take on
certain values.

56
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,260
So, these would be things like whole
numbers, counts, you're either dead or

57
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,330
alive, treatment or placebo, you throw in
dice, die, can only be,

58
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,190
the outcomes are only, can be one, two,
three, four, five, and six.

59
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,590
So, can only have discrete values.

60
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,520
That's of course as up close to
continuous.

61
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,620
Continuous variables can take on any value
in a given range.

62
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,800
So any, to say any number between 1 and 6.

63
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,960
You can take on 1.2, 1.235.

64
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,870
So these are the things like blood
pressure,

65
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,380
the instantaneous speed of a car.

66
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,290
So continuous things have an infinite
number of possible values.

67
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,970
For the most part this week, I'm going to
focus on a lot of discreet examples,

68
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,010
because they're easier to deal to with,
they're easier to get your head around.

69
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,840
We can then take, kind of understand it,
using the discrete, examples.

70
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,970
And we can, then kind of generalize,
extend it to the continuous case.

71
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,370
Whenever I'm talking about the continuous
case I"ll be throwing in that little bit

72
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,129
of calculus, little bit of integrals this
week.

73
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,290
But I'll try to focus mostly on

74
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,000
the discrete case because it's easier to
grasp.

75
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,010
So let's just take a simple example.

76
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,680
Here's a discrete probability function.

77
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,310
When you roll a die, there are six
possible outcomes.

78
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,480
So I'm just putting those on the x-axis.

79
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,810
They each correspond.

80
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,030
Each of those outcomes corresponds to a
probability that happens to be

81
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,099
the same for all of them.

82
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:24,620
Just one sixth probability.

83
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,380
So we can draw that out in a graphic.

84
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,095
The Y variable here, variable here is the
probability.

85
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:32,920
So, that's a very simple probability
distribution.

86
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,470
Notice that those probabilities add up to
one.

87
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,110
Right?
One of those things has to happen so

88
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,460
they sum up to one.

89
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,860
So, all your probability distributions
have to add up to one.

90
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,140
We can write those same probabilities in a
table.

91
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,740
So, this week sometimes I'll be giving you
a table that looks like this.

92
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,890
So, you have x.

93
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,670
Those are the possible outcomes.

94
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,610
P of x, those are the,

95
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,330
the, the probabilities that correspond to
each of the possible outcomes.

96
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,040
Another name we call this table, a
probability mass function.

97
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,970
It just shows you how each of the outcomes
maps to a probability.

98
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,880
We call it a probability mass function
cause each outcome has a,

99
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,740
probability mass associated with it.

100
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,960
Notice that they all add up to 1.

101
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,460
So sometimes we talk about the probability
mass function,

102
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,550
that is the probability of any particular
value.

103
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,420
Sometimes we are actually more interested
in the probability of a range of values,

104
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,420
and when we're talking about the
probability of a range of values.

105
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,144
We call that a cumulative distribution
function.

106
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:32,800
And, by convention, cumulative functions
always start with the lowest value and

107
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,430
go to the highest.

108
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,680
So here's that same, example of rolling a
dice,

109
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,030
presented as a cumulative distribution
function.

110
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,330
So now we're not talking about the
probability of getting exactly 1 but

111
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,274
the probability of getting 1 or less.

112
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:48,850
Which is 1/6th, the probability of getting
2 or less is 2/6th, the probability of

113
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,660
getting 3 or less is 3/6th and then all
the way up to the probability of

114
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,510
getting 6 or less is 100% because when you
roll the dice, you have to get 6 or less.

115
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,800
So again, this is just a way to describe
the probability of ranges of values and

116
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,750
by convention we always talk about.

117
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,540
The probability of getting something or
less than that.

118
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,870
The probability is to the left.

119
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,640
So let me just write that same cumulative
distribution function out in a table.

120
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,690
Nothing profound here, again we're just
showing this is the probability of

121
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,220
getting one or less, two or less, three or
less, etc.

122
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,440
We call that a cumulative distribution
function.

123
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,760
This is especially important when you get
to the continuous case, because you're

124
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,295
always talking about ranges of values when
you're doing a continuous function.

125
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:33,650
Here's another example of a simple
probability distribution.

126
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,630
So, last week I showed you these this
information on blood types.

127
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,400
And this is really a probability
distribution,

128
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,430
it's just presented in whole numbers out
of 100, but you can get out of this,

129
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,590
the frequency probability of each of these
different blood types.

130
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,430
There's actually 2 variables here, there's
RH, status as well as blood type.

131
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,380
So we can make this even simpler by
collapsing it down to just

132
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,250
the probability distribution for blood
type.

133
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,230
So 45% of people have O blood type, 40%
have A, 11% have B, 4% have AB.

134
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,400
Notice that those add up to 100%.

135
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,960
You have to be in one of those categories
of blood type.

136
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,640
So that's yet another discrete probability
function.

137
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,160
Let's see how we can actually use these
probability functions.

138
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,140
So here's a little practice problem.

139
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,400
Suppose that in a particular hospital, in
the emergency room of that hospital,

140
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,960
the number of patients seen in any given
hour is represented here by x, and

141
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,710
x can vary.

142
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,020
In one hour it might be nine patients, and
in another hour it might be ten patients.

143
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,632
And let's suppose that somebody has
observed this emergency room for

144
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:41,010
a while and they've figured out the
probability distribution for X and

145
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,510
this is our, obviously an artificial
example because we're saying that there's

146
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,510
always between nine and 13 patients coming
into this emergency room.

147
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,150
I'm making it a simplified example.

148
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,030
So, imagine that somehow it's, it's always
that strict.

149
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,210
But somebody's observed and

150
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,304
they've figured out that 30% of the time
it's 9 patients,

151
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:01,850
30% of the time it's 10 patients, 20% of
the time it's 11, 10% 12 and 10% 13.

152
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,900
And that's the all the possible outcomes.

153
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,290
Notice that those sum up to 1.

154
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:12,450
If we listed out all the outcomes then the
probabilities have to sum up to 1.

155
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,810
So now we can answer some simple questions
based on this.

156
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,450
Probability distribution.

157
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,470
And notice that this is a lot easier than
what we did last week, right?

158
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,250
Where I made you calculate those
probabilities, now I'm just giving them to

159
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,950
you and it's pretty easy to pick the
probabiltiies off the chart.

160
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,270
So for example if I say,

161
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,540
what's the probability that in a given
hour exactly 13 patients arrive?

162
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,950
You'd just look in, in the table.

163
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,360
Well, it's 10%.

164
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,910
You just grab that right out the table.

165
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,640
What's the probability that at least 12
patients arrive?

166
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,060
So now we're talking about a range of
values.

167
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,640
So that's the probability that either 12
or 13 arrive.

168
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,440
So we would just add those two up.

169
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,220
So the probability that at least 12
patients arrive is 20 percent.

170
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,310
What's the probability that at most 11
patients that arrive.

171
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,960
Well at most 11 would be 9 or 10, or 11 so
I add up those probabilties and

172
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,288
that turns out to be 80%.

173
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:05,750
There's 80% chance that at most 11
patients arrive.

174
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,430
And this would be a really useful piece of
information.

175
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,940
For people in an emergency room.

176
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,430
If you were the head of the emergency
room,

177
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,540
you need to know about how many patients
you're expecting to come in,

178
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,910
in any given hour, in order to staff the
emergency room correctly.

179
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,440
So this has practical applications.

180
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,290
Some of the important discrete
distributions that you'll encounter in

181
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,250
medical research are the binomial
distributions.

182
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,150
So these are distributions that are used
in many, many cases.

183
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,010
They are very general.

184
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,175
The one that I just showed are a very
specific case, the binomial, is

185
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:43,380
something that generalizes to any time you
have a binary outcome a yes no outcome.

186
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,050
So whenever you have data that's dead or
alive, treated or

187
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,100
untreated, smoker or non-smoker, that
follows a binomial.

188
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,310
So that binomial distribution which we are
going to talk about.

189
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,940
In a module this week underlines a lot of
the important statistics,

190
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,770
in medical research.

191
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,200
Another important discrete distribution
that comes up in medical research is

192
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,460
the Poisson distribution.

193
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,490
And this is a distribution when you have
things that are counts, so like how many

194
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,950
cases of disease are Occurring in a given
area, those are counts.

195
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,280
Counts follow a Poisson distribution.
