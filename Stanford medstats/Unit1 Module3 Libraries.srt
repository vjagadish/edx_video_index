00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,620
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,910
In this module we're going to talk about
SASS libraries.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,460
SASS has a few default libraries that you
can use.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,140
On the bottom left of the page, you can
see the server list and all the libraries.

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,339
SASS has permanent and temporary
libraries.

6
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:20,490
By default, SASS will automatically store
all of

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,496
your files in a temporary library called
Work.

8
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:27,482
While this may be ideal for playing with
data that does not need to be saved,

9
00:00:27,482 --> 00:00:31,105
remember that these may not be available
for future SASS sessions.

10
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:35,050
The temporary work library is cleared out
when you close SASS.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,060
>> A permanent SASS library is not deleted
at the end of a SASS session.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,820
These libraries remain on your computer
and can be accessed at any time.

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,770
When it comes to permanent SASS libraries,

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,564
it is important that the user has
specified a location so

15
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:52,070
that SASS knows where to store and
eventually find the file.

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,680
>> For most cases,

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,480
we suggest that you save your data into
the temporary work library.

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,820
You have a huge file, which you only want
to import once.

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,480
A homework assignment you want to revisit,
or

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,070
if you want to keep a permanent copy of a
SASS data file,.

21
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,410
You want to set up a permanent library.

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,090
I'm going to show you how to use point and
click to create a library.

23
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,798
Once we have done this, we will find the
code and

24
00:01:12,798 --> 00:01:15,323
then use this code in future SASS
sessions.

25
00:01:15,323 --> 00:01:16,123
Step one.

26
00:01:16,123 --> 00:01:18,451
You're going to want to create a folder on
your desktop, or

27
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:20,594
in your documents that you will want to
use for SASS.

28
00:01:20,594 --> 00:01:25,522
For this class, we've already created a
folder on the desktop called hrp223.

29
00:01:25,522 --> 00:01:33,661
We're going to return to SASS and then
click on Tools, Assign Project library.

30
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:38,560
Here we're going to enter our name,
hrp223, and then next.

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,700
Now we're going to click Browse.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,895
Let's open up the C path and look for
users.

33
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:49,680
[NOISE] Here we will find Rom three.

34
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,440
In your case, you will find your own user
name.

35
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,615
And then look for desktop.

36
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:59,229
Here is the hrp223 folder.

37
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:05,079
We'll click OK and then click Next, Next,
and Finish.

38
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:12,699
[BLANK_AUDIO]

39
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:17,217
Now, you will see that we have our
assigned Project Library hrp223 in

40
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:18,410
our process flow.

41
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:20,840
>> SASS has a useful feature.

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,370
Whenever you use the point and click to
create something in the process flow,

43
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,320
you can always see the code that it
created in the background.

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,210
This is the syntax for creating your own
library in code.

45
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,480
>> Please write down this code.

46
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,560
In the future, you can just open SASS and
paste it into a new program.

47
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,589
This will point to the same folder you
just specified on your computer.

48
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,500
It is important to remember that the
library reference you created is only for

49
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,200
the current SASS session.

50
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,110
Every time you start a new SASS session,

51
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,450
you can use this code to re-assign the
library reference.
