00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,430
Welcome to Week Five.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,280
This week we're going to start our three
week discussion of model building.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,910
I'm going to talk about model building
specifically in the context of

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,460
logistic regression, but most of the
principles that I talk about will also

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,850
apply to other type of regression, such as
linear regression and Cox regression.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,030
This week I'm going to talk about how to
model your predictor, so

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,990
we are going to be talking about the right
hand side of the equation.

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,310
When you have different types of
variables, continuous versus categorical,

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,020
how are you going to actually put them
into your model?

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,290
There's some choices you have to make, so
for continuous variables you

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,180
need to choose what units you're going to
model the continuous variables in.

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,820
Sometimes you may choose to model them in
standard deviation units that's

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,039
something called standardization which
we're going to talk about.

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,290
For every continuous variables you're
going to plot it in a logit plot and

15
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,490
make sure that it's actually linear in the
logit like we talked about last week.

16
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,360
But what happens if some of those
variables are not linear,

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,930
how are you going to transform them before
putting them into the model?

18
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,850
Finally if you have kind of a large set of
predictors, especially if

19
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,610
they're highly correlated, you might want
to do some kind of variable reduction.

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,008
And we're going to talk about a specific
technique this week taught called

21
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:14,960
principal components analysis that does
that.

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,970
If you have categorical variables, you're
most likely going to be dummy coding them,

23
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,930
so I'll review dummy coding.

24
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,780
Sometimes if you have ordered categories,
you actually might treat those variables

25
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,310
as ordinal, which means that they're
going to appear a little bit differently

26
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,830
in the model, and I'll talk about how to
do deal with ordinal variables.

27
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,310
Just a little preview to this week,

28
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,110
we're going to spend quite a bit of time
on principle components analysis.

29
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,020
And one of the places where that turns out
to be pretty useful is when you're

30
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,940
analyzing dietary.

31
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,820
Dietary data.

32
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,630
So if you think about dietary data,

33
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,910
what people often do is to give especially
if you have a large sample of people,

34
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,580
you're going to give them some sort of
questionnaire.

35
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,610
They're going to check off things like how
often do I eat apples?

36
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,480
How often do I eat fish?

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,160
And you end up with a, a larger, or

38
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,490
more variables for all of these different
food types.

39
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,710
How are you going to analyze those data?

40
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,070
Well you're probably not going to want to
put each individual food type into

41
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,800
a regression model.

42
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,750
For one thing there's just going to be so
many variables.

43
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,700
You're going to increase you're type
chances of a type one error if

44
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,400
you just throw them all in the model.

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,020
And secondly, of course, it's really hard
to isolate the effect of

46
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,760
any one particular food, because foods
tend to cluster.

47
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,120
People who eat a lot of hamburgers, for

48
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,870
example, are probably also eating a lot of
French Fries, and a lot of,

49
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,480
soda, just because they're frequenting
fast food joints.

50
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,400
So what principle components analysis
allows you

51
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,330
to do with dietary data is to pick out
patterns of eating.

52
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,540
Food groups that, food types that cluster
together.

53
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,890
And so, you might be able to pick out that
fast food pattern type of

54
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,930
eating using principle components
analysis.

55
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,700
So you're going to reduce the bigger set
of dietary variables about

56
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,070
individual foods into a smaller Smaller
set of pattern.

57
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,130
And the particular study that I'm showing
on this screen is one we're going to

58
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,870
talk about this week and it actually did
that in this study.

59
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,780
They had a large number of women teachers
from California and

60
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,240
they applied principal component analysis
to their dietary data and

61
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,970
came out with five predominant food eating
patterns.

62
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,220
And you can see them listed here,

63
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,700
plant based, high protein high fat, high
carbohydrate, ethnic, and

64
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,020
the the salad and wine diet which I think
is a particularly interesting one,

65
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,250
and then they tried to link women's
scores, every woman will get

66
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:33,930
a score on each dietary pattern saying how
much She follows that pattern.

67
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,780
They linked then those scores to breast
cancer risk.

68
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,410
So that's a particular example of the use
of principal component analysis that we'll

69
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,700
return to later this week.
