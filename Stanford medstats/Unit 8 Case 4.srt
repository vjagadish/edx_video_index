1
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,317
[BLANK_AUDIO].

2
00:00:09,317 --> 00:00:13,013
In this next case study, we had a
situation,

3
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:18,469
where an elderly patient presented to the
emergency department with

4
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:24,189
a history of alcoholism, acute
pancreatitis, atrial fibrillation,

5
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:30,256
degenerate joint disease of the spine and
both lower extremities.

6
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:34,104
History of deep venous thrombosis.

7
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:37,904
Social history included intermittent
homelessness, and

8
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:41,484
has had previous, multiple
hospitalization.

9
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:45,852
He was a individual who in some, in some
respect,

10
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:52,764
probably someone who hasn't done a really
good job of taking care of himself.

11
00:00:52,764 --> 00:00:58,390
The review of the patient's medication
prior to admission

12
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,113
was that the patient was taking warfarin,
mini-dose aspirin,

13
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:10,136
ibuprofen naproxen sodium, and on top of
that, loves garlic.

14
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:16,296
You know, actually he's an individual that
lives in the Gilroy, California area and

15
00:01:16,296 --> 00:01:21,176
has access, I'm not sure if he actually
bought the garlic but, or dug up

16
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:26,566
the garlic, whatever, but apparently,
story out of there, loves garlic.

17
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:29,486
And it was pretty obvious when folks,

18
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:35,100
was in the process of doing the physical
evaluation with this patient.

19
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,171
So, based on that kind of a history, and
those medications, and

20
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:41,655
we gave you the key pieces of information,

21
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:46,210
what do you think this patient presented
to the emergency department with?

22
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:55,230
And, if you said he was having a GI bleed,
you are right on the money.

23
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,050
He actually per, presented with a fairly
significant GI bleed.

24
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:07,800
Now, the patient was actually part of the
same healthcare delivery system.

25
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,530
And, actually was seen by several
different specialties,

26
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,118
had been followed in different clinics,
within the systems.

27
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:22,490
And, all the doctors that were involved
taking care of patients were actually all,

28
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,718
providers in the same health system.

29
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:29,430
This same health system uses a fairly
comprehensive electronic

30
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,902
medical records system that crosses the
entire continuum that addressed or

31
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:38,018
it collected information from both, you
know,

32
00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:43,510
within the emergency department, and also
the inpatient and outpatient setting.

33
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:49,610
So, one of the things about this
particular case is background for you all.

34
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,504
It's like, it's not uncommon for patients
to be mobile, you know, and

35
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:56,336
they're, you know, living within a
particular area,

36
00:02:56,336 --> 00:02:58,970
they move from location to another
location.

37
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,124
They're getting care within a similar
system, and within that system,

38
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:08,082
is able to transmit information from one
location to another location, you know,

39
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:09,940
providing folks have access.

40
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,102
And, the fact of the matter is that the
patient actually was

41
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:22,030
fairly well managed, for each individual,
one of those medical conditions.

42
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,459
Now, what's interesting is that you know,
when it was reviewed,

43
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:32,928
that you know, the warfarin was prescribed
by one specialty.

44
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:38,100
The mini-dose aspirin was prescribed by
the primary care physician.

45
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,770
The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory was
prescribed by two different specialties,

46
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,370
like orthopedics and podiatry.

47
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,212
And then, he went, the patient, on his
own, went out and

48
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:50,790
just had garlic in everything.

49
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,939
Now, the system did collect all this
information, but

50
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:58,892
I think what ended up happening in our
review was that we found that

51
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:04,176
nobody ever looked at the summary of the
patient's medication regiment.

52
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:08,616
I know there's been an attitude or a, a
feeling that, hey, you know,

53
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:14,462
it's like I don't, I'm not involved with
managing that patient's medication so

54
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:18,500
I'm not really going to focus on, on what
those other meds are.

55
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,628
I'm sure they're appropriate.

56
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:24,540
If they're prescribed by a physician, that
physician is matching medication.

57
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,096
But the fact of the matter is, is that in
this situation, no one looked at the list

58
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:34,389
of medication the patient was, was on, in
the process of either adjusting, changing,

59
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,790
or adding medication in this patient's
medication regimen.

60
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,215
So, one of these things, originally, it
wasn't an urgent, emergent situation, but

61
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:45,457
clearly, you know, one of the factors was,

62
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:49,090
was that no one ever looked at the
patient's medication list.

63
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,268
Why they didn't do it?

64
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:52,066
You know, you can, you can look at,

65
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:55,024
you know, the factors that we've talked
about in the past,

66
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:58,890
whether it's fatigue, distraction,
production pressure, or culture.

67
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,594
I mean, the expectation is, is that, well,
someone else is

68
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:05,350
managing that patient's condition and
taking care of the medication.

69
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,050
I'm only worried about taking care of the
patient for

70
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,170
the, a specialist in the area that I'm an
expert in, and

71
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,080
I'm just going to focus on what needs to
be done from my perspective.

72
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,979
So, some of the lessons learned or was
gained from this particular experience was

73
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:24,594
that the Joint Commission has another
National Patients Safety Goal that has

74
00:05:24,594 --> 00:05:28,073
very specific requirements regarding the
collection and

75
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:30,190
use of medication information.

76
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:36,194
There is a requirement of the need to
gather that information upon

77
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:38,730
entry into a healthcare setting.

78
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,660
This is true whether they're coming to the
emergency department,

79
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,800
coming into the outpatient setting,
getting admitted into the hospital.

80
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
You need to gather that information.

81
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,830
And then, this information needs to be
used whenever there's an addition,

82
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,100
a deletion, or modification in that
patient's medication regiment.

83
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,905
That's were the disconnect occurred in
this particular setting because, you know,

84
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:08,130
when I actually reviewed the patients
prior to admission medication lists,

85
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,980
it was pretty clear what they were taking.

86
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,950
And it was pretty clear that they were
taking medication that was designed to be

87
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,009
treating specific conditions or diagnosis.

88
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,972
But, in aggregate, you know, for whatever
reason,

89
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:26,878
no one ever put the big picture together
and said, hey, you know, we may be

90
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:31,825
affecting, significantly affecting this
patient coag status, coagulation status.

91
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:37,132
And as a result, the patient did suffer
from a fairly significant GI bleed.

92
00:06:37,132 --> 00:06:38,794
Now, knock on wood.

93
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:41,794
The good thing out of this is that, you
know, the, between

94
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:45,754
the emergency department, the intensive
care, and the surgical and medical

95
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:50,110
services this organization, you know, they
were able to clear the patient up.

96
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,053
And, the patient was actually able to be
discharged back out to the community.

97
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:59,589
But one of the big lessons learned is that
we have all the information in

98
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,721
the electronic medical records.

99
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,087
Really, really important to be able to
review it and use that

100
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:10,780
information whenever we're involved with
any type of medication management process.

101
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,379
So, the use of that electronic medical
record is a tool that assists in

102
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:18,527
gathering, but then the other side of it
is being able to use that information and

103
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,450
do the right thing for the patient.

104
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,317
The National Patient Safety Goal also
requires that the patient, and or

105
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:27,858
the care providers, and or

106
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:31,960
their family are educated about the
medications that they are taking.

107
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:36,760
One of the lessons learned from this
particular case is

108
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,072
that the patient knew about the blood
thinner, the warfarin, and

109
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:46,462
what the purpose of that was to address
the potential for problems from a,

110
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:51,450
from his AFib, and also the past history
of deep venous thrombosis.

111
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,805
But, for whatever reason, the
communication about the mini-dose aspirin

112
00:07:55,805 --> 00:08:00,079
and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
never really was provided.

113
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,304
The patient wasn't aware that when you add
all these medications together,

114
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:06,450
that it can affect his ability to clot.

115
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:11,490
And then we also deal with the other sided
of this, where if the patient,

116
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,978
if they had been informed of this, and we
do know a patient who says, well, hey,

117
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:19,740
you know, if the the one pill a day works
really, really good,

118
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,327
I wonder if two pills a day is going to
make a bigger difference.

119
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:26,743
And we do know of those situations where
patients, you know,

120
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:29,898
even though they're given very clear-cut
instructions.

121
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:32,324
It's in the pamphlet or literature that
they're given.

122
00:08:32,324 --> 00:08:35,644
It's on the instruction on the medication
bottle.

123
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:39,640
The outpatient pharmacist gives him that
additional instruction.

124
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,121
You know, the different specialists or the
primary care doctors that

125
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:47,390
the patient's seeing, reinforce or
reiterate the medication regimen.

126
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,334
It is not uncommon, we have patients that
ends up doubling or tripling up on their

127
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:56,270
medication, thinking that, you know, if
one is good, two is better, three is best.

128
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,695
So, you know, those kind of things, you,
you, you can't prevent from happening, but

129
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:03,822
you could prevent the fact that they would
even consider that by

130
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:05,640
providing the education.

131
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,552
And that's where the National Patient
Safety Goal kicks in,

132
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:11,912
regarding making sure the patient, their
caregiver, their family,

133
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:15,944
whoever's involved with their care, are
really educated about the medication that

134
00:09:15,944 --> 00:09:18,918
they are taking so that something like
this would not occur.

135
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:19,418
