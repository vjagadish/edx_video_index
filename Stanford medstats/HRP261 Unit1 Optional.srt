1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,000
In this next module I'm going to give a
brief introduction to

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,600
the different types of study designs that
are used in medical research.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,400
This is not a course on study design.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,340
However, I am going to be throwing around
terms like cross-sectional study,

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,080
cohort study, randomized trial.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,990
So it's important that you're familiar
with those terms.

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,810
It's always important to interpret the
data in the context of

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,760
the study design from which it was
collected.

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,590
So studies can be broken down into two
major types,

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,550
observational and experimental.

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,280
Observational studies are studies where
the investigator just

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,580
observes the participants.

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,350
They don't intervene in anyway.

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,740
Experimental studies the investigator
actually intervenes in some way.

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,440
The classic experimental study is the
randomized controlled trial, and

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,950
that's considered the gold standard of
study design.

17
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,450
And for reasons that we're going to talk
about.

18
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,000
But it's not always possible to do an
experimental study, or

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,830
to do a randomized trial, so much of the
medical literature that you're

20
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,980
going to encounter are observational
studies.

21
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,970
So, I'm going to just review the
different,

22
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,230
types of observational studies in this
module.

23
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,860
I'll point out to you that all of these
different study designs provide different

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,910
levels of evidence for the hypothesis
they're testing.

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:22,000
And they generally, the level of evidence
increases as you go down this list.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,770
So when you're talking about descriptive
or cross-sectional studies or case-control

27
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,300
studies, those, as we're going to talk
about, have some potential biases.

28
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,990
And those are going to have a lesser level
of evidence,

29
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,480
than a cohort study which is next on the
list.

30
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,240
And a cohort study generally will have
less Of a level of evidence,

31
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,060
than a well done randomized controlled
trial.

32
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,620
So there's increasing level of evidence as
we go down this list.

33
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,770
The reason that observational studies
have, provide a,

34
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,890
a lower level of evidence for hypothesis,
the reason it's harder to

35
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,250
draw conclusions from them has to do with
a concept called confounding.

36
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,070
And we're going to spend a lot of time
talking about confounding in this course.

37
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,490
So I'm just going to introduce the idea of
confounding now.

38
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:12,200
So, confounding is this idea that risk
factors don't happen in isolation.

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,180
People who smoke also tend to drink and

40
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,190
also tend to do other risky things for
their health.

41
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,815
So if you're just observing participants
in a study, it's very hard to tease out

42
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:28,160
a single risk factor from among the many
risk factors that tend to go together.

43
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,610
So a classic of example of confounding
would be the following, if you went out in

44
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,740
the population and studied alcohol and
lung cancer, if you looked at drinkers and

45
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,240
tried to see whether or not drinking was
related to lung cancer, in fact,

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,940
you would find that people who are heavy
drinkers tend to get more lung cancer.

47
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,620
Those things are correlated.

48
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:53,060
That might lead you to think that alcohol
is somehow causing lung cancer.

49
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,930
Alcohol does, is involved in some cancers.

50
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,530
So that wouldn't be an unreasonable thing
to, to conclude.

51
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,220
However, it turns out that alcohol doesn't
biologically cause lung cancer.

52
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,770
What's going on here is that heavy
drinkers also tend to be heavy smokers.

53
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,330
And of course, we know that smoking is a
major, major cause of lung cancer.

54
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,130
So in this case, the apparent association
between alcohol and

55
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,850
lung cancer is really just due to
confounding by smoking.

56
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:27,070
I'm just going to show you this table here
because it's a really great illustration,

57
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,670
of how risk factors cluster in
observational studies.

58
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,200
So this is a study that we're going to
return to in another couple of weeks, and

59
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,250
we'll talk about in some, in some more
detail,

60
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,420
but I'm just showing you table one for the
men from this study.

61
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,460
And this study was looking at whether or

62
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:49,330
not, how much red meat you eat is
correlated to mortality?

63
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,730
And what the researchers did,

64
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,830
was they just asked people to report how
much red meat they're eating.

65
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,690
And they divided people up into quintiles
of red meat intake.

66
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,900
So Q one is the lowest quintile.

67
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,980
Q five is the highest quintile.

68
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,690
So if you just look at this table.

69
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,530
Obviously, red meat intake increases as
you go across the quintiles.

70
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,050
That's expected because the groups were
defined by red meat intake.

71
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,310
But if you kind of scroll down the table.

72
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,950
The ages and races aren't very different
between the groups.

73
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,500
But if you get down to the modifiable risk
factors for health, things like BMI.

74
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,310
Let's take a careful look at BMI.

75
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,990
So we look at BMI.

76
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,188
In the first quintile of red meat intake,
the lowest red meat eaters.

77
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:32,350
BMI is 25.9.

78
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:39,056
That increases as you go across the
quintiles.

79
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:39,990
26.7, 27.1, 27.6, 28.3.
So

80
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,380
as you become a higher red meat eater,
your BMI tends to go up.

81
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,510
It's not necessarily because of the red
meat eating, it's just there's something

82
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,750
about people who eat a lot of red meat
that tends to also make them heavier.

83
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,280
It's not just BMI though, let's look at
smoking.

84
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,210
So look at current smoking.

85
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,770
Current smoking also increases so

86
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,620
perfectly as you go up across the
quintiles of red meat intake.

87
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,140
So the lowest quintile has very few
current smokers.

88
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,650
The highest quintile has the highest
number of smokers.

89
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,950
So, red meat eaters also tend to be
smokers.

90
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,120
If you look at education, education,

91
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,430
higher education goes down as you go
across the quintiles.

92
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,970
If you look at exercise,

93
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,090
exercise also goes down as you look across
the quintiles.

94
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,350
Calories go up as you look across the
quintiles.

95
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,230
So basically, red meat eaters are doing
everything else wrong too.

96
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,280
They also tend to smoke, to be heavy,
they're not as well educated,

97
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,530
they don't exercise as much, etc.

98
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:41,190
So how do you isolate the effect of red
meat eating on health or mortality?

99
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,550
How do you isolate that one factor from
among all of

100
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,100
these factors that tend to cluster?

101
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,860
It turns out to be a really hard thing to
do.

102
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,630
That's the problem of confounding.

103
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,930
Now we do try to either avoid or control
for confounding in different ways.

104
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,630
So of course, one way to to deal with
confounding is just in the design phase of

105
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,084
the study is to do something like do a
randomized trial.

106
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:10,280
If you randomly assign people to different
interventions, then you're

107
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,850
ensuring that those interventions aren't
related to any other risk factors.

108
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,050
If you could do a study where you randomly
assigned people to eat a lot of

109
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,300
red meat or not Then people with different
characteristics would be equally likely to

110
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,230
get into the red meat eating group or, or
the low red meat eating group.

111
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,768
So you can isolate a factor by randomizing
on it.

112
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:34,560
They also do a few things in the design
phase of the study like matching, so

113
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,690
you might have a case control study, and

114
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,750
we'll talk about case control studies in a
minute here.

115
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,070
Where you have a, a case somebody, say,
who has breast cancer,

116
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,780
a 50-year-old smoking woman who has breast
cancer, you might go out and

117
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,310
find a control for that case who's also a
50-year-old woman who smokes.

118
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,350
So, you're trying to control for
confounding by finding people who

119
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,620
are similar on the, at least the most
important confounders.

120
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,570
Those are things you can do in the design
phase of the study.

121
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,280
This course isn't really about study
design.

122
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,600
So we are going to be talking about the
things that you can do when you

123
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,580
already have the data in hand.

124
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,470
So at the analysis phase of the study, is
there something you can to

125
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,620
statistically to try to tease out
confounding?

126
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,720
And there is.

127
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,640
The way we generally try to tease out
confounding is with

128
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,170
something called multi-variate regression.

129
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,710
So we use a statistical technique to try
to

130
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,230
isolate the effect of red meat eating,
eating.

131
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,510
From BMI, smoking and all of these other
risk factors that cluster.

132
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,440
So there are statistical ways to get at
this.

133
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,390
We call this statistically adjusting for
confounders.

134
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,080
Now, statistical adjustment is certainly
not a panacea,

135
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,690
people give it too much credit as we are
going to talk about in some future weeks.

136
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,990
So there are limitations to it.

137
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,040
Its not, never going to be as good as
doing a randomized trial.

138
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,750
But it, it is a powerful technique and

139
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,580
we are going to to try to use that to get
at isolating various risk factors.

140
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,530
So the first type of observational study
that I want to briefly mention here

141
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,480
is what is called a cross-sectional study.

142
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,600
If you look at the medical literature,

143
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,540
there are a lot of cross-sectional studies
in, in the literature.

144
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,218
That's because they're easy to do.

145
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:12,210
A cross-sectional study just looks at a,

146
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,280
a section of the population at a single
time point, might measure a disease,

147
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,140
an exposure, and try to see whether or not
those things are correlated.

148
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,030
But it's measuring everything at a single
time point.

149
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,450
It's easy to do because it's often done
with a questionnaire or a survey.

150
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,990
It's usually inexpensive, but it has a lot
of limitations.

151
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,480
So, first of all, since you're measuring
everything at the same time point,

152
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,930
you don't even know what came first.

153
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,590
You can't say for

154
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,820
sure that the disease didn't come before
the exposure rather than vice versa.

155
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,678
So it's hard to tease out temporality.

156
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:45,160
Of course, cross-sectional studies also
face confounding.

157
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,680
So there's a limited amount of information
you can get from cross-sectional studies,

158
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,570
yet they're easy to do so you're going to
see a lot of them.

159
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,500
An example of a cross-sectional study from
the literature is a study that was done on

160
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,310
a large cohort of elderly men and women in
Rotterdam.

161
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,960
And what they did was they took this
sample and they looked,

162
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,990
they wanted to know what's the prevalence
of artery blockage and

163
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,030
what's the prevalence of depressive
symptoms.

164
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,020
So they imaged their arteries.

165
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,650
They took a picture to try to figure out
how much blockage was there and

166
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,750
at the same time they also gave them a
questionnaire and

167
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,480
asked about their depressive symptoms.

168
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,280
So they're looking at everything at one
time point and

169
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,740
they just wondered if those two things
correlated.

170
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,100
Now if it turns out that those two things
do correlate, that artery blockage and

171
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,140
depression tend to go together in this
sample.

172
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,580
The researchers would not be able to
conclude that the artery blockage

173
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,250
caused the depression.

174
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,730
Right, it could easily that the
temporality could easily go in the other

175
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,100
direction, that is the depression could
have preceded the artery blockage.

176
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,390
We wouldn't know which way it went.

177
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,020
So, that's a major limitation of
cross-sectional studies.

178
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,150
Another type of observational study design
is called the case-control study.

179
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:57,200
This is a study design that's especially
used when you have a rare disease or

180
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,990
an outbreak situation.

181
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,490
So you're actually going to go out and

182
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,510
find people who have already developed the
disease of interest.

183
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,510
So this works really well.

184
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,670
Imagine if you were trying to just do a
cross-sectional study of something that

185
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,060
was a very rare outcome, or rare disease.

186
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,620
You wouldn't be able to find enough people
if you just randomly sampled in

187
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,540
the population.

188
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,500
So in a case control study, you go out and

189
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,660
actually actively seek people who already
have the disease of interest.

190
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,660
Then you form a case group.

191
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,590
And then you try to find a set of
controls,

192
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,650
people who don't have the disease, and you
try to figure out

193
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:33,190
what's different in the risk factors
between the cases and the controls.

194
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,990
So you're ask, asking retrospectively
about their risk factors and exposures.

195
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,180
So again, it's great for rare diseases
because a lot of times there

196
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,760
may not be any other study design that you
can realistically do for a rare disease.

197
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,890
It's also the only study design that
really works in outbreak situations.

198
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,470
So imagine we've got an outbreak of
salmonella food poisoning, and

199
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,310
you need to find quickly the, the source
of that.

200
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,230
The way that you're going to do that is
you're going to go ask the cases,

201
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,180
the people who came down with the illness,
what they have eaten recently.

202
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,070
And you're going to ask some controls,
people who live in the same area but

203
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,040
didn't get sick, what they've eaten
recently.

204
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,208
And that's how you'll ferret out the
source in that.

205
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,090
Of course, case-control studies have some
major limitations.

206
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,880
So it's actually very tricky to get an
appropriate control group.

207
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,530
Sometimes in choosing the control group,
you accidentally somehow,

208
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,760
systematically choose the control group
differently than the case group,

209
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,810
in some way that has nothing to do, with
the, the disease.

210
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,220
So that you, could cause a spurious
association between a,

211
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,330
an exposure and a disease.

212
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,040
There's also something called recall bias
that

213
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,920
you worry about with case-control studies.

214
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,180
You're asking people about their exposures
and

215
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,160
risk factors after they've already
developed a disease.

216
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,690
That may affect how they remember things.

217
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,010
So cases may remember things differently
than controls.

218
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,200
Of course, case control studies face
confounding, also we don't really know for

219
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,730
sure whether or

220
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,730
not the risk factor preceded the disease
or the disease preceded the risk factor.

221
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,860
Because again, you're measuring things
after the disease has already occurred.

222
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,950
But case-control studies have actually
been very important in history.

223
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,230
And I can point to some examples and

224
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,290
for example, in, the early days of the
AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s,

225
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,340
the early studies that were done, because
that was an outbreak situation,

226
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,390
were all case-control studies, and those
case-control studies were able to quickly

227
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,960
figure out that AIDS was transmitted by
sexual contact or blood products.

228
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,305
And that was before we even knew that this
was a virus.

229
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:31,150
One of the earliest case control studies
in the literature on AIDS was published in

230
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,710
the New England Journal of Medicine in
1982.

231
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,790
And they went out and found cases,

232
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:41,140
people who had, AIDS, and they found some
group of controls to compare them with.

233
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,700
And they found that the cases were much
more likely to have used a particular type

234
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,500
of drug, than the controls.

235
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,410
Now it turns out that that drug actually
wasn't a causative agent in AIDS, so

236
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,250
this is actually an example of
confounding.

237
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,460
But people who use this drug also tended
to be doing the other high

238
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,460
risk behaviors that were associated with
coming down with AIDS.

239
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,180
The next type of study design has some
major advantages over cross sectional and

240
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,130
case control studies.

241
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,210
It's still an observational design, but
it's called a prospective cohort study.

242
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,830
And what you do, is you measure people,

243
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,150
you measure their risk factors and
exposures.

244
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,690
Before they develop diseases or outcomes.

245
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,810
So you're measuring them when you know
that they haven't yet

246
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,540
got the disease of interest, then you're
following them over time.

247
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,510
So this allows you to know for sure that
the exposures or

248
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,210
the risk factors actually preceded the
outcomes or the diseases.

249
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,910
it also allows you, because you're
following people over time,

250
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,800
you can calculate some important measures
of disease frequency like what's the risk

251
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,790
of coming down with a given disease or
what's the rate of of that disease.

252
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,430
How frequently is that disease occurring
in the population?

253
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,990
Another advantage of cohort studies is
sometimes you'll design a cohort study to

254
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,390
look at one outcome, like maybe you want
to look at heart disease.

255
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,460
But then later on you've spent all this
time and collected all this data.

256
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,940
You might piggyback on a, a second
outcome, like, oh,

257
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,500
well, since we've, we've got all this
information on these people,

258
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,990
let's also look at the outcome of heart,
of breast cancer or something like that.

259
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,170
So, a lot of these major cohort studies
have actually ended up piggybacking on

260
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,860
multiple outcomes.

261
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,530
The drawback of prospective cohort studies
is that it's still observational, so

262
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,890
you're still going to deal with
confounding.

263
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,480
And they take a really long time.

264
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,180
If you're waiting for people to come down
with diseases, these things can go on for

265
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,770
decades, so they can be very expansive.

266
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,530
Also, if you're following people for a
long time you may lose a lot of

267
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,590
the participants and that can create some,
some trickiness in interpreting the data.

268
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,800
But a famous example of a cohort study is
the Framingham Heart Study.

269
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,500
This was started in 1948, researchers
enrolled about 5,000 residents of

270
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,580
Framingham Massachusetts in a certain age
bracket and they measured their health and

271
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,390
lifestyle factors.

272
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,090
So, things like their blood pressure,
their weight, how much they exercise.

273
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:50,790
They followed them for

274
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,250
decades after that to see who actually
came down with heart disease.

275
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,940
And it was from this study that we were
able to

276
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,730
learn things like high blood pressure
causes heart disease.

277
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,890
Being too heavy is bad for your heart.

278
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,260
Exercising is good for your heart.

279
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,750
All of those kind of things that we take
for

280
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,660
granted about heart disease now we, we
learned from this study.

281
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,270
And it, actually that study continues
today they're now going on to

282
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,040
track the kids and grandkids from that
original cohort.

283
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,950
Sometimes we do a little bit different
version of a cohort study called

284
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,940
a retrospective cohort study.

285
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,230
It's conceptually very similar to a
prospective cohort study.

286
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:30,050
So the exposures are still measured before
the outcomes.

287
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,770
However with a retrospective cohort study,
what you're doing is going out and

288
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:39,240
looking for databases, in which you
already have data on everything.

289
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,500
So, the data on the exposures in the data
on the outcomes has

290
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,790
already been collected, for some other
purpose.

291
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,600
So, that saves you time, because, you're
not, you're no longer waiting for

292
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,540
the outcomes to occur.

293
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,960
The outcomes have already occured, but
you're going back and

294
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,880
mining some data sources.

295
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,240
That has collected data on the exposure
and

296
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,360
has also collected data on the outcomes.

297
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,970
So, it's clearly going to be cheaper and
faster than prospective studies.

298
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,160
We still have the advantage that we're
going to know because of the timing of

299
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,950
when those databases were set up that the
exposure data were

300
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,380
definitely collected before the outcome
data.

301
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,380
We know that to be the case.

302
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,380
The major limitation here In addition to
the other other limitations of

303
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,120
a prospective cohort study is that because
the data were not collected expressly for

304
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,970
your study, you, you may not the,

305
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,190
the variables that you are interested in
may not exist in the stored data.

306
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,260
Or the data quality may be low.

307
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,640
So there's issues with data quality that
come up because you are just mining some

308
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,850
existing databases or stored data.

309
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,440
But an example of a retrospective cohort
study was a 2012 study in

310
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,430
the British Medical Journal.

311
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,170
And they were asking the question could
they relate

312
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,730
different types of athletics to mortality.

313
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,510
So they searched a sports reference
database.

314
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,460
And that database keeps track of lots of
famous athletes including all

315
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,890
the Olympians.

316
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:04,252
They were able to identify from that
database a cohort of about just under

317
00:17:04,252 --> 00:17:09,700
10,000 athletes who had participated in
the Olympics between 1896 and 1936.

318
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,250
Somebody had put information about all
these athletes in this database.

319
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,300
They used a cutoff.

320
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,680
They wanted to look at only athletes who
were born before 1910 because they

321
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,740
wanted to look at mortality.

322
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,300
So they wanted only athletes who had had
time to die.

323
00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:27,730
And the database also contained the dates
of deaths of most of these athletes.

324
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,950
So they were able to ferret out of this
database,

325
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,680
to compare the mortality rates of athletes
from different types of sports.

326
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,300
So they used all of this data that was
already stored, the outcomes that

327
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,810
has already occurred, but clearly they
knew that the participation in

328
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,560
the Olympics Had preceded the outcomes of,
of, the outcome of death.

329
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,960
A final little twist on the case-control
study that I want to mention,

330
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,140
because you'll see these occasionally,

331
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,770
is something called a nested case-control
study.

332
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,430
So a nested case-control study is a case
control study that

333
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,060
is nested within a prospective cohort
study.

334
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,840
So, you're already doing a prospective
cohort study,

335
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,820
but you've collected something, usually
some kind of biomarker like blood or DNA.

336
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,750
And you want to do some kind of expensive
assay on that blood or DNA.

337
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,690
So maybe you want to do a whole genome
sequence, or something.

338
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,030
Something that's costly enough that you
don't want to do it on every participant

339
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,450
in the cohort, because it would be
prohibitively expensive.

340
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,140
So, what you can do instead is,

341
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,350
do a little case control study from within
that cohort.

342
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,360
So, you, if you, there is a particular
disease you're interested in,

343
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,720
you wait, until enough people in that
cohort develop that disease.

344
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,550
That becomes the case group.

345
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,890
And then, you measure,

346
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,780
you run the expensive assay on everybody
in the case group, and these are samples

347
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,360
that you stored at the beginning of the
study when you had formed the cohort, so

348
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,840
you know that these blood samples were
collected before people got the disease.

349
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,780
But then, rather than measuring everybody
else in the cohort,

350
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,380
running everybody else's blood through
this assay,

351
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:02,000
you will set select just a small subsample
of the cohort controls.

352
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,990
People who did not get the disease, often
they'll,

353
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,920
they'll take, for every case they'll find
one control from the rest of the cohort.

354
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,590
And you'll measure the blood, the, the DNA
of that person, so

355
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,170
that it's an efficient study design.

356
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,870
You don't have to go through and measure
everybody in the cohort when you have so

357
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,150
many more controls in the cohort than you
have cases.

358
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,170
Let me just give you an example of a
nested case control study.

359
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,650
So, there was a study in Zimbabwe that
enrolled 177 pregnant women.

360
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,730
They were all HIV positive at enrollment.

361
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:36,560
And the study followed the women until six
weeks after the birth of the infant.

362
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,350
They identify 29 cases,

363
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,570
these were mothers who had transmitted HIV
to their infants by six weeks postpartum.

364
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,500
So, these 29 women, they're going to, run
the assay of interest, on all 29, and

365
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,600
what they were, wanted to look at was they
had measured blood during pregnancy, and

366
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,740
they wanted to see whether or not the HIV
RNA levels from

367
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:03,740
pregnancy affected whether or not the
mother transmitted HIV to her infant.

368
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,930
So they measured that RNA load test, they
ran that assay on each of the cases.

369
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:13,390
But then they only ran that assay on 29
controls, not the rest of the cohort,

370
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:18,830
the rest of the 148 people in the cohort,
but only on 29 of them.

371
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,840
So for each case, they found a similar
control, somebody who

372
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,920
was similar on things like age, but had
not transmitted HIV to her infant, and

373
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,370
they measured the HIV RNA load from the
blood samples of those 29 women.

374
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:36,200
So they only had to run 58 assays rather
than a 177.

375
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,230
So that's it for observational studies,
moving on to experimental studies,

376
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,950
of course, the gold standard is the
randomized clinical trial.

377
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,830
And the advantage of the randomized trial
is again that you are randomly assigning

378
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,820
people to interventions, which minimizes
confounding.

379
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,690
You are isolating a particular treatment
or drug or intervention.

380
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,660
From all of those other risk factors that
tend to cluster when you let

381
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,330
people decide for themselves.

382
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,150
There's other things you

383
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,760
can do in randomized clinical trials that
help to minimize biases.

384
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,390
So for example, often randomized trials
will be blinded, so

385
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,450
people don't know which intervention
they're on.

386
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,530
Sometimes the investigators will be
blinded, so

387
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,640
even the investigators in their analysis
in the data can't be biased.

388
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,910
Randomized trials are often
placebo-controlled, so

389
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,430
you can subtract out the placebo effect.

390
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,440
So, there's a lot of important information
you can get out of randomized trials.

391
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,150
And, again, it is considered the gold
standard in terms of level of evidence.

392
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,860
The major limitation is that randomized
trials tend to be very expensive.

393
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,800
You can't really run them for very long,
so

394
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,240
you can only look at short-term outcomes.

395
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,750
And it's not always possible even to do a
randomized trial.

396
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,640
It's not always ethical to randomize
people.

397
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,920
So for example, you couldn't really
ethically randomize people to smoke, or

398
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,050
to eat heavy amounts of red meat, or to
drink heavy amounts of alcohol.

399
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:57,190
Finally, randomized trials usually have
pretty strict eligibility criteria and

400
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,080
that leads to the results of the
randomized trial not always being

401
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,280
very generalizable.

402
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,370
That means the that the results might
apply to a very specific subset of

403
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,750
patients, but not to all the patients that
you would care about.

404
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,010
An example of a randomized trial,

405
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,480
is this example that I mentioned in the
teaser and it's an example that

406
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,940
I'm going to keep using to illustrate the
concepts this week.

407
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,750
So this was a double-blind, randomized,
controlled trial.

408
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,680
It was published in the New England
Journal of Medicine in 2000.

409
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,818
And the researchers were comparing what's
called a COX-2 inhibitor,

410
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:29,590
a COX-2 inhibitor named Rofecoxib.

411
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,420
I'm now going to tell you what the actual
brand name of that drug is.

412
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,480
The drug is actually Vioxx.

413
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,840
And if I say that.

414
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,640
The drug is Vioxx.

415
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,120
Some of you will remember, that will
trigger a memory,

416
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,490
that that was in the media, Vioxx was in
the media very heavily in the mid-2000s.

417
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,720
But they were studying Vioxx as a new,
pain treatment for

418
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,330
rheumatoid arthritis, and they were
comparing it with an older pain treatment,

419
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,870
a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory called
naproxen.

420
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,930
And what they were interested in is that
naproxen and

421
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,180
other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories
tend to cause stomach problems.

422
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,250
People get ulcers and stomach bleeding.

423
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,160
They believed that the cox 2 inhibitors,
this new class of pain drugs would be

424
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,040
beneficial because they would reduce the
incidence of things like ulcers and

425
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,010
stomach bleeding So their primary outcome
was to look at these GI events.

426
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,210
They randomly assigned about 8,000
patients with arthritis to receive either

427
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,240
Vioxx or naproxen twice daily.

428
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,010
It was a double blind study so the
patients didn't know what drug they were

429
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,850
on, the investigators didn't know And
again, the primary endpoint

430
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,000
was confirmed upper gastrointestinal
events, such as ulcers and bleeding.

431
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,960
So I'm going to be showing you a lot of
the data from this study in

432
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,210
the next couple of modules.
