1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,880
Now we're ready to do some simple analysis
on the data.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,580
Remember, you have two types of variables
in your dataset.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,580
Continuous variables and categorical
variables.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,070
>> Let's look at the distributions of our
continuous variables first.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,470
We can do this using proc univariate.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,480
As you can see from the code.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,250
We start out with proc univariate and then
specify our data set.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,570
Then using a var statement,

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,550
we can specify the variables that we
want to have in our univariate analysis.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,120
We're going to analyze age, BMI, weight,
and height.

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,640
We then include a histogram statement, so

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,370
they get a histogram for each of these
variables.

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:44,700
As you can see from the output, we still
have age versus BMI by deceit status.

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,760
This is carried over from the previous
graphic.

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,860
That's why you usually want to include G
options, reset equals Alt before and

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,350
after each of your graphics.

17
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,980
Here's the output for the variable age.

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,430
You can see the mean, median, mode,
standard deviation, variance and range.

19
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,930
And a lot of other information, here at
the quantiles,

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,500
here's information about extreme values.

21
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,770
And down here, is a histogram as well as
information on missing values.

22
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,320
We have a similar output for the BMI
variable,

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,760
for the weight variable and for the height
variable.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,860
>> We might also be interested in looking
at these distributions among the subset of

25
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,620
individuals who are diabetic and
individuals who are not diabetic.

26
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,870
We can do this by adding a by statement in
our code.

27
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,230
Under histogram, we write by is diabetic.

28
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,230
This will allow us to have an output that
is stratified by diabetes status.

29
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,700
Let's run this code and see what happens.

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,790
As you can see we now have an error
statement.

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,810
It says the data set, work BMI is not
sorted in ascending sequence.

32
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,230
>> Remember, if you want to use a by
statement,

33
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,620
you first have to sort your data set by
the variable that you want to stratify on.

34
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:05,660
So first, you have to sort our data set by
isdiabetic using proc sort.

35
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,950
Now, if we run it, it will stratify our
data correctly.

36
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,860
As you can see from the output, it will
first give us all the results for

37
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,090
the subset of non diabetics within our
data set.

38
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,420
Here's the information for

39
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:25,520
the age variable amongst those who are
non-diabetic.

40
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,730
Here's the information for

41
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,204
the BMI variable, amongst those who are
non-diabetic.

42
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,070
And same for weight and height.

43
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,270
And then it'll have all the information
for the people who are diabetic.

44
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,670
So here is the age information for

45
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,240
diabetics, BMI, weight and height, as
well.

46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,110
>> Now let's take a look at our
categorical variables gender,

47
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,650
diabetes status, race and smoking.

48
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,010
We also have our new categorical variables
that we made by chopping up age and BMI.

49
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,150
For these categorical variables we can use
proc freq.

50
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,220
Let's take a look at our code.

51
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,440
By now you should be familiar with the
proc freq syntax.

52
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,035
In this case, we made sure to specify that
our data set was the BMI_quartiles.

53
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,470
Underneath, we have our table statement.

54
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,790
Here we list, all of our categorical
variables we want to look at.

55
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,320
Let's run the code and take a look at the
output.

56
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,310
>> Here we can see the one way frequency
tables, for each of these variables.

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,480
As you can see, we have 582 non-diabetics
and 413 diabetics.

58
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,104
It'll also tell us the percentage of ea,
each of these sub-groups.

59
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:34,130
Let's make a contingency tables, so

60
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:39,610
we can see the distribution of these
variables for diabetics and non-diabetics.

61
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,380
>> Remember, if you want to create
multiple contingency tables,

62
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,750
you can use asterisks and parentheses and

63
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,510
include all the values you want to cross
with is diabetic.

64
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,390
This code creates five separate
contingency tables.

65
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,500
Now that we have these contingency tables,
we can run a Chi-squared test to see if

66
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,445
there's an association between alkon
variable and the categorical predictors.

67
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:07,162
>> [SOUND] We can also add additional
options to

68
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:12,280
limit the output, so it's not as
cluttered.

69
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,740
In the output area we can see whether
these Chi-squared tests provided enough

70
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,890
evidence to reject a null hypothesis.

71
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,140
That these variables are independent.

72
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,120
For example, say we believe that there was
a relationship between smoking status

73
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,890
and Diabetes.

74
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,040
Down here we can see the contingency table
for Diabetes versus smoking status.

75
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,610
We can see here that the Chi-square value
has a p-value that's less than 0.001.

76
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:46,590
This means that the alpha equals 0.05
level, we can reject the null hypothesis.

77
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,650
In other words, there's sufficient
evidence to

78
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,690
show that there is an association between
smoking status and diabetic outcome.

79
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,820
>> Let's make some two-by-two contingency
tables and

80
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,480
have Saas calculate some risk ratios.

81
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,560
To do this, we'll create a new program.

82
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,720
Use proc frequency and specifier data set.

83
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,850
And use our table statement to cross,
Isdiabetics with females and

84
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,510
smoking staff.

85
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,300
>> In the options, we specify relrisk,

86
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,600
that tells us we wanted to calculate
relative risk measures.

87
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,690
In the output, we can see that it
calculated Odds Ratios and Risk Ratios.

88
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,450
This will tell us the strength of the
association between these variables.

89
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:34,210
As we can see there is an Odds Ratio of
0.8, for

90
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,210
the association between gender and
diabetic status.
