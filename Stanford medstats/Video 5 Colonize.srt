00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,790
Hi, my name is Sharon Chen and I'm from
Standford University.

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,690
This video is on Establishing Infection.

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,950
Part of our Introduction to Microbiology
module.

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:21,070
After entering the host pathogens must
colonize a specific niche in order to

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,890
establish an infection.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,230
Colonization usually involves avoiding the
host barriers in

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,560
clearance mechanisms that protect us from
invasion.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,640
This stage of the infectious cycle takes
place during the incubation period,

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,990
which is silent and without clinical
symptoms.

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,730
The learning objectives of this video is
to

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,320
describe how pathogens reach a location to
establish an infection.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,240
To explain the different mucosal clearance
mechanisms that pathogens must overcome.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,370
To explain different ways in which
microbial attachment is

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,480
involved in pathogenesis.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,170
To discuss how microbes cross the
epithelial barrier to establish infection.

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,689
And to describe how pathogens invade
cells.

17
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,110
In this video we will discuss how microbes
reach a particular location and

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,650
how attachment, crossing the epithelial
barrier and

19
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,300
invading cells are involved in
establishing infection.

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,880
We will give you examples from bacterial,
viral, fungal and parasitic infections.

21
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,110
Once a microbe has entered a host, it
needs to reach its preferred location.

22
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,760
This may involve active motility and
sensing by the microbe.

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,960
In the case of bacteria, there are
multiple mechanisms of directed movement.

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,520
The most prominent is Flagellar motility,
coupled to Chemotaxis.

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,119
Flagella are appendages that propel the
bacteria as they swim.

26
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:52,300
In this movie, the bacteria swim randomly
until a needle releases an attractant.

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,810
Their ability to respond and concentrate
at the source is called Chemotaxis.

28
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,990
This microbe is Helicobacter Pylori, a
bacterium that

29
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,310
colonizes the human stomach and uses this
ability to avoid being killed by acid and

30
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,259
to reach the surface of the stomach
epithelium, it's preferred location.

31
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,090
In contrast to bacteria, neither viruses
nor

32
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,810
pathogenic fungi can move on their own.

33
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,270
Yet, they are very efficient pathogens.

34
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,570
Virus and fungi can reach their prefered
sites of infection by

35
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,840
random diffusion called Brownian motion.

36
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,560
And by the flow of body fluids.

37
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,770
In addition, although they cannot move,

38
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,765
fungi can extend their reach by growing
Hyphai.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,620
Parasites refer to both single-celled
protozoa,

40
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,530
as well as multi-cellular organisms, each
with distinct types of motility.

41
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,620
Some protozoa move using specialized
appendages called Cilia.

42
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,210
Other, like amoeba, crawl by extending
pseudopodia.

43
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,020
Still others use gliding motility.

44
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,730
In this video,

45
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,070
you can see a stage of the protozoa that
causes malaria gliding over a surface.

46
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,270
This is a stage that the mosquito injects
into the skin.

47
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,370
The parasite uses this movement to enter
blood or lymph vessel.

48
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,925
To glide over the surface of endothelial
cells, and eventually,

49
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,790
to reach liver cells and invade.

50
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,580
Helminths and arthropods use muscles to
move.

51
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,420
Here, you can see a free swimming
schistosome cercaria.

52
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,620
Trying to penetrate the skin.

53
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,630
It's first uses its tail to reach the
skin,

54
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,200
and then loses it as it penetrates the
epidermis.

55
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,460
It then crawls into deeper tissues.

56
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,750
Eventually, it will travel through the
body and

57
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,730
establish an infection in the liver.

58
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,800
Colonization also involves microbes
surviving very harsh environments.

59
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,150
The mucosal surface is equipped with
numerous mechanisms to clear microbes.

60
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,040
These include mucus, which traps microbes,
cilia in our airways,

61
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,330
which pushes mucus and trapped microbes
outward.

62
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,840
In the gastrointestinal tract,

63
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,450
microbes also need to overcome the
peristalsis that transports contents out.

64
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,740
Our bodies produce numerous microbocidal
chemicals.

65
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,140
The human stomach is a vat of acid that
can reach a PH of one and

66
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,200
destroy most microbes.

67
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,230
This is followed by a shower of bial in
the duatamin that functions as

68
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:23,730
a detergent stripping membranes off of
organisms and off of viruses.

69
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,020
Finally, there are specialized molecules
secreted to injure microbes,

70
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,850
such as Antimicrobial peptides that poke
holes in bacteria, Lysozyme that

71
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:39,139
digest the cell wall, and Antibodies that
specifically bind to microbial structures.

72
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,310
Once they reach their prefered location,

73
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,610
microbes have multiple mechanisms to
attach and avoid clearance.

74
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,070
Attachment is so important for

75
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,160
pathogens that they have molecules and
appendages for this purpose.

76
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,890
Attachment is often essential for

77
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,820
disease and thus they are considered
virulence factors.

78
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,650
For example, E, coli is a commensal
colonizing our large intestine.

79
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,210
Some strains have evolved pili that can
attach to the surface of

80
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,100
cells lining the urinary bladder.

81
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,950
The strains that have these pili are
responsible for

82
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,420
most urinary tract infections.

83
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,130
Other bacteria use surface molecules as
adhesins rather than pili.

84
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,120
For example, the agent that causes
whooping cough,

85
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,160
is a bacterium that can directly attach to
cilia in our airwaves,

86
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,330
the same structures that would clear most
other microbes.

87
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,710
Attachment is not just important for

88
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:43,060
bacteria, for viruses it often determines
which cells they can invade.

89
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,750
Viral infection of specific cell types is
called Viral tropism.

90
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,800
This is often determined by the specific
attachment of

91
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,980
viral surface molecules to host-cell
receptors.

92
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,150
Only cells that express the receptors can
be infected.

93
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,390
An important example of this is Influenza.

94
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,300
A virus that infects our airway epithelial
cells by

95
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,540
binding to cialic acid residues on
[UNKNOWN] proteins.

96
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,050
This interaction is so specific that
variations in the cialic acid arrangement.

97
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,580
Determines which spices of animal and
influenza virus can affect.

98
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,150
Avian influenza viruses cannot easily
infect humans.

99
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,770
During establishment of an infection,
attachment can occur between microbes and

100
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,680
the host.

101
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,630
But, also between each other, and even to
foreign material.

102
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,270
Some bacteria can secrete myocyte
compounds that glue them together,

103
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,240
forming biofilms.

104
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,260
These can grow on catheters and prosthetic
devices.

105
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,690
Biofilms allow bacteria to hide from the
immune system and from antibiotics.

106
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,730
Making these infections hard to treat and

107
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,210
many times requiring removal of the
device.

108
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,500
Catheters are also an example of a way in
which microbes can

109
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,670
penetrate the epithelial barrier to
establish invasive infection.

110
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,930
Breakdown of the epithelial barrier is a
common theme in

111
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,000
the establishment of infection.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,570
In addition to catheter, others skin
defects, such as burns and

113
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,660
wounds can predisposed to infection.

114
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,410
Patients with recurrent infections may
have breakdown of their

115
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,390
epithelial barriers due to anatomic
defects.

116
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:26,820
For example, epithelial injury and
inflammation can cause a formation of

117
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,770
a fistulous connection between the colon
and the urinary bladder.

118
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,560
This can lead to recurrent and difficult
to treat urinary tract infections.

119
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:39,730
Breakdown over the epithelial barrier can
also be caused by drugs such as

120
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,670
chemotheraputic agents used to treat
cancer.

121
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,680
It predisposed patients to bloodstream
infections with their

122
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,350
own microbial colonizer.

123
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:53,030
Some microbes are able to cross intact
epithelial barriers,

124
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,470
to establish an invasive infection.

125
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,220
One mechanism is to invade specialized
cells of the immune system, whose job is

126
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:06,070
to transiently open the epithelial
junctions to survey and sample the mucosa.

127
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,170
Dendritic Cells, for

128
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:12,000
instance, can sample the mucosa by
extending thin cellular processes.

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,740
Between the intercellular junctions of the
epithelium.

130
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:21,300
Some pathogens like HIV, [INAUDIBLE] this
process by invading the dendritic cells

131
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,880
and then spreading to other cells once
they are brought across the epithelium.

132
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,978
This is thought to be how HIV first
processed some

133
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:31,080
mucosal epithelial surfaces.

134
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,570
Without the need for a wound.

135
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,280
There are other specialized mucosal
epithelial cells that survey and

136
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,600
sample the contents of the intestine.

137
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
They are called M cells, microfold cells.

138
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,050
Found on the surface of the Peyer's
patches in the intestine.

139
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,460
Several bacterial pathogens like
Salmonella can invade

140
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,900
the epithelium through M cells and thus
cross the epithelial layer.

141
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,250
Like Salmonella.

142
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,520
Many pathogens invade cells as a way to
establish an infection.

143
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,860
This is true of all viruses since they
required the host so

144
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,020
machinery for replication.

145
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,680
There are several ways to invade cells for
intercellular growth.

146
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,720
Some, bacteria like tuberculosis infect
macrophages through phagocytosis and

147
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,310
then survive inside the phago zone.

148
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,850
Viruses mostly enter through endocytosis
and then invade the cytosol.

149
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:28,480
Parasites like plasmodium and
toxoplasmosis as seen in this video.

150
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,570
Use a sophisticated mechanism of active
invasion to

151
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,780
squeeze themselves into host cells.

152
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,580
Remember though that invasion is just one
pathogenic strategy.

153
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,182
In other pathogens, for

154
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:45,068
example Bordetella pertussis, the bacteria
that causes whooping cough,

155
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:49,739
stay on the epithelial surface and do not
invade cells to cause disease.

156
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:54,699
[BLANK_AUDIO]
