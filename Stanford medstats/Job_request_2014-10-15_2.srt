00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,630
Hi my name is Sharon Chen and

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,600
this video is about the lower viral
respiratory tract infections.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,250
The learning objectives are to recognize
the clinical characteristics of

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,290
Bronchitis and Bronchiolitis.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,420
To describe how the clinical
characteristics of Bronchiolitis.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,290
Relate to the pathogenesis of RSV
infection.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,660
To discuss potential complications,
management and

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,180
prevention strategies for RSV induced
Bronchiolitis, and

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,730
to compare the clinical manifestations of
RSV to that of human metapneumovirus.

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,960
Here is the pathogen list for our course,
and in this video and the entire module,

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,179
I will be discussing these viruses that
cause respiratory infections.

12
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,780
We're going to use the same anatomic
framework and

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,270
focus on Bronchitis and Bronchiolitis.

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,500
Influenza can cause both, but influenza is
such an important respiratory virus

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,670
that we will be discussing in, this in
depth in a separate module.

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,410
We already talked about
Laryngotracheo-bronchitis in

17
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,490
the upper viral respiratory tract
infection video.

18
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,710
So now we're going to continue down the
airway to discuss

19
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,220
Bronchitis and Bronchiolitis.

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,520
The clinical symptoms of Bronchitis really
center on cough.

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,490
It's a productive cough and can last for
several weeks.

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,870
The cough is due to attempts of clearing
the secretions caused by inflammation of

23
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,090
the mucus membrane of the bronchi.

24
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,010
Sometimes the secretions in speed-um can
appear virulent, but

25
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,530
this does not mean that the patient has a
bacterial infection.

26
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,510
The perelence is from sluffing cells mixed
with mucus.

27
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,720
In this case because it is not a bacterial
infection,

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,460
you do not need to give the patient
antibiotics.

29
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,030
In fact Bronchitis is one of the leading
diagnoses of inappropriate antibiotic use.

30
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,120
Bronchitis is predominantly a viral
infection, and

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,520
most of the respiratory viruses that we've
been discussing can cause it.

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,250
Only a few bacteria can cause bronchitis.

33
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,810
Inflammation of the Bronchi can cause
Bronco spasms so

34
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,380
wheezing can be heard in these patients.

35
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,000
However fever and systemic symptoms are
unusual.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,320
And, if you see these in your patient,

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,790
another diagnosis should be thought about
including influenza and pneumonia.

38
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,220
Now, we're going to discuss Bronchiolitis.

39
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,480
This is the inflammation of

40
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,580
the Bronchioles that are narrower than
bronchi.

41
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,350
Any of the viruses that we have discussed
can cause Bronchilitis but

42
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,960
the hallmark virus is RSV.

43
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,280
Bronchiolitis mostly affects infants and
young children, and has a 4 to 6 day

44
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,420
incubation period which is when the virus
colonizes the infant asymptotically.

45
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,870
The upper respiratory infection symptoms
and fever manifest once the innate immune

46
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,660
system recognized the virus and initiates
production and secretions of citocons.

47
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,170
A third of the infants and young children
with RSV infection will progress to lower

48
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,390
respiratory tract disease.

49
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,690
And the patient will have fast breathing
or tachypnea,

50
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,640
coughing, and respiratory distress with
retractions and wheezing.

51
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,680
Here is a video of a baby with RSV
Bronchiolitis.

52
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,473
[SOUND] What you should have noticed that
this baby is really struggling to breathe.

53
00:02:55,473 --> 00:02:57,103
He's breathing fast and in respiratory
distress.

54
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:59,850
And you can see the pulling in of the soft
tissue between his ribs and

55
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,039
above his clavicles.

56
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:07,670
This is called retractions and

57
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:15,240
is caused by the baby using his accessory
muscles to breathe.

58
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,040
So how did the baby get these symptoms?

59
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,940
The pathogenesis should be familiar to you
now.

60
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,090
It's very similar to what we discussed in
detail in

61
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,780
the upper respiratory tract video.

62
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,860
RSV infects respiratory epithelial cells
starting in the nasal mucosa, and

63
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,980
then progressing down the respiratory
tract.

64
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,815
Innate immune sensors detect PAMP's and
produce interferon other cytokines and

65
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,890
chemo-kines, which then recruit the
inflammatory cells.

66
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,210
Vascular flow, permeability and mucus
production increase.

67
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:46,750
The epithelial cells undergo apoptosis and
slough off into the airway.

68
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,210
All of this cellular debris, and the
outpouring of mucus in

69
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,480
inflammatory cells leads to plugging up of
the small airway.

70
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,490
This can trap air and lead to poor gas
exchange.

71
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,920
With worsening respiratory distress,

72
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,670
you should worry about potential clinical
complications.

73
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,290
Respiratory failure occurs when the
patient needs

74
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,210
to be entibated and mentilated.

75
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,360
It does not commonly occur.

76
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,400
But young infants are most susceptible.

77
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,710
Apnea is also more common in newborns and
premature infants.

78
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,980
And Apnea is when babies spontaneously
stop breathing.

79
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,970
This is a scary complication for both
parents and doctors.

80
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,530
Especially because it occurs in very, very
young babies.

81
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,980
Now there are certain patient populations
such as newborns and the elderly.

82
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,030
Who are at risk of more severe disease,
other because they

83
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,830
have pre-existing lung problems or, a
relatively deficient immune system.

84
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,120
You should keep these patients populations
in mind,

85
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,850
because it may effect your decisions about
how you manage and treat your patient.

86
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,600
Here are several things you should think
about when you manage and

87
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,250
treat a patient with Bronchiolitis.

88
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,690
So first you want to figure out how much
respiratory

89
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,200
distress your patient is showing?

90
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,150
What is her oxygenation?

91
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,930
Does she have retractions?

92
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,110
Is she eating and drinking normally?

93
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,010
Or is she having such a hard time
breathing that she can't eat or drink?

94
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,930
In addition you want to know if the
patient is actually getting worse or

95
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,330
getting better.

96
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,970
Next, you want to know if your patient is
in a high risk group

97
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,330
of having severe disease.

98
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,010
I already mentioned these patient
populations in the pervious slide.

99
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,000
If you find that your patients having a
really difficult time breathing and, or is

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,360
in one of these high risk groups, you may
want to admit her for closer monitoring.

101
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,280
Now treatment of Bronchiolitis is
predominately supportive.

102
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,740
You should supplement oxygen and monitor
for Apnea.

103
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,370
In some situations you may need to
intubate and

104
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,080
mechanically support the infant's
breathing.

105
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,380
Nasal gastric feeding or intravenous
fluids is important to think about.

106
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,950
Remember this baby might be quite
dehydrated because she hasn't

107
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,940
been able to take her bottle.

108
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,940
Because Bronchiolitis symptoms can be
analogous to asthma.

109
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,460
Some drugs that are used in asthma to
overcome airway obstruction have been

110
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,000
tried for Bronchiolitis.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,740
These include bronchial dilators,
epinephrine, corticosteroids.

112
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,760
However, the results have been
disappointing.

113
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,140
Although many respiratory viruses can
cause Bronchiolitis,

114
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,660
RSV is the prototypical virus.

115
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,540
Because it causes mostly Bronchiolitis, or

116
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,670
RSV is the most important viral pathogen
during the first year of life.

117
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:13,900
Unlike many of the other respiratory
viruses, RSV has only one syrotype.

118
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,090
So it's a bit surprising that reinfections
are common with RSV.

119
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,700
Now RSV is in the paramyxoviridae family,

120
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,660
just like parainfluenza virus, and
metapneumovirus.

121
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,960
Both of which can also cause
bronchiolitis.

122
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,630
Paramyxoviridae family are all RNA
envelope viruses.

123
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,120
RSV has 2 important proteins.

124
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,970
You can see them sticking out of the
capsid in the cartoon drawing.

125
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,860
Both of these proteins are important in
eliciting neutralizing antibodies.

126
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,250
The cheap protein is for attaching the
virus to the host cell receptor

127
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,550
although the actual receptor is not known.

128
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,990
The f protein is important for

129
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,440
fusing the viral envelope to the membrane
of the respiratory epithelial cell.

130
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,748
In cell culture the f protein fuses cells
together forming a syncitian.

131
00:06:57,748 --> 00:07:01,728
This is where RSV got its name,
respiratory syncytial virus.

132
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:05,330
Syncytial formation is a cell culture
phenomenon.

133
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,542
How is it with one serotype can RSV cause
re-infections?

134
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:13,581
Well RSV has multiple mechanisms of
evading the immune system.

135
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:17,370
The development of neutralizing antibody
is made at a low frequency.

136
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,420
And this may be because the G-protein has
heavily glycosylated, and

137
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,710
interferes with antibody production.

138
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,000
It can also be made in a secreted form,

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,080
acting as a decoy for neutralizing
antibodies.

140
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,250
RSV can also infect T cells by infecting
dendritic cells,

141
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,340
which then decreases their ability to
present antigen to T cells.

142
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,920
Cited toxic T cells are recognized RSV in
the lung.

143
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,260
Don't secrete key cytokines like IL2 and
interferon gamma.

144
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,820
These are important for killing the
infected cell.

145
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,050
These examples of evading and modulating
the host immune response may

146
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,060
explain why natural immunity is not
complete and not sustained.

147
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,200
The important point to remember here.

148
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,710
IS that protective immunity against RSV is
incomplete and short lived.

149
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,350
The examples I have given you are only to
illustrate this point.

150
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,684
One other important point.

151
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:07,570
The host immune response may not be robust
but it's also not zero.

152
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,250
RSV reinfections tend to not be as sever,

153
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,350
suggesting that the immune response was
protective enough against severe disease.

154
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,310
But not infection.

155
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,650
Viral disease is from actions of the virus
and from the host.

156
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,420
The clinical pattern that we observe on
the host side is that most

157
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:27,190
children older than 2 years of age don't
get severe RSV disease.

158
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,730
Why is that?
We already said that infants and

159
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,030
young children have small airways which
increases their risk of severity.

160
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,860
An added disadvantage is that infants are
born with an immature immune system.

161
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,710
And this is in addition to the mechanisms
that RSV uses to evade and

162
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,200
modulate the immune response.

163
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,710
I just discussed how an immature immune
system can lead to disease.

164
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,110
An over exuberant immune response can also
cause disease.

165
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,770
Wheezing is a clinical symptom common to
RSV Bronchoilitis and asthma.

166
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,050
There is a group of children who continue
to have recurrent wheezing.

167
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,220
Even without getting RSV infection.

168
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,980
Some of these children will eventually be
diagnosed with asthma.

169
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,810
Now it's unclear whether RSV Brochiolitis
causing asthma or,

170
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,420
is indicative of a child prone to asthma.

171
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,170
There is no RSV vaccine available.

172
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,680
Physicians do have other means of
providing some protection to infants.

173
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,610
This is in the form of passive immunity
and

174
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,500
the monoclonal Antibody is called
Palivizumab.

175
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,280
This is an antibody against the F-Protein.

176
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,710
It is given as an intravenous infusion,
and

177
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,490
given to high risk groups of infants and
young children less than 2 years of age.

178
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,020
The most recently discovered virus in
Paramyxoviridae family is

179
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,370
Human Metapneumovirus.

180
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,430
It was discovered in patients who had
Bronchiolitis very similar to

181
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,810
RSV bronchiolitis.

182
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,000
But RSV could not be isolated.

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,210
Human metapneumovirus essentially mimics
RSV.

184
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,890
Both are in the same virus family and
those are enveloped RNA viruses.

185
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,950
Human metapneumovirus only has one
serotype.

186
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,020
You should recognize the cartoon image of
the virus,

187
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,450
because it's very similar to RSV.

188
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,600
Human metapneumovirus also has a f and g
protein.

189
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,970
The epidemiology and clinical disease for

190
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:12,510
human metapneumovirus and RSV are the
same.

191
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,278
[BLANK_AUDIO]
This slide is, all of the,

192
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,840
lower respiratory tract.

193
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,940
Virus infections for you to review later.
