1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,240
In this next module, I'm going to walk
through a real example,

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,900
just to practice how to interpret the
results of logistic regression.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,560
So I'm going to use a real example from
the medical literature.

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,590
This was a case control study that was
done physicians,

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,370
who graduated from medical school at UCSF.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,670
What they were looking for, the outcome
they were interested in,

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,640
was being disciplined by the Medical Board
of California.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,050
So if a physician gets disciplined by the
medical board,

9
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,680
that's a, a pretty bad thing, so those are
the cases.

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,160
They identified 60 physicians who had a
disciplinary action.

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,160
Between 1990 and 2000.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,980
Who had graduated from USCF.

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,518
Those are the cases and our outcome
variable here is that disciplining,

14
00:00:47,518 --> 00:00:50,450
from the medical board of California.

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,634
It's a case control study so

16
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,945
the, the researchers found those people
who had been disciplined.

17
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:55,860
There's, you know, there, it's fairly
rare, so

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,690
they zoned in on them by picking those in
particular.

19
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,460
Then they found controls.

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,408
The controls were graduates 196 controls,

21
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:06,557
who were matched by medical school
graduation year, so

22
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:11,050
they were the, the same graduating class,
and speciality choice.

23
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,310
So each, for each case, the, they went out
and

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,300
found a couple of controls who came from
the same graduating class.

25
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,280
And were from the same specialty choice.

26
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,240
The aim of the study, I'm just quoting
from the paper here, was to determine if

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,300
medical students who demonstrate
unprofessional behavior in medical school

28
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,500
are more likely to have subsequent state
board disciplinary action.

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,850
So they were going back into the records
of these graduates and

30
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,690
trying to determine if there were things
that could predict subsequent disciplinary

31
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,250
action by the medical board in, in
particular.

32
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,440
They wanted to see if there was some
unprofessional behavior in medical school

33
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,970
that could flag those who were at risk of
this outcome.

34
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,160
It's a binary outcome.

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,599
You we're either disiplined are you
weren't.

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,290
What kind of analysis are we going to
analyze we're going to use to

37
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,740
analyze these data we could look at our
little chart here we've got

38
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,545
a binary outcome you were disciplined by
the medical board of California or not.

39
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:10,870
It's a case control study so the, the
outcome is case or control.

40
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,460
We want to do some kind of regression
analysis because it's an observational

41
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,105
study we want to be able to control for
confounder.

42
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,280
That might lead you to think, oh,

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,720
I should pick logistic regression and in
fact the authors of

44
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,810
this study did indeed use just a plain old
logistic regression analysis.

45
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,810
I want to just point out here though if
you look closely at this study,

46
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,900
the observations are not independent.

47
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,010
They are correlated.

48
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,180
This was a matched case control study.

49
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,780
Each case was matched to a couple of
controls.

50
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,000
So actually we should be using here the
logistic regression for

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,840
correlated data, which is something called
conditional logistic regression.

52
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,920
That accounts for the correlation.

53
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,290
So that's actually the proper statistical
technique that should of been used here.

54
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,740
It would still give odds ratios and in
this case I'm not sure it would of

55
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,000
made a huge difference to the results of
this study.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,280
but, it's correlated data so

57
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,070
that would of actually been the
appropriate statistical test to use.

58
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,900
What's the consequence here that the
others used logistic regression instead of

59
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,970
conditional logistic regression,

60
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,470
we have a situation where we are comparing
within groups.

61
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,480
Remember when we talked about correlated
data, I told you that if you ignore

62
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,640
the correlation when you're doing a within
group comparison,

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,950
that your peelers are going to be too
high.

64
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,810
That means you might miss an effect by not
analyzing the data correctly.

65
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,980
So here what you should do is compare each
case to their matched controls.

66
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,220
Cases, those, those case control groups
are more similar to

67
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,160
each other than to other people in the
study.

68
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,460
If you account for that correlation, you
actually would have gotten probably here

69
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,330
a little bit better P-values than what the
others got.

70
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,179
So their analysis could be described as a
little conservative.

71
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,540
Anything that came out significant we're
pretty sure that's real.

72
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,580
But it could have been that those P values
could of come out more significant.

73
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,230
And some of the things that didn't come
out significant,

74
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,120
in the correct analysis might have.

75
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,990
So this is a conservative analysis by
ignoring that correlation.

76
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,770
I just want to point that out,

77
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,500
to remind you the importance of thinking
about correlation.

78
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,980
In any case, the authors used a regular
old logistic regression.

79
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,650
And again these results might be a little
conservative,

80
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,710
we might have missed something here, as a
result.

81
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,060
But we can look at the odds ratios that
logistic regression model and

82
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,440
just I want to walk you through how you'd
interpret this table.

83
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,450
So this is table five from the paper.

84
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,390
This is the results of the logistic
regression analysis.

85
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,520
Notice that they're not presenting any
betas they're just simply going right for

86
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,330
the odds ratios.

87
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,710
They're not presenting any intercepts, we
don't need all of that for

88
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,200
this particular example.

89
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,590
We only care about the odds ratios.

90
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,410
So just, they're just presenting directly
the odds ratios,

91
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,620
the confidence intervals for those odds
ratios, and the p values.

92
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,770
I now want to walk you through what each
of these odds ratios means.

93
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,060
How do we interpret it?

94
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,600
So the first predictor you'll notice here
is male gender.

95
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,330
So the odds ratio here is 1.51.

96
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,020
Now, this is a fairly rare outcome.

97
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,790
So we can interpret the odds ratios like
risk ratios and

98
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,650
there's not going to be any, much
distortion of the effect here.

99
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,830
So the odds ratio is 1.51 for males.

100
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,850
It's not statistically significant, so

101
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,250
we're not sure that it's any different
than one.

102
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,920
We would say that there's a 50% increase
in the odds of disciplinary action for

103
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,390
men versus women, but it's not
statistically significant.

104
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,730
So, this model includes all the things
that you see in table, so

105
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,670
once you adjust for all of these other
factors,

106
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,690
the effect of male being male is not
statistically significant.

107
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,279
The next variable is undergraduate GPA.

108
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,570
This is a continuous predictor.

109
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,890
It ranges from zero to 4.0.

110
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,100
So the way that you interpret this odds
ratio.

111
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,470
First of all, we notice that undergraduate
GPA is protective.

112
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,720
So as your GPA goes up a whole unit.

113
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,710
So this is for a one unit increase in GPA.

114
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,570
That's pretty big.
That's like going from three to four, or

115
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,620
two to three.

116
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:17,200
A one unit jump in your GPA will decrease
your odds of disciplinary action by 43%.

117
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,400
But, it's also not statistically
significant.

118
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,320
So once you've accounted for all the other
things that, all the other variables you

119
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,360
you see in this table, the effect of
undergraduate GPA is not significant.

120
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,450
It doesn't appear to be an independent
predictor,

121
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,670
although it trends in the direction of
being protective here.

122
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,100
Interesting, the MCAT score, so the way
they measured MCAT score here,

123
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,780
it's this is comparing those who are in
the lowest quartile

124
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,880
of MCAT score to those who are in the
higher three quartiles.

125
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,010
So this is a binary variable here.

126
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,770
If you're in the lowest quartile compared
to the others, your odds ratio was 1.01.

127
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,610
So, after accounting for

128
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,890
all these other things in the table,
there's really no effect of MCAT score.

129
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,970
Interestingly enough, MCAT score was not
an independent predictor at all here.

130
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,978
The p value, as you can see, is very, very
high.

131
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:05,570
If you, another binary variable if you did
not pass

132
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:11,320
if you failed in other words if you fail
any of your courses in medical school your

133
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,050
odds ratio was 1.30 so a 30% increase in
your odds of disciplinary action, although

134
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,770
again that's clearly not statistically
significant, so that's very close to one.

135
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,130
Not an independent predictor, but in the
direction of increasing your risk.

136
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,850
Finally, if you had displayed
unprofessional behavior in

137
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,130
medical school severe enough to meet this,
their criteria, if they,

138
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,970
if you had displayed this unprofessional
behavior in medical school,

139
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,030
which they think might be a flag for later
disciplinary action.

140
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,430
This was the only significant predictor
after adjusting for

141
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,290
everything else in the model.

142
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:52,920
So that doubled your odds of getting
disciplinary action.

143
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,650
And in this case, because the outcome is
fairly rare.

144
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,600
If you said it doubled your risk of having
disciplinary action,

145
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,100
that would actually be very close.

146
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,580
So, that was the only independent
predictor, after adjusting for

147
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,960
everything else in the model.
