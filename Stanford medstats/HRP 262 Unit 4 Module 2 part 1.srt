00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,340
[BLANK_AUDIO].

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,480
In this next module, I'm going to show you
how the Cox regression model can

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,950
actually handle time changing predictors.

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:18,150
So up until now, all the statistical tests
and

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,450
models that we've dealt with, like linear
regression, logistic regression,

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,210
there was no way to allow an individual's
predictor to change over time.

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,860
Those models didn't account for

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,580
time, or take into time in any account
time in any way.

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,640
However, when we do studies where we
follow people over time,

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,150
we tend to make multiple measurements over
them.

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,260
And we allow, in at least in our data set,
we allow the covariate values,

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,980
the predictor values, for an individual to
change.

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,784
We might measure their blood pressure, or

14
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:51,450
their weight, their height, many times
over the study.

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,050
Up until now, we've kind of been throwing
that data out.

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,560
Or, you might be able to do something like
take their average weight through

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,160
the study, or their average blood
pressure.

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,389
But that's a big amount of lost
information.

19
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,770
There's all sorts of time dependent
predictors that you can imagine.

20
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,050
So you, if you're following subjects over
a time, looking at a certain

21
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:14,720
drug used the subjects may start and stop
a drug multiple times during the study.

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,420
The subjects may gain and lose large
amounts of weight.

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,760
So if you were to just put in one
measurement for

24
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,140
their weight, like their baseline weight
as the predictor in your regression model,

25
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,980
that's losing a lot of information.

26
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,780
Subjects may change their smoking habits.

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,110
They may start and stop smoking.

28
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,150
They may smoke less and smoke more.

29
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,420
So, there's so many ways in which
predictors could change over time and

30
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,230
we sort of, up until now, haven't really
had any good tools to deal with that.

31
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,390
The great thing about Cox regression is
that it can totally

32
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,130
handle time changing predictors.

33
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,000
And, that's wonderful because now this is
opening up a whole new tool kit for

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,060
us, where we can accommodate time changing
predictors into our model.

35
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,305
If you, you have to think about the
likelihood to,

36
00:01:57,305 --> 00:02:00,010
to figure out exactly how this works.

37
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,970
But just think back for a minute to the
likelihood for logistic regressions.

38
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,360
There's a likelihood for logistic
regression, if you recall,

39
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,620
had one term in the likelihood for every
person.

40
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,540
You either had the disease, the outcome,
or

41
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,150
you didn't and the likelihood term looked
something like this.

42
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,390
And so let's say we were looking at
smoking as a predictor.

43
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,630
You've got to enter one value for smoking
per person in the study.

44
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,410
They, they get one term in the likelihood.

45
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,780
Their value, their x value for smoking,
gets entered in once in the study.

46
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,400
That is not allowed to change in any way.

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,050
Now you could capture smoking in multiple
variables.

48
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,650
You could have a variable for, they're a
smoker yes or

49
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,740
no, and then also a variable for the dose
of smoking or something like that.

50
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,880
But those variables are not allowed to
change.

51
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,900
You enter them once into the likelihood
and you're done.

52
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,670
Now, think about the likelihood for Cox
regression.

53
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,570
This is why the understanding, the
likelihood is so

54
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,020
important, because this allows you to
understand time changing covariates.

55
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,860
So the likelihood for Cox regression,

56
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:06,390
remember, has a term in the likelihood for
every event time.

57
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,700
So, maybe there's an event at time one,
and

58
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,030
there's an event at time three in the
study.

59
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,520
There's a subject who say was at risk at
time one and

60
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,790
their value, for let's say we are looking
at weight, so maybe their value for

61
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,400
weight at the first time point where there
was an event in the study was 200 pounds.

62
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,950
They are entered into the denominator
because they were at risk at

63
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,620
event time one.

64
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,190
But, that person, say they're still at
risk at event time three.

65
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,830
They get entered a second time,

66
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,650
they get entered into the denominator for
the term for event time three.

67
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,840
Well now we don't, we're not forced to
re-enter the same weight of 200.

68
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,580
Maybe their weight went down and maybe
they're, they're now 180 pounds.

69
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,430
We can now update their weight.

70
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,960
Every time an event occurs, there is a new
term added to the likelihood and

71
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,670
we get to re-enter all of, every, for
everybody who is at risk,

72
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,990
we get to re-enter all of their values for
the predictors, so we can change them.

73
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,590
In this way,

74
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,100
Cox regression can handle time-changing
predictors, which is really, really cool.

75
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm going to go through a full example
with the likelihood you're going to have

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,030
had your fill of likelihoods by the end of
this unit, but

77
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,110
I'm going to go through a full example of
the likelihood in just a minute.

78
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,880
But I just wanted to let you know that
we've actually seen an example where time

79
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,474
dependent covariates were used and
actually make a lot of sense.

80
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:31,010
So I'm going back now to this example
about looking at

81
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,080
survival in Academy Award-winning actors
and actresses.

82
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,240
And this is the one, I am taking the table
for the one that was looking at actors and

83
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,580
actresses and comparing those who actually
won an Academy Award,

84
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,990
to those who were ever only nominated.

85
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,930
So if you recall, looking at the winners
compared with nominees only,

86
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,660
there did appear to be some survival
advantage for the winners.

87
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,800
Unadjusted it was a hazard ratio of 0.75,
indicating

88
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,100
a 25% relative reduction in the mortality
rate for winners versus nominees.

89
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,910
If you adjusted for

90
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,944
some other factors, it went down just
slightly to a hazard ratio of 0.78,

91
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:14,060
about a 22% reduction in the mortality
rate for winners versus nominees.

92
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,610
I've mentioned this study several times
and I alluded to the fact that

93
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,630
there is a problem with the way that the
authors originally did their analysis.

94
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,820
So, if you think about the Kaplan-Meier
curve for this data set, so

95
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:34,860
here are the say, here are the winners and
here are the nominees only.

96
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,418
It looks something like that, making that
up.

97
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:41,490
It actually probably doesn't diverge until
they hit about 50 but something like that.

98
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,800
Here's the problem with the original
analysis.

99
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,880
So notice we've got a curve that's winners
and we've got a curve that's nominees.

100
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,150
And what they're doing is they're saying
hey,

101
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,270
you were always a winner since birth,
right?

102
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,090
They're counting that the winners are
being counted as winners since the,

103
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,020
the day they were born.

104
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,970
This is, this analysis was done from time
of birth.

105
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,260
So you're being counted in the winner
group from the day you're born or

106
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,190
you're being counted,

107
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,420
you're being counted in the nominated only
group from the day that you're born.

108
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:17,250
Well obviously, if winning actually has
some effect on longevity,

109
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,930
it can't have that effect on longevity
until after you've actually won the award.

110
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,570
That winning can't retroactively somehow
increase your longevity.

111
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,902
So this analysis had, had this problem,
this bias in it,

112
00:06:29,902 --> 00:06:32,360
which we talked about a little bit before.

113
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,150
A natural way to solve, to deal with that
problem, would be to say well, I, you know

114
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,500
in the Kaplan-Meier curve I kind of have
to group one group and another group and

115
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,010
it's hard to incorporate time changing
predictors into that graphic.

116
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,290
But the Cox regression model can
completely handle time

117
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,390
changing predictors.

118
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:54,013
So in fact, the authors of that original
paper did do an analysis where they used

119
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:58,462
a time-dependent covariate for winning
and, and only being nominated.

120
00:06:58,462 --> 00:07:02,046
So you can read from their text, this was
buried a little bit in the text, but

121
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,622
it says analyses using time-dependent
covariates,

122
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:08,350
in which winners were counted as controls,
until the time of first victory.

123
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,390
So they were accounted as controls or only
nominated,

124
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,640
until the time of first victory, yielded a
relative reduction of 20%.

125
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,040
So this is a more correct analysis because
it,

126
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,150
what they're doing is they're saying okay,
up until the age at which you

127
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,150
actually won the award, you are counted as
in the control group.

128
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,940
Again, this works fine in the likelihood,
because imagine the first death happens,

129
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,070
you know, maybe around 50.

130
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,780
So event that happens at 50.

131
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:41,000
If a person who is at risk at 50 has not
yet won their Academy Award, then they're

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,470
going to get a zero for winner versus
nominee in that model at that event time.

133
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,950
And then, maybe at when another event
occurs at age 60, and

134
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,180
maybe they are still at risk, but by now
they won the award, say at 55 years old,

135
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,260
now we count them as a winner only in that
term in the likelihood and

136
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,820
not in any terms before they won.

137
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,810
So we are able to now make sure that we're
not counting somebody as,

138
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,630
as the the effect of winning, we're not
having it kind of act retroactively.

139
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,620
So this is a great way to analyze these
data.

140
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,920
It did yield a smaller effect size.

141
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,620
It yielded an effect size of a relative
reduction of 20%.

142
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,510
And they don't tell us in the paper is
that adjusted for any covariance or not.

143
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,850
I'm kind of guessing that it's probably
just a basic analysis.

144
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,030
An additional adjustment may attenuate
this even a little bit further.

145
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,860
Notice it's starting to boarder on being
nonsignificant here.

146
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,430
So one of the criticisms of that paper,
you know, later on, is people said,

147
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,820
well, that more proper analysis was buried
in the paper and the,

148
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,541
the authors chose to highlight kind of
the, the less good analysis.

149
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:50,210
And indeed, when a few years later, some
other authors did

150
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,490
a reanalysis of the original data, this is
a kind of a busy table, but

151
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,780
I'll just want to highlight one thing, in
their new analysis,

152
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,840
they didn't do time-dependent covariance,
they did something slightly different.

153
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,910
But notice that the hazard ratio that they
came out with their new analysis

154
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:11,140
accounting for this immortal time bias,
trying to avoid that bias.

155
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,630
They came out with a relative risk
reduction of about 18%, so it's very close

156
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,410
to what the original authors got with
their time-dependent covariant mode.

157
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,840
So they probably, those original authors
should have reported and

158
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,312
highlighted that time-dependent model from
the start.

159
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,060
All right, so now let me just kind of

160
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,149
delve in with a very simple data set how
this actually works in the likelihood.

161
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,280
And I'm going to use a simple data set, I
just made up these data, but

162
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,950
I'm basing it off some real data that I
was analyzing many years back, looking at

163
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,220
the effect of oral contraceptives on
stress fracture risk in women runners.

164
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,160
There is some thought that if you're
taking exogenous hormones, there have been

165
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,530
some studies that have linked that to a
reduced risk of stress fractures.

166
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,460
The exogenous hormones may suppress your
bone turnover and

167
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,210
therefore make you a little bit less at
risk of fracturing.

168
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,960
The problem is, if you wanted to, if
you're doing a cohort study, where you're

169
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,120
following women over time and you're
measuring time to fracture, which is the,

170
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,760
the outcome here, you could imagine doing
an analysis where you just put in

171
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,250
a single variable for oral contraceptive
risk that doesn't change over time.

172
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,610
Like they never used oral contraceptives
is a common way of looking at

173
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,580
oral contraceptives.

174
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,161
You ever took them or you didn't take
them.

175
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:25,693
Or, you could say whether or not they are
taking them at baseline.

176
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:28,893
Or you could, have some measure of the
cumulative amount of

177
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:33,295
total time a woman has taken them, you
know, in her life or something like that.

178
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:36,047
There's a lot of ways you can force that
variable,

179
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:39,823
that predictor oral contraceptive you sent
to something static, but

180
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:43,660
in fact, again with Cox regression we're
not forced to do that.

181
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,580
We could instead say, well, if a woman
stops or

182
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,190
starts taking oral contraceptives, we can
accommodate that in our model.

183
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,510
So again, there's a lot of different ways
you can look at oral contraceptive use.

184
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,160
This comes up with a lot of different
exposures.

185
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,310
How am I actually going to measure that
and report that in my model?

186
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,700
So the non time-dependent ways of looking
at this,

187
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,500
which is sort of what we were stuck with,
for logistic regression and so on,

188
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,570
was things like did a women ever use them
was she using them yes or no at baseline.

189
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:17,370
Some kind of simple binary variables or
something like the total months of

190
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,620
use during the study or the total months
of use in the lifetime.

191
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,606
Those are all a single static variable
that could be entered into say,

192
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:27,010
a logistic regression model.

193
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,210
However, we're no longer stuck just
forcing our oral contraceptive use

194
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,120
measurement, exposure measurement into one
of those.

195
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,920
We could, with Cox regression, now look at
time-dependent predictors.

196
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,830
So we could have a model that incorporates
oral contraceptive use as a,

197
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,400
you are either on it or

198
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,810
off it at a given time and that's allowed
to change during the course of the study.

199
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,450
That's the one I'm actually going to look
at because it's a little bit simpler.

200
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,830
We could even do something even a little
more fancy, like say,

201
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:00,040
how many months has someone used the oral
contraceptives up until each event time or

202
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,620
something like that.

203
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,720
We'll stick with the binary one.

204
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,750
Allow, a woman here is allowed to on them
or off them and switch on and off.

205
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,820
And again, these are just some made up
data, but, you know,

206
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,570
based on some real data I was looking at.

207
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,530
And I had just done this for seven
subjects to keep it really simple, so

208
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,380
we can write out the whole likelihood.

209
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,127
So we have an ID number identifying the
subject,

210
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:22,415
a time that each woman was in the study,
time to event or sensory, whether or

211
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:26,569
not she fractured, 1 is fractured, 0 is
censored, and then the time at

212
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:31,260
which she start and, started and stopped
oral contraceptives within the study.

213
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,744
So if it's time 0 for starting OC's, that
means that she was on them at baseline, or

214
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:39,933
she started them at baseline, and this
woman, for example, the first woman here,

215
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:43,532
was on oral contraceptives at baseline,
started them at baseline, and

216
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:46,050
stopped them 12 months into the study.

217
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:51,160
There are one, two, three, four events,
four fractures that occurred in the study.

218
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,670
So there's going to be four terms in our
likelihood and

219
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,800
the rest of the women were censored.

220
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,880
I went ahead and drew out already a little
picture representing these data just so

221
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,630
we don't have to, spend time, you don't
have to spend time sitting and

222
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,050
watching me draw.

223
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,206
So but let me just show you what this
little picture shows.

224
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:10,370
So again our, in our time here is time in
the study from zero up to

225
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,020
the study went as long as two years.

226
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,732
The first woman for example, was in the
study for 12 months before she

227
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:21,110
fractured and I'm representing a fracture
with an x and a c represents censored.

228
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,646
So I have her in the study from 0 to 12
months and she fractures at 12 months and

229
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:27,500
then she's no longer at risk for first
fracture.

230
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,690
I represented the time at which a woman is
on OCs, the time period where

231
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,660
she's actually taking the pill, the oral
contraceptives, with a little blue line.

232
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,486
So I, for example, this first woman was on
oral contraceptives from month 0 to

233
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,580
month 12 in the study.

234
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,050
So her whole line is covered with a blue
line here,

235
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,120
indicating she was on the drug at all the
times of the study.

236
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,040
The second woman was only taking oral
contraceptives from month 10 to month 11.

237
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,090
So that's represented here as a teeny blue
line on her graph and so on.

238
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,830
And subjects three and six never took oral
contraceptives during this

239
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,850
study represented as that there was no
starting and stop time for them.

240
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,670
So that's just to,

241
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,250
a pictorial representation of the data,
which is a little bit easier to deal with.

242
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,510
So now I'm going to show you a couple of
time-independent predictors,

243
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,560
what the likelihood would look like if we
were doing time-independent predictors.

244
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,510
So let's start with a very simple one.

245
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,090
You were on oral contraceptives at
baseline, yes or no.

246
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,900
A lot of times we end up using the
baseline exposure.

247
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,200
And so, let's say we chose to use the
baseline exposure.

248
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,170
A woman was taking oral contraceptives at
start of the study or not.

249
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,380
That's our predictor in our model.

250
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:36,035
So our Cox regression model, would be the
log hazard is equal to,

251
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:41,323
we would have just a beta for yes, no
baseline use.

252
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:44,260
And a woman would just get a yes or no, a
one or a zero in there.

253
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,370
So, what would this actually look like in
terms of the likelihood, okay?

254
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,210
So the likelihood is a function of this
beta of yes, no use.

255
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,780
It starts with the first event.

256
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,970
So the first event, if you look over here
on my little graphic,

257
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,940
at six months into the study, subject
number 6 fractures, okay?

258
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,390
So, we look at subject to six months into
the study, everybody is still at risk, so

259
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,130
everybody's going to be in the denominator
here.

260
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,270
And our predictor here is baseline use of
oral contraceptive.

261
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,516
So, subject one was on OC's at baseline.

262
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,343
She's going to have a value of one for

263
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:23,840
that variable, subject four was also on
OC's baseline and subject five was.

264
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,680
So, those three will have ones, for

265
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,820
the variable baseline oc use, and
everybody else will have zero.

266
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,610
So then we can just write out the
likelihood.

267
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:38,460
So, the person who fractured was not a
baseline user of oral contraceptives.

268
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,029
So this is event time, the event that
occurred at six months.

269
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,050
And she was, the one who fractured was not
a user at baseline and

270
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,550
then we had I'm just going to this is a
yes, no variable.

271
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,015
So I'm just going to count up the number
of risk, women at risk with ones for

272
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:58,142
this variable and the number of risk,
women at risk with zeroes.

273
00:15:58,142 --> 00:16:02,832
So at six months into the study, subject
one was at risk, subject four was at risk,

274
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:04,540
and subject five was at risk.

275
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,230
So there were three women who had a value
of one for

276
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,076
this variable of OC use at baseline.

277
00:16:11,076 --> 00:16:12,160
There were four women,

278
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,340
everybody else, who had a value of zero,
including the one who fractured.

279
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,170
So that would be the first terminal
likelihood.

280
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,520
The second term in the likelihood occurs
at 12 months into the study.

281
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,710
There is another fracture.

282
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,180
A second woman fractures 12 months into
the study.

283
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,680
At that time point, so she is going to be
the numerator, she was,

284
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,930
the one who fractured, was a baseline user
of oral contraceptives.

285
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,550
So she gets a one value for this variable.

286
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,960
And everybody else is at risk, except
there was one woman who was

287
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,570
censored at 11 months and there was one
woman who had the fracture at six months.

288
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,840
Those two are no longer at risk.

289
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,530
So there are five women at risk.

290
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,770
Of the ones at risk, there's one, two,
three for baseline OC users.

291
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,360
And their are two who were not.

292
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,960
Subjects three and seven were not.

293
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:09,153
So we have three baseline OC users at risk
and two not at risk.

294
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,820
And then we can keep going.

295
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,640
You get the idea.

296
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,870
We can keep going and do this for

297
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,100
the fracture that happened at month 17,
and then for the final fracture.

298
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,080
I'm going to just leave that on the next
slide.

299
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,962
If you want to see the whole thing written
out, it's going to look like that.

300
00:17:23,962 --> 00:17:28,810
So, again, these two terms I just did out,
if you wanted to keep going, make sure,

301
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,170
test yourself, make sure you can get these
two terms as well.

302
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,270
That's what the likelihood looks like.

303
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,180
The key, though, is that you're going to
see that this likelihood looks

304
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,679
different than when we treat oral
contraceptive use in different ways.

305
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,370
I'm going to just do one quickly, one more
time-independent predictor, because just

306
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:48,360
to show you there's even lots of choices
of how you could model this exposure.

307
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,540
What if we instead chose ever/never used
during the study rather than baseline use?

308
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,080
So we looked at women across the study and

309
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,480
said if you ever used it, you get a value
for this variable of one.

310
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,810
So who's going to get a value of one for
this variable?

311
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:04,202
So, subject one, subject two, subject
four, subject five and subject seven, all

312
00:18:04,202 --> 00:18:08,430
five of them used the oral contraceptives
at least sometime during this study.

313
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,510
Only Subjects three and six never used it.

314
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:16,560
So, the likelihood then, is going to be,
for

315
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:23,720
this variable, again, six months into the
study, everybody's at risk.

316
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,920
The one who has the fracture was a never
user of oral contraceptives.

317
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,890
There are actually five women, one, two,
three, four, five, who ever

318
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,170
used oral contraceptives, who are still at
risk at six months into the study.

319
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,080
And there were two who never used it.

320
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,430
And we could keep going.

321
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,820
We could do the likelihood for 12 months
and 17 months and so on.

322
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,160
There's going to be four terms in the
likelihood.

323
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,090
Again, I'll leave that to you to finish
that one up.

324
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,220
But I've written it out here.

325
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,108
You can again test yourself to make sure
you're getting the right likelihood.

326
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:58,660
That's another time-independent predictor,

327
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,770
because we're not allowing women to change
over time.

328
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,548
Now let's move to what's really important
here, is the time-dependent predictors.

329
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:09,540
So, the time-dependent predictor that I'm
going to use here,

330
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,270
there's more than one we can come up with,
but the simplest one is just to say,

331
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,770
is a woman on oral contraceptives at a
given event time.

332
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,720
She is either on them at that time when an
event occurs or she's not.

333
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,900
So lets look at how that's going to be
reflected in the likelihood.

334
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,260
So, again, first event happens at six
months into the study.

335
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,830
Subject six has a fracture six months into
the study.

336
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,860
Everybody else is still at risk at that
event time.

337
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,340
What's, what are we going to represent in
the likelihood, okay?

338
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,800
So first of all, we are now counting a
woman as being on OC's.

339
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,930
If she's on OC's at that time, so anybody
who has a blue over her at, over her

340
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,730
line at six months, those are the ones who
are on oral contraceptives at six months.

341
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,762
So at six months, subject one is on oral
contraceptives, subject four is,

342
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:58,740
subject five is, subject six is not, and
subject seven is.

343
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,725
So the, this is again a binary predictor,
but

344
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:03,980
we're allowing it to change now in
different event times.

345
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,310
The one who had the fracture here was not
on oral contraceptives at that time.

346
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:13,460
There were one, two, three, four, who were
on oral contraceptives at six months

347
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,550
into the study, so they each get a value
of 1 in their terms, in the likelihood.

348
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,769
There were three, who at six months were
not on oral contraceptives.

349
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,490
All right, so that's the first term in the
likelihood.

350
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,810
The second term in the likelihood happens
at 12 months into the study.

351
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,650
At 12 months into the study, there are
still five women at risk.

352
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,700
Subjects one, three, four, five and seven
are still at risk.

353
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,650
Subject two has dropped out and subject
six already had a fracture.

354
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,760
At that time, the one who fractures,
subject number one,

355
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,200
is at that time taking oral
contraceptives.

356
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,800
She is on or, oral contraceptives at 12
months.

357
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,650
However, subject three is not on oral
contraceptives at that time.

358
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,540
Subject four is on oral contraceptives at
that time and

359
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:02,000
subject five is not on oral contraceptives
at that time.

360
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,130
So we have one, two women who are taking
oral contraceptives at that time.

361
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,970
Now notice, subject seven is the one to
focus on here.

362
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,730
Subject seven, in the first term in the
likelihood, she got a value of one for

363
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,990
this variable, because she was on oral
contraceptives at that time.

364
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,530
Now she's switching over.

365
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:28,540
In the second term in the likelihood
subject seven is getting a value of zero.

366
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,290
So she is, has switched.

367
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,330
If we were to write out an individual
hazard term for

368
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,680
her, for the first term in the likelihood,

369
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,070
in the second, you'll notice that her
value went from one to zero.

370
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,800
She was allowed to switch.

371
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,860
All right, now how about the third term in
the likelihood?

372
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:48,280
So the third event happens at 17 months
into the study,and at that time,

373
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,330
the one who fractures is subject seven.

374
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,460
At that time, she is not on oral
contraceptives.

375
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,230
So in the first term in the likelihood she
had a one,

376
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,880
every other term she's had a zero.

377
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,300
Then at that time, there were four woman
at risk.

378
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,250
Three were not on oral contraceptives at
that time and one was.

379
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,790
And then the final event happens at 20
months into this study.

380
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,170
At that time there's only two women left
at risk.

381
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,090
One of them, subject four, is on oral
contraceptives and one is not.

382
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,092
So the one who fractures is not taking
oral contraceptives at that time, and

383
00:22:19,092 --> 00:22:22,709
there's one who is taking them and one who
is not taking them at that time.

384
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,540
So again, the likelihood function now
looks different because of

385
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,300
the fact that we're allowing women to
change their value.

386
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,100
Women have different values in different
terms in the likelihood.

387
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,662
So that's what the likelihood is going to
look like for

388
00:22:36,662 --> 00:22:38,313
this time-dependent predictor.

389
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:41,329
And so you'll notice that the likelihoods
look different for

390
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:45,389
the time-dependent predictor versus the
ever, never use versus the baseline use

391
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:49,275
and so that means the beta coefficients
are going to come out slightly different,

392
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:51,800
depending on which of these models you
choose.

393
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,700
What's it actually going to mean if we put
a time-dependent predictor in the model?

394
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,570
And let's say we put a time-dependent
predictor in the model and

395
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,750
we have a bigger data set and oral
contraceptive use does indeed come out to

396
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,790
be a significantly protective factor
against stress fractures.

397
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:11,320
What that's going to mean is that, at the
moment, the way we've modeled it here,

398
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,000
is that at the moment that you're taking
oral contraceptives,

399
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,540
you get some protection from them.

400
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,710
And the interpretations of those betas are
going to be different.

401
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,990
So one says, if you're taking a, you know,
an oral contraceptive ever,

402
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,240
that that's somehow going to protect you
against fractures, having ever taken it.

403
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,642
That seems like a less, you know, that's
going to be a less good measure here.

404
00:23:31,642 --> 00:23:36,300
The time-dependent OC use tells us that,
if you're on oral contraceptives, that,

405
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,650
when you're on them you are, have some
protection against stress fractures, if

406
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,340
this were to come out as a statistically
significant protective effect.

407
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,120
So the interpretation of the betas changes
as well.
