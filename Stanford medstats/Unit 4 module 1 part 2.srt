1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,860
Alright, now, we're going to jump to the
continuous case.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,220
As I said, the continuous case is a little
bit more tricky.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,230
It's a little bit more math involved in
this.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,575
We're just going to touch upon the
continuous case this week.

5
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:15,740
But, if you have any continuous
mathematical function, if that

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,140
function integrates to 1, that just means
that the area under that curve is 1.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,850
Then, it is by default a probability
function.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,760
The probabilities associated with a
continuous probability function are just,

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,900
again, areas under the curve.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,360
Just integrals.

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,320
And, probabilities are going to be given
for a range of values rather than

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,457
any particular value, so in the discrete
case, we talked about the probability that

13
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:40,690
exactly 1 occurs, or the probability that
exactly 9 occurs.

14
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,700
With a continuous case there are no
particular,

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,730
there's an infinite number of possible
particular values, so

16
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,630
we're always talking about the
probabilities of ranges of values.

17
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,626
Like, what's the probability that it will
fall between 1 and 2?

18
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:54,310
So let me just give you an example to make
this clear.

19
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,539
So, a very simple but

20
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:01,050
important probability function is the
exponential distribution.

21
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,660
And let me just write up what that
function is.

22
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,060
So, the exponential distribution is e
raised to negative x.

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,230
We call that the exponential distribution
in probability.

24
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,760
And that function is just a mathematical
function,

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,510
where the area under the curve is one.

26
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,160
And we can kind of just draw a picture of
that function to see that.

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,380
You can't have negative values.

28
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,350
So it starts at one and it kind of goes
down towards the x-axis like that.

29
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,950
Now, if I just told you that the area
under that curve is 1,

30
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,100
you'd probably say that sounds reasonable,
right?

31
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,070
If you were to calculate the area under
the curve here, it starts at 1 and

32
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,030
it goes down towards the x value, it seems
reasonable that that area might be 1.

33
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,620
So if you want to just believe me, that's,
that's fine.

34
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,780
I can also show you the interval for those
who are interested.

35
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,730
Again, this is optional,

36
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,890
but we could take the integral over all
possible values of this function.

37
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,830
So you can have any value from the x, can
be anything from 0 to infinity.

38
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,496
If we take the integral of e raised to
negative x.

39
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:57,250
And we, we integrated over the, from 0 to
infinity.

40
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,396
We get a value of 1.

41
00:01:58,396 --> 00:02:02,160
Again, that, that integral is just there
for those of you who want it, but

42
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,950
that just proves that the area under the
curve is 1,

43
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,588
therefore, it's a probability function.

44
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:08,330
So here is the same function, just drawn
out.

45
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,630
We call this the e raised to the negative
x,

46
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,240
we call that function a probability
density function.

47
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,610
It's analogous to a probability mass
function, that little table where I

48
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,130
wrote out if x is this, the probability of
x is that, for for the discrete case.

49
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,170
But really, the probability density
function it gives us this curve, but

50
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,730
we can't really talk about the probability
of any particular value off of this curve,

51
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,620
because there's an infinite number of
possible distance, different values here.

52
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,640
So we can't really assign probabilities to
any particular value,

53
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,790
we can only assign probabilities to a
range of values.

54
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,570
So we're always talking about a range of
values.

55
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,620
because if you say, what's the probability
of getting a value of 1?

56
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,530
Well, do you mean 1 or do you mean 1.0, do
you mean 1.023?

57
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,860
Right?
So you're always really talking about

58
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,532
a range of values.

59
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:54,890
So, in, that means that, when again, when
we're talking about a range of values,

60
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,840
we're actually a, talking about a
cumulative distribution function rather

61
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,160
than a probability mass function.

62
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,750
But don't worry about that terminology.

63
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,720
All that means is, instead of looking at
the original function,

64
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,120
we're looking at the area under the curve.

65
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,800
And again areas under the curve happen to
be calculated with integrals, but

66
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,710
you can kind of look at this picture I'm
showing here.

67
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,520
So like if I asked,

68
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,360
what's the probability on an exponential
function of being between 1 and 2?

69
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,819
Well, you could kind of just draw in that
area and you could almost estimate it just

70
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:26,400
from looking at the picture, that that's
around, you know, a quarter of the area.

71
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,710
Or, you could do out the actual integral,
which I'm showing on the bottom for

72
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,045
those of you who want to see the integral
done out.

73
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,500
We could do the integral from 1 to 2 and

74
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,220
we find out that precisely the area under
the curve here is 23%.

75
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,650
And here's an example of how this might be
used in medicine.

76
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,450
So let's say that we found out, we did a
study and

77
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,590
found out that survival times after lung
transplant roughly follow

78
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,110
an exponential distribution, an
exponential function .

79
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,340
So people are dying after a lung
transplant at a certain rate.

80
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,640
If it follows an exponential function,
then we can use that information or

81
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,598
approximately follows an exponential
function to get,

82
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,540
to calculate the probabilities of survival
in different time periods.

83
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,400
So for example, the probability that a
patient will die in the second year after

84
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,000
surgery, somewhere between the year one
they will survive up through year one but

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,350
die before year two, that that is they
will die between years one and two.

86
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,580
If we get the end of the curve it's 23%,
so

87
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,150
their probability of dying in that
interval is 23%.

88
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,880
So it has very useful applications, the
exponential function in survival analysis.

89
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,280
We'll talk about that in the very last
week of the course.

90
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,890
Another example of a useful,

91
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,970
continuous probability function is the
uniform distribution.

92
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,520
It's a very simple, nice little function.

93
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,450
So it's easy to, to understand, so

94
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,270
it's easy for illustrating some of, some
of these concepts.

95
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,320
So the uniform distribution is just a
distribution where you can,

96
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,250
x can only take on values between zero and
one, and they all have equal probability.

97
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,220
Hence, it's uniform.

98
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,400
And you can see,

99
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,250
it just makes that function, literally
just makes a little box, a little square.

100
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,971
And the area under the, the curve here,
the area in that box has to be 1, right?

101
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,160
The, the width is 1, the length is 1, so 1
times 1 is 1.

102
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,590
You can also prove that the area under the
curve is one by doing

103
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,390
an interval here should you choose, of
course, we don't really need that because

104
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,310
everybody knows that the area under of
that box is just one.

105
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,930
So the very simple little distribution and
it's easy even without knowing any

106
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,450
calculus to calculate areas under the
curve here.

107
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,700
So for example if I said,

108
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,860
what's the probability that x is between a
quarter and a half?

109
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,560
Well, that's going to be 1 4th or

110
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,210
if I said, what's the probability that x
is between 0 and 1 ?

111
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,810
Well, that's going to be 50%.

112
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,390
And this has real practical implications
in medical research.

113
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,130
So, for example, when you're doing a
randomized trial, and

114
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,310
you're randomizing patients.

115
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,710
Say you're, you're randomizing half the
patients to treatment and

116
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,520
half the patients to control.

117
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,810
The typical way that you would do that is
to use a random number generator in

118
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,310
a computer.

119
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,010
And, one of the random number generators
available to

120
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:01,429
you works by randomly generating a number
between 0 and

121
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:03,810
1 with equal probabilities of all the
numbers in between.

122
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,840
In other words, it's based on a uniform
distribution.

123
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,940
Every subject has an equal probability of
getting it, any number between 0 and 1.

124
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,090
So you can arbitrarily say if the subject
ends up with a number below 0.5,

125
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,530
we're going to call them control.

126
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,750
If the subject ends up with a number above
0.5, we're going to call them treatment.

127
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,340
That will randomly assign people to
treatment and

128
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,751
control with 50-50 probability.

129
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:30,500
And I had a case a couple of years back
where a student of mine had done some

130
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,670
a research project where she had randomly
assigned people to a treatment group and

131
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,260
a control group.

132
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,530
And then actually literally flipped a coin
you know, an actual

133
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,760
point to decide where people were going,
which group they were going to end up in.

134
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,590
And the reviewer one of the reviewers of
her paper came back and

135
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,250
said, well, they were, they didn't like
the fact that it was done manually,

136
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,690
that that a person had actually flipped
coins.

137
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,220
Because that allowed the probability,

138
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,300
the problem that you could introduce error
or bias.

139
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,770
And so, it's better to have your computer
virtually flip coins.

140
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,670
And, and this is what I just described is
exactly the computer flipping

141
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,960
a coin virtually.

142
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,219
So it's very useful for things like
randomizing patients.

143
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,340
Now, all probability distributions have
two features to them that

144
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,480
are very important, they have a mean and a
variance.

145
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,530
And this mean and variance are just like
the mean and

146
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,720
variance that we talked about in the first
week of the course.

147
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,770
So in the next couple of modules, I'm
going to tell you how to calculate

148
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,400
the mean and variance for a probability
distribution rather than for data.

149
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,340
And we've already seen some mean and
variance of probability distributions.

150
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,100
We saw the normal curve before.

151
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,410
The normal curve has a mean, and it has a
standard deviation.

152
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,780
So, we've seen these before.

153
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,530
Now, I'm going to show you how to
calculate them.
