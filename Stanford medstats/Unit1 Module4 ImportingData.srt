1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,920
>> In the last module, we showed you what
a dataset looks like in SAS.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,440
You might be wondering where that dataset
comes from.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,485
>> That's what we'll show you today.

4
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:11,535
>> [SOUND] Your data set can come in many
different file types.

5
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:14,480
[SOUND] Often times you might get a
dataset as an Excel file,

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,150
which will have the file format .xls or
.xlsx.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,310
Another common file type used with Excel
is a .csv file.

8
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:28,305
SAS has it's own file format for data sets
called .sas7b.

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,300
All of these file types and many more, can
be imported directly into SAS.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,470
>> Many researchers like to use red cap to
collect their data.

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,202
We will not be discussing Red Cap and

12
00:00:38,202 --> 00:00:43,110
HRP223, that being said if your data's an
online Red Cap database we can

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,731
provide you with a special program that
will let you import that into SaS as well.

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,220
>> Let's take another look at that data
set we showed you last time.

15
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,720
It's hard to tell what a lot of this
means, the columns have strange names and

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,220
it's hard to tell what these one's and
zero's mean.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,450
What we need is a data dictionary.

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,290
This is basically an explanation of each
variable is, and

19
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,220
how the variables are encoded.

20
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,480
Here is what a data dictionary might look
like.

21
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,090
Now we can see that the variable Hospidays
represents the length of

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,620
the hospital stay measured in days.

23
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,978
CHF is a variable about heart failure
complications.

24
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:21,560
If his [INAUDIBLE] has complications, they
are entered as a one.

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,000
And if they didn't, they are entered as a
zero.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,100
>> Whenever you get a data set, make sure
you also get a data dictionary, or

27
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,250
else you will not be able to interpret the
data.

28
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,170
Sometimes, people like to put a data
dictionary at the top of an Excel file.

29
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,440
If you can, try to open up your data set
in Excel and look at the data set and

30
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,509
case it as a dictionary.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,890
We were just describing a data set in SAS
Enterprise Guide, but I want to take

32
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,890
step back and show you how to import your
data using the point and click method.

33
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,230
Even though I tend to write most of my own
code in SAS,

34
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,210
I still like to use the point and click
method to import data.

35
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,370
This method makes it easy to rename
variables, specify permanent folder, and

36
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,070
ensure that SAS is importing the variables
in the right format.

37
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,990
>> If you're using an Excel file, open it
in Excel first and

38
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,990
make sure that first row contains the
variable names.

39
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,370
Sometimes people include things like a
data dictionary, or

40
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,090
other comments which are not data or
variable names.

41
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,860
If there's any extra information, delete
it.

42
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,510
>> Since we're dealing with a new project
in SAS, let's open it up.

43
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,160
Our first step is going to be to
reestablish our permanent folder,

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,820
by pointing to the folder we created in
the previous module,

45
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,430
we can save the data set in a permanent
file.

46
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,190
First open up a new project, which we've
already done.

47
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,760
Paste in the code which we've also already
done,

48
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,850
and then point to the permanent folder.

49
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,190
Now, we're ready to import our Excel data
set.

50
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,660
>> Click on File and then Import Data.

51
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,200
Navigate to the file you want to import
and then click Open.

52
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,720
>> In the next page,

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,600
you can specify which library you wish to
import your data in to.

54
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,540
By default, you can save it in to the work
library.

55
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,760
If you'd like to save your data into a
different library,

56
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,740
such as a permanent library you've already
made, click Browse to find that library.

57
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,463
We're going to save our data into the
HRP223 library we just made.

58
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:08,230
Select a library and then click Save.

59
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,789
When you're done specifying your library,
click Next.

60
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,570
>> If you're importing data from an Excel
file with multiple worksheets,

61
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,530
you can select the right worksheet here on
the left.

62
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,980
Also, make sure to check the box that
says,

63
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,950
first row of range contains field names,
and click Next.

64
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,770
On the next page, please make sure to
check each variable and

65
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,820
verify that it is being imported in the
correct format.

66
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,290
>> If you have a new Mac variable, the
data type should give us this number.

67
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,160
If you have a date variable, the data type
should be able to send us date.

68
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,260
If you have a categorical variable, with
data entered as words or

69
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,710
characters, the data type should be listed
as string.

70
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,050
You can specify the data type, by
selecting the variable and

71
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,710
clicking Modify.

72
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,670
This step crucial because if you
mis-specify your data type.

73
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,780
But problems with your analysis.

74
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,820
So here we can see that the age variable
is specified by a string.

75
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,400
That's incorrect, so lets click Modify and
fix that.

76
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,150
Now, we'll correctly specify it as number.

77
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,100
>> While you're on this page, you can also
specify the name and

78
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,300
or label of each variable if you'd like to
rename it.

79
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,210
Variable names can not have any spaces,
and

80
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,350
are used in specifying the variables for
analysis.

81
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,280
On the other hand, variable labels can be
lengthy descriptions with or

82
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,770
without spaces.

83
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,370
These are used in graphics and, or tables.

84
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,110
>> Once you make sure that your variables
are correctly represented,

85
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,090
click Next and Finish.

86
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,099
>> Your data set has now been imported
into SAS Enterprise Guide.

87
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,195
>> Now, you can put it into the data set,

88
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:38,790
you can double check, if that everything
is in order.

89
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,580
The column names have icons next to them,

90
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,790
which indicate which data type they are
entered as.

91
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,890
This blue icon indicates that its a number
variable.

92
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,810
And this red icon, indicates that its the
string variable.

93
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,630
This one's incorrect.

94
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,779
Click Modify Task.

95
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,505
And go back to the field attribute, to
correctly specify your variable.

96
00:04:58,505 --> 00:04:59,864
[SOUND].

97
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:07,838
[BLANK_AUDIO]

98
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:09,323
>> Now everything looks correct,

99
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:13,510
please always make sure to check the to
define the field attributes windows.

100
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,580
Incorrectly specifying a field attribute,

101
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,359
can make it impossible to run even the
simplest data analysis.

102
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,190
>> Once you input your data in SAS, you
can start running your data analysis.

103
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,330
SAS stores a copy of the data set and
whatever library you're working on,

104
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,430
and leaves your original data set file
intact.

105
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,370
That way you don't lose or

106
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,630
change the original data once you start
working on it.

107
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,370
>> One finally note, let's use point and
click to look at our data.

108
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,868
Notice that some cells just have a period
in place of a number,

109
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:45,830
this is SAS way of encoding missing data.

110
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,750
We'll return to this idea in future
modules.
