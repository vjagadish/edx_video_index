00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,800
[MUSIC]

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,730
Welcome back.

4
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,320
I'm Doctor Larry Chu.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,640
>> Hi and I'm Doctor Yneshya Tachinka.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,300
>> Now, in this segment we're going to
talk about a typical

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,620
day in cardiac anesthesia.

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,820
And also talking about the flow of a case,
what you can expect from beginning to end.

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,530
For the perioperative care for the patient
undergoing cardiac surgery.

10
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,280
So, let's start off.

11
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,160
A typical day in cardiac anesthesia, it
actually starts the day

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,650
before when you get pre-operative
assessment information on your patient.

13
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,710
Can you tell us really briefly about what
to expect there?

14
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,300
>> Of course.

15
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,640
So, you will meet your patient the night
before the surgery.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,910
When you will obtain the past medical
history,

17
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,200
review any work up that might have been
obtained, and get the consent form.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,000
Now, this process can be quite involved
depending on the complexity of the case.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,720
So make sure you allow yourself up to at
least an hour to complete this process.

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,060
And then you call your attending and
fellow to discuss the plan for

21
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,190
the next day,.

22
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,370
Which would include induction, conulation
plan, graft plan, and

23
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,430
possible need for TE.

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,170
>> And of course Doctor Renton Weidman's
done a great

25
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,700
module on preoperative assessment and
consent of the cardiac patient.

26
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,740
And that's in this course, and you'll get
that later.

27
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,810
So watch out for that episode later.

28
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,290
So we, we've done our, our prep work.

29
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,980
Now it's the day the beginning of the day,

30
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,880
and we need to get our room ready, setting
up for our case.

31
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,220
Tell me a little bit about that process.

32
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,030
When do you arrive?

33
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,490
What's involved?

34
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,400
>> Setting up the cardiac OR requires more
time and preparation for

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,920
other cases, so make sure you allow
yourself extra time to do so.

36
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,700
On average, arrive about an hour before
you are scheduled to see a patient.

37
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,770
Just to make sure you get your proper
medications, and set up the OR.

38
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,990
>> Excellent advice and again, I'll note
we have a great module on room setup.

39
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,430
So, watch out for later, too.

40
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,160
Many more details to follow.

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,830
The goal of this segment really, is to
give you an overview of the day.

42
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,130
So now, keeping going on the day.

43
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,390
Let's talk a little bit about meeting your
patient, and of course,

44
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,000
bringing back to the room for induction.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,115
>> You will meet your patient in a pre-op
area where you will place the large

46
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:51,400
pour IV and arterial line.

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,120
Then you will ensure that the surgical and
nursing staff are available before you

48
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,740
bring the patient back to the operating
room.

49
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,590
>> Okay, we're in the OR.

50
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,150
We're ready to induce.

51
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,370
Can we go and just push the Propofol now?

52
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,070
>> Not quite yet.

53
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,420
We have to make sure that all the proper
monitors are placed on the patient.

54
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,400
Make sure that the plan that you discussed
with the attending is still in effect.

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,835
And then you will induce the patient,

56
00:03:14,835 --> 00:03:18,900
taking into consideration particular
proper physiology.

57
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,360
And any aspects that might have been
discussed the night before.

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,410
>> Okay, perfect.

59
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,095
Now you mentioned some lines, an arterial
line,

60
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:31,790
an IV are there any other lines that we
may need for a cardiac anesthesia case?

61
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,190
>> So, depending on the particular
institution,

62
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,665
you may either place the arterial line in
the pre-op area or in the operating room.

63
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:43,550
At the Brigham Women's Hospital, we place
essential lines when we

64
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,610
bring the patient into the room and after
the induction.

65
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,170
But you can double-check regarding the
details regarding that

66
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,690
with your attending.

67
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,780
>> Okay, wonderful.

68
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,715
Any other lines that you need to place?

69
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:58,459
P-A catheters, continuous cardiac output
monitors, all the fancy stuff?

70
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,730
I imagine that might be dependent on your
patient.

71
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,180
>> Indeed, that's the case.

72
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,310
So, you may have to place the PA catheter,
but

73
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,020
again that's going to be dependent on the
particular surgery.

74
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,025
And particular part of the physiology that
you're dealing.

75
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:13,280
>> Okay.
So, let's say that you

76
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,525
did all the lines according to what you
discussed with your attending.

77
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:20,990
At this point in the case you know, this
is where, you know,

78
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:27,560
the you may want to do a transesophageal
echocardiography examination.

79
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,370
Tell me a little bit about that.

80
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,240
Do you do it in everybody?

81
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,930
Are there are certain patients you don't
want to do it in?

82
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,456
You know, what can the resident expect to
get out of this part of the case?

83
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:41,100
>> So the T-exam will be obtained on some
of

84
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,580
the patients depending on the type of
physiology and the surgical plan.

85
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,420
The T-exam is usually done by either the
attending or

86
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,460
the cardiac anesthesia fellow.

87
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,120
And things that they're looking for are
any particular valvular abnormalities and

88
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,800
LB function before we start the operation.

89
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,710
>> Okay, wonderful.

90
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,570
Now, can residents expect to achieve
competency?

91
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,620
Complete competency, in transesophageal
cardiography during their

92
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,920
initial cardiac anesthesial rotation?

93
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,640
>> Depending on the institution, and the
residency program,

94
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,810
there may be opportunities for the
residents to learn some of the TE skills.

95
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,490
However, I do not think there's enough
time to become completely competent in

96
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,110
this particular study.

97
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,690
>> Well that's what fellowship is for,
right?

98
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,855
>> Indeed.
>> [LAUGH] Okay, well now,

99
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:29,890
to do this surgery and access the heart,
we have to do a sternotomy.

100
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,883
Tell me a little about what are the
considerations to think about for

101
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:37,720
the resident at this point of the case,
when they're opening up the chest.

102
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,710
>> Sternotomy, main valve marked
humodynamic changes.

103
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,940
Depending on the particular institution,
you will administer a large dose opioid.

104
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,540
At the Brigham women's hospital, we
administer a large dose of fentanyl.

105
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,000
However, particular use of a drug and

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,950
a dose will have to be discussed with your
attending.

107
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,740
>> Great.

108
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,570
Now, let me ask you a question.

109
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,690
Are there any special considerations for
patients who are coming back for

110
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:09,050
repeat heart surgery in terms of this part
of the case, this sternotomy?

111
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,090
>> Patients who have had previous
sternotomy,

112
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,500
have increased risk of scarring that may
form between the heart and the sternum.

113
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,610
In those cases, you should have blood
products available in the room and

114
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,680
ready for immediate transfusion if needed
in a case of bleeding.

115
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,240
>> That's very important information.

116
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,560
I'm glad you mentioned it.

117
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,100
Let's talk a little bit about the next
phase, which is cardio pulmonary bypass.

118
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,010
And don't worry.

119
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,520
I know you're worried out there.

120
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,250
It's a complicated subject.

121
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:46,189
We have a great lecture coming in, in this
course on cardiopulmonary bypass.

122
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:50,620
But Anyeshka, can you please just tell me
the basic considerations that

123
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,150
residents should be aware of at this
point?

124
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,700
When we're preparing to put the patient
onto the cardiopulmonary bypass machine?

125
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,670
>> Of course.

126
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,490
Prior to going to bypass, there are a
couple of steps that you need to consider.

127
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,010
One is administration of Heparin.

128
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,020
The timing of the administration of
Heparin will have to be

129
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,660
discussed with the surgical team.

130
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,290
To make sure that we do not impede with
too much bleeding in the surgical field.

131
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,360
The dose of the Heparin will have to be
discussed with your attending and

132
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,480
the perfusionist team.

133
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,520
Cannulation will be done by the surgical
team.

134
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,500
And you'll have to pay a special attention
to make sure that the blood

135
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,360
pressure is not too markedly increased.

136
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,350
The goal of blood pressure at this stage
will have to be discussed between

137
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,970
surgical team and your attending, as well.

138
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,810
>> Wonderful.

139
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,090
So, now we have everything we need to get
the patient over on

140
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,650
cardiopulmonary bypass.

141
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,370
The patient is now in cardiopulmonary
bypass,

142
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,940
the surgeons are ready to do their
operation.

143
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,210
I think this would be a perfect time to go
and get a cup of coffee.

144
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,980
>> Not quite yet, Dr. Chu.

145
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,530
>> Oh.
>> We shall stay in the room and

146
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,808
make sure that we pay attention to the
patient and to the surgical field.

147
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:59,640
First, you're going to have to talk to the
perfusionist and make sure that

148
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,620
the patient is properly anesthetized
during this stage of the surgery.

149
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,420
Also, you will have to take a look and
make sure that the surgery is

150
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:12,000
going well to anticipate any possible
complications coming off of bypass.

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,350
Also, Society of Cardiovascular
Anesthesiologist recommends,

152
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:21,750
that a member of the anesthesiology team
stays in the operating room at all times.

153
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,470
>> Well, you know, I was being a little
facetious.

154
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,550
Of course anesthesia, we're very
important.

155
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,450
We need to be there at all times.

156
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,188
But now that the operation's over, okay.

157
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:37,830
We can now begin preparations to wean the
patient off of cardiopulmonary bypass.

158
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,650
In order to get their own heart working so

159
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,503
we can get them out of the operating, tell
me, operating room.

160
00:08:46,503 --> 00:08:49,370
Tell me a little bit about what that
involves.

161
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,430
>> Of course.
There are certain things that you have to

162
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,940
consider before taking the patient off of
bypass in a safe fashion.

163
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,860
These are, in general, making sure that a
patient has a normal temperature.

164
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,170
That the heart's rhythm and

165
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,980
rate are within normal limits, and assess
the need for possible pacing.

166
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,390
You have to make sure to remember to
ventilate a patient at this time.

167
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,390
Double check that the labs are within
normal limits in terms of

168
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,770
the electrolytes and hematocrit level.

169
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,140
And also, you have to consider if you need
any ionotrope assistance in order to

170
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,770
get the patient off of bypass at this
time.

171
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,550
>> Wonderful.

172
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,460
So, let, let's go ahead, we're, we're
ready, we're going to come off bypass.

173
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,540
Now, of course a couple more steps that
we're not going to go into detail now

174
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,220
about, but you have to decanulate or
remove the canulas.

175
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,190
You have to reverse the effects of your
anti-coagulation and

176
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,510
then it's closing time, right?

177
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,510
Now should we just expect that we can
extubate the patient on

178
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,315
the table,we're going to go get a cup of
coffee, and send the patient home?

179
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:52,780
>> No time for coffee just yet.

180
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,925
In our institution, we transfer the
patient up to the ICU intubated.

181
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:59,790
And you have to make sure that you take
with you all of

182
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,190
their resuscitation medications that you
may need.

183
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,870
To make sure that their trip to the ICU is
a safe one.

184
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,580
>> Wonderful.

185
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,130
So we're in the ICU, we dropped the
patient off,

186
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,990
now I can get my cup of coffee.

187
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,120
>> Not quite yet.

188
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,550
We have to make sure that the ICU team
feels comfortable taking care of

189
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,000
our patient during post-operative period.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,970
This requires the interdisciplinary sign
out, including the anesthesia and

191
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,310
surgical teams.

192
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,900
Making sure that we give information about
the patient's past medical history,

193
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,410
a brief overview of the operative course.

194
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,820
As well as any medications that the
patient is currently on.

195
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,050
>> Okay, wonderful.

196
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,697
Now, all you need, I'm going to get my
caffeine fix, and

197
00:10:37,697 --> 00:10:41,840
we've sent our patient off, and it's a
wonderful day.

198
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,376
>> [LAUGH] It has been a wonderful day,
but

199
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,550
we're always curious to see how the
patients are doing the day after.

200
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,730
And so, you should remember to take a look
at how the patient is

201
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,640
doing the day after the surgery.

202
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,330
And make sure that you

203
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,330
pay attention to any complications that
might have occurred.

204
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:55,840
>> Wonderful.

205
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,290
Well, I think this has been a great
segment.

206
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,360
I think you've learned a lot.

207
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,420
Just to recap what we learned this
segment.

208
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,320
We talked about how your day starts the
day before with your

209
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,760
preoperative assessment.

210
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,070
To make sure you call your attending the
night before to come up with a plan.

211
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,250
To on the day of the surgery to arrive
early, acc, allow for

212
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,960
about an hour of time to set up your room.

213
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,570
And then, of course, going through the
flow of a case.

214
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,750
From meeting your patient in a
pre-operative area

215
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,250
until dropping them off at the ICU.

216
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,190
To pay attention to all those different
steps and more importantly for

217
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,690
you as a resident, all those opportunities
for learning.

218
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,761
So, there's a lot more to share with you
in this course, and

219
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,819
we look forward to seeing you next time.

220
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:36,584
Bye!

221
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:37,777
>> Bye, good luck.

222
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:47,777
