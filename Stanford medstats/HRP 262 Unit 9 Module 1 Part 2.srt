[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,820
[SOUND]

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,040
So I've now talked about giving you an
overview of

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,290
three different ways to handle repeated
measures outcome data in SAS.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,910
And I thought it might be helpful for

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,230
me to just put this together in an
organized fashion into a chart for you.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,611
So you can run PROC GENMOD with a repeated
statement or

8
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:28,647
you could run PROC MIXED with a repeated
statement or

9
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:32,700
you could run PROC MIXED with a random
statement as I've alluded to.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,060
What are the differences between those
three approaches?

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,628
So, first of all,

12
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:42,970
PROC GENMOD is a procedure in SAS that
handles any type of outcome variable.

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,140
It doesn't have to be continuous normally
distributed.

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,790
It can also handle binary outcomes, count
outcomes, negative binomial.

15
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,640
All of those different types of outcomes.

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,950
So, PROC GENMOD is general in that way.

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,580
However, PROC GENMOD does not allow for
the inclusion of random effects.

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,280
So we are fitting marginal models.

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,410
We cannot get subject specific effects.

20
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,960
When in the repeated statement in PROC
GENMOD, you're going to have to specify

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,500
a type equals where you tell SAS what type
of covariance structure you want.

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,290
Whatever you put here, exchangeable, for
example, unstructured.

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,890
You are specifying the covariance
structure that you want for

24
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,230
what SAS calls the R matrix.

25
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,960
This is the covariance structure for the
residuals.

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,840
The within subject correlation over time.

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,800
So just realize that that's the
correlation that structure that you're

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,490
specifying in PROC GENMOD.

29
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,210
When you do PROC MIXED with a repeated
statement,

30
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,030
you are really doing something very
similar to PROC GENMOD with

31
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,170
a repeated statement.

32
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,698
Couple of differences, so PROC MIXED with
a repeated statement,

33
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:50,180
PROC mixed in SAS only handles continuous
roughly normally distributed outcomes.

34
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,830
We can only do linear models.

35
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,150
There are procedures in SASS that handle
other types of outcome data,

36
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,040
such as binary outcomes.

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,150
But those are PROCs that are beyond the
scope of this course.

38
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,270
So, PROC MIXED itself cannot handle
anything other than

39
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,230
continuously normally distributed
outcomes.

40
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,190
But if you're using the repeated statement
and Proc mixed,

41
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,300
that is not including any random effects
so you are still fitting a marginal model.

42
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,050
You are not going to get subject-specific
effects, and you're still

43
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,250
focusing on the covariant structure of the
residuals, what SAS calls the R matrix.

44
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,240
So that's what you're specifying when you
put this type equals for

45
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,340
the covariant structure.

46
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,490
So those, the first two are very similar.

47
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,330
I'll, I'll notice that one other thing
that I've mentioned is that

48
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:34,570
PROC MIXED with a repeated statement has
more choices for

49
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,570
the covariance structure of the r matrix.

50
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,120
So that is one slight difference there.

51
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,070
PROC MIXED with a random statement is
actually doing something quite different.

52
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,908
So PROC MIXED again, can only handle
continuous normally distributed outcomes.

53
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:51,272
Although there are are procedures in SAS
that will do mixed models for

54
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:53,320
other types of outcomes such as binary.

55
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,730
however, PROC MIXED with a random
statement is now including allowing you

56
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,040
to include random effects.

57
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,955
So that's really quite different because
now you can fit these

58
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:07,860
subject specific intercepts and slope
subjects, specific effects.

59
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,490
So when you put the type equals, when you
specify the covariant structure,

60
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,530
the covariant structure that you have to
specify for

61
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,950
the random statement is not the covariant
structure for the R matrix.

62
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,550
It's the co-variant structure for what SAS
calls that G matrix.

63
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,942
This is just the co-variance matrix for
the random effects and

64
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:27,846
it usually involves very few parameters,
you might just have the,

65
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:30,662
correlation between the intercept and the
slope for

66
00:03:30,662 --> 00:03:35,030
example, those random effects, so I
usually just set that to be unstructured.

67
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,845
So you have, you don't have to worry so

68
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:41,700
much about exactly the covariant structure
when you're including a random statement.

69
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,440
The other thing I want to point out is
that if you're in PROC MIXED,

70
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,140
you can included a random statement and
also include a repeated statement.

71
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,590
As I mentioned before, you usually don't
need to also include a repeated statement,

72
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,690
but SAS will allow you to do it.

73
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,500
You can also include multiple random
statements.

74
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,956
So for example you could include, if you
had a study where you had

75
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:05,244
repeated observations on subjects, and
then, but then the subjects were also

76
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:09,916
clustered in some way, so maybe clustered
within clinic or clustered within school,

77
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:14,140
you could include random effects for this
subject as well as random effects for

78
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,710
the clinic or random effects for the
school.

79
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:21,030
So you're allowed to include multiple
random statements in PROC Mixed.

80
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,240
With Proc GENMOD, you can only include one
repeated statement and

81
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,740
with PROC Mix, you can only include one
repeated statement.

82
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,390
So you can't include multiple repeated
statements.

83
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,343
So there tends to be some, some Datasets
that PROC MIXED with a random statement

84
00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:38,355
will just handle more easily, because you,
the fact that you can include random

85
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:42,440
effects for multiple layers of clustering,
what we call multilevel models.

86
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,210
So that's just kind of to set up

87
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,420
the differences between those three PROCs
for you.

88
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,880
And then I thought it would be really
helpful for you to really understand

89
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,850
the difference between the marginal models
and the subject-specific models.

90
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,560
The easiest way to understand that is with
a picture.

91
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,240
So I thought it would be worth me drawing
some pictures here.

92
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,090
I'm going to go back to the same spine
bone density example that we've been

93
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,030
using because you're all very familiar
with this example by now.

94
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,270
So this is looking at three different
groups.

95
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,200
Their bone density changes over time.

96
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,419
I've shown you these pictures several
times.

97
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:14,109
I went ahead and took these data on these
41 women and

98
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:16,820
I fit the data in three different ways.

99
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,140
I used proc mix for the random statement,
proc mix for the repeated statement and

100
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,760
proc mixed, and proc/ gen mod with a
repeated statement - a GE model.

101
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,200
And I want to show you, I then asked SAS
to output for

102
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,810
me the predicted values for each person in
my data set, from each of those models.

103
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,050
Those predicted values, where,

104
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,440
you'll see, when we graft them, that they
are very informative.

105
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,890
So I'm going to start with the predicted
model,

106
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,850
when I did prop mixed with a random
statement.

107
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,190
I'm actually going to show you the code
here, just to show you what it looks like.

108
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,280
You can see I included a random statement.

109
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,910
I, I'm allowing random ess, effects for
subjects.

110
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,310
A random intercept, and random slopes.

111
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,170
And I haven't told you exactly what those
are yet.

112
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,210
But we're going to get to that in the next
module.

113
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,490
But the key is that if you look over at
the pic,

114
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,680
picture what I've graphed here are
predicted values for each subject.

115
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,640
So SAS calculates for me the predicted
spine bone density at each time point for

116
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,650
each subject based on this model, this
fitted model.

117
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,246
I went ahead and plotted those and you can
see that different subjects have

118
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:19,370
different intercepts and different
subjects have different changes over time.

119
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,320
There is a lot of subject-specific
variability here.

120
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,568
I then super-imposed linear regression
lines because we fit time is linear

121
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:32,740
here and we allowed the changes over time
to vary by which group you're in.

122
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,490
So we've got time group and group by time
in the model.

123
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,640
And there is three groups here.

124
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,660
The red and black groups you can see in
our fitted model have very similar slopes

125
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,190
and the control group has as we saw from
the observed values, it's pretty flat or

126
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,360
goes down a little bit over time.

127
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,100
So, this is the, the fitted model.

128
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,210
These are the predicted values.

129
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,280
This is the model that we just fit.

130
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,390
But see that subject specific variability.

131
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,350
I'm also showing you the code for

132
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,160
how to plot this in case you want to know
how to do it.

133
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,210
That's what it means to have a random
statement in the model.

134
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,820
Okay?
So contrast that to the following.

135
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,170
I then went ahead and

136
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:09,020
fit a proc mixed with a repeated statement
on this exact same data, exact same model.

137
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,730
Here are the predicted values from that
model.

138
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,730
So what do you notice?

139
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,380
These again are the predicted values for
each individual at each time point.

140
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,400
What you notice is there are no subject
specific variability.

141
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,520
If somebody is in the red group, they are
predicted to be right on that line for

142
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,310
the rate of change in the bone density
over time.

143
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,324
So we get the same general lines, I mean
the,

144
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:33,508
the scales are a little different here
because this is only showing .92 to 1.02.

145
00:07:33,508 --> 00:07:36,588
Over here we're seeing a wider range
because it's showing you all

146
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:38,238
that individual variability, but

147
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:42,570
if you look just at those three lines, the
three lines look pretty much the same.

148
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,030
So, that's what we end up really caring
about is what is the slope for

149
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,880
each of the different groups and those are
basically the same.

150
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,890
Red and black are largely overlapping and
blue is lower than the other two.

151
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,790
However, what's different here is there is
no subject specific variability allowed,

152
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,044
so this is what we mean by a marginal
model or a population average model.

153
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:04,890
If you're the red group, you're predicted
to be on one line, and that's it.

154
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,960
And that's the difference between having a
random statement, and

155
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,830
having a repeated statement in proc mixed.

156
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,350
This is fitting a marginal model.

157
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,050
I went ahead and then chipped those same
data, and put them into proc genmod with

158
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,960
a repeated statement, essentially fit a
generalized estimating equation.

159
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,818
And when I did that, I get pretty much the
same model that I

160
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:25,700
got from PROC mixed with a repeated
statement.

161
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,340
So again, it's fitting a marginal model.

162
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,570
Everybody is forced to be on one of those
lines.

163
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,690
If you're in the red group, everybody in
the red group is on the same line.

164
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,990
Everybody on the black group is on the
same line.

165
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,790
So the only variation we're allowed is
because we have group in,

166
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,810
group by time in the, in the model.

167
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,770
We're not allowed any subject-specific
variation.

168
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,661
And that's the difference between the, the
picture really shows you

169
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:49,100
the difference between the marginal model
and the model with random effects in it.

170
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,799
