1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,625
Now, expected value is an extremely useful
concept for good decision-making.

2
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:06,679
So let's start here,

3
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:11,788
let's go back to the lottery example which
we started to talk about last week.

4
00:00:11,788 --> 00:00:13,876
The lottery has also been called a,

5
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:19,980
a tax on people who are bad at math and I
tend to agree with that view point.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,710
I'm not saying lotteries are bad because
most lotteries also go,

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,579
some of the revenue goes to pay for things
like schools and parks.

8
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:31,414
But I'm usually not willing to pay that
tax myself,

9
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:32,989
because if you do out the math,

10
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:39,862
the lottery is not really a great deal you
know, there's good reasons not to play.

11
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:41,623
And remember, we saw the lottery last
week.

12
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:45,439
A particular lottery works by picking six
numbers from 1 to 49.

13
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,572
You have to punch off six numbers from 1
to 49.

14
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:50,635
We last week just talked about the
probability of winning.

15
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:53,190
But let's put some dollar figures to that,
today.

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,270
So if it costs a dollar to play the
lottery, and let's say,

17
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,190
on a particular week, the winnings after
taxes are $2 million.

18
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,600
If you play the lottery once, what are
your expected either winnings or loses?

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,610
In other words, what's your expected value
here?

20
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,050
Well, we can calculate an expected value
to answer the question of whether or

21
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,810
not it's a good idea to play the lottery.

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,000
So, again, we calculated the probability
of winning last week.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,170
So what's the probability of winning the
lotto, lottery?

24
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,060
Well, this particular lottery, there's 49
numbers, so there

25
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,870
are 49 choose six possible combinations
that turns out to be about 14 million.

26
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:34,180
So your chances if you play one ticket of
winning the lottery are 1 in 14 million.

27
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,968
We saw that that's the combination
function we, we saw last week.

28
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:41,940
Well, now we can think about this in a
probability as a probability distribution.

29
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,320
There's only two possible outcomes here.

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,900
You either win or you lose.

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,000
So let's write out the probability
function.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,090
So your two possible outcomes in dollar
values are you either lose a dollar, so

33
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,761
negative 1, or you win $2 million, so
positive 2 million.

34
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:58,320
The probability associated with each of
those dollar outcomes is

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,834
the probability of losing a dollar is
0.999999928.

36
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:08,950
The probability of winning $2 million is
2.2 time 10 the negative 8.

37
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,790
We can use that probability function to
calculate an expected value here.

38
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,000
So lets do that.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,612
So how would we calculate expected value?

40
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:18,835
We're going to take each x and multiply it
by its probability, and then add those up.

41
00:02:18,835 --> 00:02:20,530
So, that's easy to do here.

42
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,770
Take the negative 1,

43
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:28,509
multiply it by this very, very close to 1
probability, 0.999999928.

44
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:30,440
Take the $2 million, and

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,750
multiply it by the chance of winning, the
7.2 times 10 to the negative 8.

46
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,260
When you do that and add that all up,

47
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,590
it turns out to be that your expected
value is negative 0.86 cents.

48
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,110
In other words, you're expected to lose
money.

49
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:50,850
So in general, if your negative value is
expected, it's not a good idea to play.

50
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,060
If you expect to lose money, it's not a
really good investment for you.

51
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,260
And you might think well cents 0.86, well
yeah,

52
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,220
doesn't sound so bad, but of course, we
can project this over the long run.

53
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,230
On average, for every time you play you
expect to lose $0.86, so if you play every

54
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,900
week for ten years 520 times you're
expecting to lose even more than that.

55
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,610
You're expecting to lose, you know, $447
and

56
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,870
you get the idea, on average, you're
expecting to lose and that increments.

57
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,942
The more you play, the more that adds up,
the more that you lose.

58
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:27,680
Now of course, some people have argued to
me that

59
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,980
the lottery has some immeasurable values
that we're not factoring in here.

60
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,320
Right.
So for for some people, the excitement of

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,238
playing the lottery might be worth that
value, that dollar a week to them.

62
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:43,120
It's certainly less than we spend on a lot
of people spend on coffees and things.

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,480
So, so maybe there's some intrinsic
psychological benefit that people get out

64
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,292
of the lottery.

65
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:52,499
I probably wouldn't get that benefit since
I'm positive that I'm going to lose so.

66
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,128
Now, let's get back to the Mega Millions
jackpot that I mentioned in the teaser.

67
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:05,340
So in 2012, the Mega Millions lottery had
gotten up to a record jackpot,

68
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,800
the biggest ever, of $656 million.

69
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,240
So this means that there have probably
been a number of weeks that had gone by in

70
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,725
this particular lottery, where nobody had
won, and so the pot had built up.

71
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:21,900
And, your choice when you have you know,
when you win the lottery is to take the,

72
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,070
or that amount and, and get it distributed
to you over, say, 30 years.

73
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,190
Or you can get an immediate payout and you
take, you know, you get a lot less, but

74
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,440
you get it right away.

75
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,270
And so that the immediate payout here was
going to be around 474 million.

76
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,070
So somebody had emailed me and said the
following.

77
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,250
If the odds of winning the Mega Millions
is 1 in 175 million,

78
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,900
and we're going to assume that those odds
are correct because it's right from

79
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,430
the Mega Millions website, and

80
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,420
notice that this lottery has a lot worse
odds than the one we just calculated.

81
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,880
That's because there's more possible
numbers involved in this one.

82
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,210
But if the odds is 1 in 175 million, is
there

83
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,710
a significant statistical advantage in
playing a hundred tickets rather than one.

84
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,010
For a half billion with a B dollars, it
almost seems worth it, this person said.

85
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,770
So they wanted to know well the jackpot
gets so

86
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,060
huge does it make suddenly worth it to
play and

87
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,750
even to play a larger number of tickets so
that you increase your chances of winning.

88
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,670
So let's look at this as an expected value
problem.

89
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,470
So we can calculate the expected.

90
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,250
Let's start with the expected value for
one ticket.

91
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,610
So what's your chance of winning?

92
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,430
It's 1 in 175 million.

93
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,510
What's your chance of losing?

94
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:45,402
It's 1 minus 1 in 175 million or
99.9999994%.

95
00:05:45,402 --> 00:05:48,490
So, we can do other probability
distribution here.

96
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,540
So, in this case, it still costs a dollar
to lose, but now,

97
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,890
the jackpot is 500 million.

98
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,350
Our probability of winning is 6 6 times 10
to the negative 9.

99
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,498
I just converted the negative 99.9999994
to make it easier to write up.

100
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:05,040
Oh, sorry, 1 minus the,

101
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,244
if you do 1 minus the 0.999999994, you get
this 6 times 10 to the negative 9th.

102
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:13,270
So [INAUDIBLE] the expected value.

103
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,465
So X times the probability of X, add those
up,

104
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:22,600
we get interestingly enough, because the
jackpot is so humongous here.

105
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,475
You get a positive expected value which is
a very unusual thing in a lottery.

106
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:30,800
So you get a positive expected value of
$2.

107
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,960
That's very interesting, because usually
from lottery problems,

108
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,240
the expected value comes out negative.

109
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,840
So let's continue on with the question
that the person who emailed me had asked,

110
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,585
what about if we do this for a 100
tickets?

111
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:45,040
We're going to have to increase our
expected value,

112
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,480
increase our chances of winning.

113
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,170
We're certainly going to increase our
chances of winning somewhat by a hundred,

114
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:49,810
buying a hundred tickets.

115
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,720
What will that do to our expected value?

116
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,620
So first of all,

117
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,430
let's calculate the chance that you will
lose if you buy a hundred tickets.

118
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,300
So, what's your chance of losing if you
buy one ticket?

119
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,900
Your chance of losing is 1 minus 1 over a
175 million.

120
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,460
Your chance of winning is 1 over
175,000,000; therefore,

121
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,030
your chance of losing is 1 minus that.

122
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,820
That's your chance of losing with one
ticket.

123
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,080
Now, if you buy a hundred tickets, the
chance of losing is that you have to,

124
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,754
that has to occur, your loss has to occur
hundred times.

125
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:24,526
A hundred tickets have to not work, work
out, so you have to raise this to 100.

126
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:30,190
So, 1 minus 1 over 175 million raised to
100 that's

127
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,560
how you calculate the probability of
losing with a hundred tickets.

128
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,800
And that turns out to be it's still a
really,

129
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,026
really high probability of losing, turns
out to be 99.999943%.

130
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,282
So a really, really high chance still that
you

131
00:07:42,282 --> 00:07:46,682
will lose with even with a hundred tickets
not surprisingly.

132
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:49,690
Let's calculate the expected value now.

133
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,670
So here's the probability distribution,
you're either going to lose a dollar or

134
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,030
win 500 million and here's the
probability.

135
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,976
So, the probability of winning is
0.99999943, so

136
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:05,510
your probability of losing is sorry, your
probability of losing is 0.99999943,

137
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,510
so your probability is 1 minus that, which
is 5.7 times 10 to the negative 7.

138
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:16,950
So if I subtract 0.99999943 from 1, you
get 5.7 times 10 to the negative 7.

139
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,916
So, a very small chance, still, of
winning.

140
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:23,090
Let's calculate out, lay out the expected
value then.

141
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,430
So let's do the expected value.

142
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,060
So, if I calculate the expected value
here.

143
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,838
Interestingly, it comes out to be an
expected value of 284.

144
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:32,940
Well, that's pretty good.

145
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,280
Because it's a positive.

146
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,250
And, you know, it's a decent amount of
money.

147
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,550
So, one could make the case just looking
at that for maybe for playing.

148
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,290
Now, you're still virtually guaranteed to
lose, right?

149
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,230
Your chance of losing is really, really
high.

150
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,230
But, based just on those things, one can
make a case for playing.

151
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,680
And you can actually work out that the
expected payout only has to

152
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,870
be greater than 176 million for

153
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,600
this particular lottery for the expected
value to be positive.

154
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,870
So, as long as the, the, the lottery
jackpot is greater than 176 million.

155
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,380
Based on the little calculation we've done
so

156
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,800
far, the expected value is going to be
positive.

157
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,310
Of course, there's a but in this.

158
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:15,160
So we got to go a little further, because
there's more to it than this.

159
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
What we haven't considered yet

160
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,850
is that the chance that there could be
multiple winners.

161
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,840
Now, usually, in any given week, the
chance of multiple winners is

162
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,440
pretty small, because the chance, you
know, of one person winning is small,

163
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,390
the chance of two people getting the same
number is small, it does happen sometimes.

164
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,950
But, think about what happens when the
jackpot is huge, it gets, it was,

165
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,370
you know, hugely covered in the media, so

166
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,350
all of a sudden everybody hears about it
and lots of people play.

167
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,730
So when you have lots and lots of people
playing the lottery.

168
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,410
Even though, there is 175 million
different combinations that

169
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,550
are possible when more than 175 million
people play that lottery,

170
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,730
actually, you start to get into having a
high probability of multiple winners.

171
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,300
And multiple winners have to share, have
to split the jackpot.

172
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,970
So it turns out, I went back and tried to
figure out for that

173
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,368
particular Mega Millions lottery, when the
jackpot had gotten up to 656 million.

174
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:13,130
I've been trying to figure out how many
people actually played,

175
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,270
how many tickets were sold?

176
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,800
I did't find that easily on Google.

177
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,140
But I found some data on the Mega Millions
website which showed how many

178
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,220
people won all of the different possible
prizes, so there's the jackpot and

179
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,920
then there's a whole bunch of smaller
prizes people could win.

180
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,760
And I'm able to estimate to make a pretty
good ballpark estimate that

181
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,020
based on those, the, the number of people
who won those things.

182
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,210
That there are probably about 600 million
tickets sold somewhere in

183
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,720
that ballpark is a rough estimate but 600
million tickets sold.

184
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,576
There are only 175 million different,

185
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,768
only [LAUGH] 175 million different
combinations.

186
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:51,556
So suddenly, you're realizing that a lot
of combinations got played,

187
00:10:51,556 --> 00:10:54,244
had to have been played multiple times.

188
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:58,270
And that means there's actually a high,
high chance of multiple winners here.

189
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,730
So what I've done out here is I figured
out the probability distribution for

190
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,640
the number of winners.

191
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,193
So X here is the number of winners for
this record, jackpot Mega Millions,

192
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:14,736
assuming that 600 million tickets were
sold, here's how many winners we expect.

193
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:19,900
So the way that I calculated out these
probabilities is,

194
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,520
actually, I treated this as a binomial
distribution, and

195
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,260
we're going to be talking about the
binomial distribution in just two modules.

196
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,050
So tuck that in the back of your head that
the way that I as able to

197
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,470
figure this out was a binomial
distribution.

198
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,620
It turns out that the probability of,

199
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,028
of having no winners when you have 600
million tickets played is only 3%.

200
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:40,341
The probability of having only a single
winner is 11%.

201
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:42,370
The probability of having two winners is
19%.

202
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,810
The probability of having three winners is
22%,

203
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,440
and you can see all the probabilities, and
I only went out to 10.

204
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,530
By the time you've got the probability of
having ten winners at once,

205
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,870
that was a pretty small probabilities.

206
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,610
The probability of 11 or more those
probabilities were essentially negligible

207
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,860
because they were so small, so I didn't
bother to keep going.

208
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,680
Well, we can calculate the expected value
of

209
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,570
number of winners here using this
probability distribution.

210
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,460
So I take each value, X and multiply it by
its probability.

211
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,540
Add those up, you come out with that the
expected number of winners,

212
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,230
if 600 million people play or if 600
million tickets are played is 3.4.

213
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,790
And, so you're actually expecting multiple
winners.

214
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,695
And in fact, it turns out that in this
Mega Millions,

215
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:32,800
particular Mega Millions week, in the
lottery,

216
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,248
there were actually three winners, so the
expected value bore out just perfectly.

217
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:42,800
So, the expected winnings isn't really 500
million here, because we were expecting

218
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,670
to split the pot by with 3.4 people or 3.4
people are expected to split the pot.

219
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:54,310
So if you divide the 500 million by 3.4,
it's roughly somewhere around 150 million

220
00:12:54,310 --> 00:13:00,290
that you're actually expecting to win,
while that 147 million puts

221
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:05,750
us below the figure of 176 million that's
needed to have a positive expected value.

222
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,690
So when you factor in the chance of
multiple winners it turns out that, now,

223
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,440
we're back into that negative territory
for

224
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,140
expected value and I haven't in factored
in taxes either.

225
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,870
I think about half of the lottery winnings
get siphoned off

226
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,840
by the federal government and state
government for taxes.

227
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,830
So that would put our total down to a
jackpot of only $75 million,

228
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,050
which will clearly keep us in the negative
range for expected value.

229
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,025
So just based on expected value, then it
wouldn't be worth playing.

230
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:41,880
And regardless of expected value, the fact
is you're still almost guaranteed to

231
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,895
lose with near certainty, because the
probability of losing is so, so, so high.

232
00:13:45,895 --> 00:13:48,958
So that's just a fun little problem.

233
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:55,410
Now, another great example of expected
value is to talk about gambling.

234
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,160
And I think gambling is like the greatest
business model.

235
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,000
Because, it's completely set up to
guarantee that the casino will make money.

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,850
And so it's just a great, guaranteed way
to make money, and we can show that.

237
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,320
So, so how does gambling work?

238
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,640
Let me just give you a particular thing
you might encounter in a casino,

239
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,210
a roulette wheel.

240
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,440
Most people are familiar with the roulette
wheel.

241
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,515
So the roulette wheel has the numbers from
1 to 36, as well as 0 and 00.

242
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:26,260
And you get to bet on one of those you get
to bet on, let's say,

243
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,441
you can bet that an odd number will come
up.

244
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:33,784
And if you bet, let's say you bet a dollar
that an odd number will come up.

245
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:35,829
You will win a dollar if the odd number
comes up.

246
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:37,607
You will lose a dollar if the odd number
doesn't come up.

247
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:40,922
Now because 0 and 00 are counted as even
numbers, you have,

248
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:45,388
there are 18 odd numbers but there are 20
even numbers.

249
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:48,732
So, you have an 18 out of 38 chance of
winning a dollar,

250
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:53,602
you have a 20 out of 38 chance of losing a
dollar.

251
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,942
So, unlike the lottery now, the chances of
winning and

252
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:59,917
losing are purposely stacked up to be
pretty close to one another.

253
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:02,311
But if that's the probability
distribution,

254
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:05,234
what's the expected value going to be
here?

255
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:06,235
Well, we can calculate that.

256
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:10,655
So the expected value is you win a dollar
with probability 18 out of 30, you lose

257
00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:17,470
a dollar with 20 out of 38 probability, so
your expected value is negative cents.

258
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,480
Now, what's neat about gambling is that
they've set

259
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,359
the probabilities close enough that
sometimes you're definitely going to win.

260
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,018
If you play a couple, enough times, you're
definitely going to win sometimes.

261
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:32,640
So that, of course, is what hooks people
in.

262
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,780
You have to win enough to hook you in.

263
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,560
You have to let people win enough so they
get hooked in.

264
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,220
But on average, if you play over a long
time, and for

265
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,070
every game you play, you lose about a
nickel.

266
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,450
So, on average, the casino is guaranteed
over the long run to win money.

267
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,290
And of course, if the stakes are higher,
the dollar amounts get higher.

268
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,820
So, if it was a $10 game, then the
expected value is negative 53 cents for

269
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,060
the player, which we use positive 53 cents
for the casino.

270
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:06,462
And let's imagine that the casino played
10,000 games in a night,

271
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:09,380
it's winning an average of 53 cents per
game,

272
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,170
that means it takes in $5,300 a night just
from the roulette wheel.

273
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,805
So you can see that this is a fantastic
business model,

274
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:19,060
because the casino, just based on expected
value and

275
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,855
statistics, knows that over the long run
is going to keep raking in money.

276
00:16:22,855 --> 00:16:24,750
And of course,

277
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,090
that means the player over the long run is
going to keep shedding money.

278
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,820
Now, we're turning to the challenge
problem that I set out as one of

279
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,440
the teasers for the week.

280
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,900
So this problem was, you're in a resource
poor area, and

281
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,610
you want to screen the population for some
disease.

282
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,950
But the antibody test is fairly expensive
and you don't have enough money to pay for

283
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,290
antibody tests for everybody.

284
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,290
So people have come up with a clever
cost-saving strategy,

285
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,940
which is to pool the blood from multiple
samples.

286
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,560
So, for every person who comes in and

287
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,210
gets the test, gets their blood drawn, you
set aside half of their blood.

288
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,630
You take the other half of their blood and

289
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,670
you pool it into a, pooled lot of say n
people.

290
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,440
If the pooled lot is negative, so assuming
that the antibody test is

291
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,010
sensitive enough that it will pick up any
virus.

292
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,120
And anybody has the virus, so

293
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,870
if it comes back negative, that means that
nobody has the virus.

294
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,200
If you can get the pooled lot,

295
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,490
if that's negative, you don't have to run
anymore tests on those people because you

296
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,110
know that everybody that you included in
the pool is negative.

297
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,500
So, that saves you n minus 1 tests.

298
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,530
Of course, if that pool blood comes out to
be positive.

299
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,480
Then you do have to go back to the
original individual samples, and

300
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,800
test everybody, to figure out who it is
that has the disease.

301
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,610
That will require you n plus 1 tests.

302
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,655
So you have to, you end up having to do an
extra test.

303
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:44,010
So if a particular disease has a
prevalence of 10% in a population.

304
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,500
Is this a good case?

305
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,010
Is that, is that rare enough that the
pooling strategy will work?

306
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,930
Of course, if the disease prevalence gets
too high,

307
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:55,090
then there's not going to be enough
negative lots when you pool people.

308
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,670
So will this pooling strategy work?

309
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,540
And if so, what's the optimal number of
samples to pool for lot?

310
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,450
What's the end here?

311
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,140
How many people should I put?

312
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,100
Did I pool together?

313
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:09,120
You don't want to pool too many, because
then the chance of the the pooled lot

314
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,780
coming back negative will be too small
that you won't save many antibody tests.

315
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,680
So there's a couple of ways you can solve
this.

316
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,180
You could if you want, and this is a great
thing for

317
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,630
those of you who really want to be
challenged in this course.

318
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,960
You could solve this very elegantly by
writing out

319
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,040
an elegant general solution and solving
for an optimum.

320
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,120
I'm actually not going to solve it that
way.

321
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,280
I'm going to just solve it with brute
force.

322
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,740
I'm just going to try a bunch of things
and

323
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,830
will eventually arrive at the right
answer.

324
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,270
Actually, brute-force is a really good
way,

325
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,920
even if you want to find out an elegant
solution.

326
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,710
Usually, it's a good idea to start with
the brute-force solution, and then,

327
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,390
the elegant solution will kind of
materialize out of that.

328
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,750
So you, at the end of this, you might
want to write down and

329
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,670
figure out the elegant solution.

330
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,180
And I'm also going to just assume that we
want to screen 100 people and

331
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,480
I'm just picking 100 because it's a nice
even number remember sometimes if you

332
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,990
pick 100 it just makes things easy to deal
with whole numbers.

333
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,190
So I'm just going to assume we want to
screen 100 people it doesn't matter how

334
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,990
many we're screening it will, this will
generalize.

335
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,120
So let's just try something.

336
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,000
We'll say, well, what if we wanted to pool
20 people it, 20 people's blood.

337
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,890
Will that save us antibody tests?

338
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,490
So, let's start there.

339
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,955
So, how do we solve this one?

340
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:27,050
So again, the prevalence of the disease is
10%.

341
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,187
And, we want to pool we're going to try
and see what would happen if we pooled 20

342
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:36,335
samples at a time, that we use, it says
we're starting with a 100 people,

343
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:41,467
100 samples, that mean's we'll have five
lots.

344
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:46,110
How, how many tests are we expected to
have to write, and again, we're

345
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,370
assuming that the test is perfect, the
sensitivity specificity is perfect here.

346
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,940
So we can calculate the expected value
problem.

347
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,415
We can calculate the expected number of
tests here.

348
00:19:55,415 --> 00:20:00,095
So we'll kind of call X is equal to the
number of tests that we're

349
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:00,660
going to have to run.

350
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,460
And actually, in this case, X can only
take on two possible values.

351
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,200
You're either going to run one test.

352
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,340
That's when it comes out negative.

353
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,340
Or, you're going to have to run 21 test.

354
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,410
So, if you have a pool lot of 20 and that
one comes out positive, you have to go

355
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,610
back and run all the tests on all 20 of
those samples, plus the initial test is 1.

356
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,145
So, you're either ending up running 1 test
if the pool lot comes up negative or

357
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:31,060
21 tests if the pool lot comes out
positive.

358
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,940
Then we need to figure out, so

359
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,400
we'll call that, it might be nice to put
this in a nice little probability chart,

360
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,910
so here's our two possible outcomes, 1
test or 21 tests.

361
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,670
And then, we need to figure out the
probability of each of those outcomes.

362
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:49,890
So what's the probability that that pooled
lot is going to come back negative, okay?

363
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,164
So you have to think again, the prevalence
of the disease here is 10%.

364
00:20:54,164 --> 00:21:01,210
[SOUND] What that means is that of any
given person,

365
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,530
a random person, has a 10% chance of
having the disease.

366
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,150
That means they have a 90% chance of not
having the disease.

367
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,901
In order for the pooled lot to come back
negative in this case,

368
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:16,439
we have to have 20 people in a row who
come back negative.

369
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:19,750
So, every person has a 0.9 chance of being
negative,

370
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,118
we have to have 20 of those in a row.

371
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:29,748
So it's 0.9 raised to the 20th.

372
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:39,540
That's the probability that the pooled

373
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,040
lot will come out to be negative, if you
calculate that out, that's a probability

374
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,540
of 12.2%. So not super high that we're
going to get a negative, and the negative

375
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,040
of course, is what we want here. What's
the probability that the pooled lot is

376
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,730
going to come out positive?
Well, that's just going to be 1 minus

377
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:48,060
the chance of it coming out negative.
So 1 minus 0.9 to the 20th and

378
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,680
that comes out to be 87.8%.

379
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,530
So that's our probability distribution,
and then,

380
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:57,942
we can calculate the expected value.
So the expected value here is going to be

381
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:07,234
12.2 % times 1 plus 87.8

382
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:12,610
% times 21.
Each x, multiplied by its probability,

383
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,010
add those up.
It turns out that

384
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,080
the expected value is 18.56.

385
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,624
Again, I'm, I'm going to, I'm going to say
what would happen for

386
00:22:19,624 --> 00:22:23,228
a hundred samples just so we can compare
across different pooling strategies and

387
00:22:23,228 --> 00:22:26,278
had make it easy to compare.
So

388
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:31,218
if we want to do a 100 samples total and
it's 18.56 per lot, then we have 5 lots,

389
00:22:31,218 --> 00:22:35,082
we have to multiply by 5 here.

390
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:37,278
So that tells us that per lot, per 20
people,

391
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:42,071
we have to run 18.56 tests on average.
That means per 100 people,

392
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:45,509
we have to run 92.8 tests on average.

393
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:47,248
Now, if we hadn't done any pooling
strategy,

394
00:22:47,248 --> 00:22:51,085
we would have had to run 100 tests.
So, we are saving ourselves on

395
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:54,081
average about seven antibody tests.

396
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,343
It's not a great savings here.
So, but we can, the pooling strategy does

397
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,907
do something here.

398
00:22:58,907 --> 00:23:00,690
So we, we answered the first question.

399
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,690
We know the pooling strategy is going to
be effective here, but

400
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,150
is 20 the optimal number?

401
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,820
Well, it seems like we could do better so
let's try just, you know,

402
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,440
again I'm doing this brute force.
So let's try what would the probability be

403
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,010
if I wanted to pool say, 10 at a time?

404
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,750
So pooling 20, that'is the answer.
As I wrote out on the last screen but

405
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,240
what about pooling ten?
What if you

406
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,370
pool only ten samples at a time?

407
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,930
How would that change things?
Well, it's basically the same problem and

408
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:27,800
the same logic.

409
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,950
So now, the expected value is going to be,
there's going to be,

410
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,940
you're either running one test now or
you're running 11 tests.

411
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,880
You have a 0.9 raised to the 10 chance of
the lot coming out negative, so

412
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,307
you have that much chance of have, running
one test.

413
00:23:42,307 --> 00:23:47,000
1 minus that is your chance of having to
run 11 tests.

414
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
And if you add that up,

415
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,690
you end up with that there are 7.5 tests
expected on average per lot,

416
00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,260
and of course if we're pooling ten,
that's, that's 7.5 tests per lot.

417
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,200
But, remember, we have 100 people total
here, so

418
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,610
there's going to be ten lots total.

419
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,040
So we have to multiply that by 10 by 10
lots, so

420
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,830
we'd end up running 75 antibody tests for
those 100 people.

421
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,098
Compare that to what we just calculated
for 20.

422
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:17,064
For pooling 20, it was 93, we've got it
down to 75.

423
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:20,080
So we're pooling fewer people is helping
us out.

424
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,850
Well, let's keep going.

425
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:24,015
What about if we pulled 5, pull 5 people
at a time?

426
00:24:24,015 --> 00:24:24,669
Same logic.

427
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:26,337
Now you get the pattern.

428
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:29,753
So it's going to be 0.9 raised to the
five, 5th times 1 plus 1 minus .9

429
00:24:29,753 --> 00:24:33,718
raised to the 5th, that's the chance of
your getting the positive now, times 6,

430
00:24:33,718 --> 00:24:40,462
because if we are going to get positive we
are going to have 5 plus 1 tests.

431
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:43,998
Now, we are going to end up running about
3.05 tests per lot, but

432
00:24:43,998 --> 00:24:48,922
we have to do 20 lots, [SOUND] because we
got 100 people total.

433
00:24:48,922 --> 00:24:50,656
So we end up with running only 61 tests,
so

434
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,498
we're still gaining as we're going down
here.

435
00:24:53,498 --> 00:24:55,660
Well, let's go down, now, we're really
getting close to,

436
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,040
to pooling, you know, down to one, we're,
so let's go down increment by one here.

437
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,401
What if we pooled 4 together?

438
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:05,689
So actually, it turns out that the optimum
is at 4, so when you calculate for 4,

439
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:11,160
it turns out that you would end up using
59 antibody tests.

440
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,790
You would expect to use 59 antibody tests.

441
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:17,530
Now, remember, this is, otherwise, you'd
have to use 100 if you didn't pool at all.

442
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,340
So this is saving you almost half of the
antibody tests.

443
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,802
This is for the when you have a disease
prevalence of 10%.

444
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:26,206
So pooling 4 is the optimum, you can keep
going and

445
00:25:26,206 --> 00:25:29,560
show that pooling 3 actually gets you back
up to 60 tests.

446
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,500
So the optimum is hit at 4.

447
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,090
Now again, there's a more elegant way to
solve this.

448
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,570
You could write out a general equation and
solve it, and

449
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,530
you could find that the value is 4, but

450
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,230
you can also use this kind of brute-force
method, and that works as well.

451
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,240
So you can see, there's really a lot of
practical applications in

452
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,250
medicine of understanding a little bit of
basic probability.

453
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,860
I just want to briefly show you for the
concept of expected value,

454
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,260
how it extends to the continuous case.

455
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,640
So here is expected value for the discrete
case.

456
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,260
We're adding up all the values of X times
the probabilities.

457
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,317
Now, as I mentioned this generalizes to
the continuous case, because the summation

458
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:09,181
becomes an integral we're adding up over
incident with a number of possible values.

459
00:26:09,181 --> 00:26:10,380
So it just becomes an integral.

460
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,530
I'm not going to worry about, in this
class, having you do these integrals or

461
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,990
anything, but I'll just show you a very
simple example.

462
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,658
What's the expected value of the uniform
distribution?

463
00:26:18,658 --> 00:26:21,510
Well again, if you just think about the
expected value of the mean,

464
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,070
as a balancing point.

465
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,480
Another way to ask that is, where is the
balancing point of that distribution?

466
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,586
Where could you put the fulcrum to balance
that?

467
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:32,366
And I think everybody would agree that you
would just put the fulcrum at 0.5, so you

468
00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:36,430
don't need to do any calculus to get this
one right, that's the balancing point.

469
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,390
Now, if you wanted to do the calculus,
it's actually not terribly hard for

470
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,540
the uniform distribution, so I'll just
show it here.

471
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,700
Remember, the uniform distribution, the
probability everywhere is just 1, so

472
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,010
we would be just taking x times 1 and
integrating from 0 to 1,

473
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,740
that's the, the total range of possible
values here.

474
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,090
When you do out that integral, it does
come out to be 1 half.

475
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:00,630
So exactly what you would have predicted
just based on intuition.
