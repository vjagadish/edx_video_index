1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,460
So if the size of the effect is greater
that's going to increase your

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,110
chances of getting a significant P-value,

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,029
that's therefore going to increase your
statistical power.

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,760
If the variability of the thing you're
looking at

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,260
is higher there's more variability.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,140
More variability is going to make it
harder to find an effect,

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,060
harder to get a significant P-value.

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,360
So that's going to decrease your
statistical power.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,465
Bigger sample sizes, of course, are going
to increase your statistical power.

10
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:28,310
Finally, of course, we can play with the
significance level.

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,490
A typical study might set the significance
level at 0.05 but

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,920
that's not the only way you can do it.

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,704
Sometimes a significance level might be
set at something lower, like 0.01.

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:42,770
Well, 0.01 is going to mean your type one
error rate is lower than 0.05,and there's

15
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,790
a direct trade-off between type one and
type two error.

16
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,262
If you require a more stringent p value
cutoff, like .01

17
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:56,940
rather than .05, if you want a more, a
stronger significance of a smaller

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,770
significance level, than that's going to
actually decrease your statistical power.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,180
It's harder to find a p value of .01 than
it is to find a p value of .05.

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,910
So that's going to decrease your
statistical power.

21
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,550
Notice that all of those four elements we
could put them together,

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,210
we could put those together and make a
formula that tells us how much, how

23
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,270
big we need to design our studies in order
to have sufficient statistical power.

24
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,940
If you look at all the things that affect
power, the one that's really most under

25
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,730
control, the control of the investigator-
Is the sample size.

26
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,030
The investigator can't really change the
size of the effect, or

27
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,160
the standard deviation, the variability.

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,030
The investigator can, change the
significance level but

29
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,020
there may be particular reasons that we
have to set it to .01 or .05.

30
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,720
So, what's really under the control of the
investigator, in

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,990
terms of influencing the statistical power
of a given study, is the sample size.

32
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,820
So when we plan studies, we actually sit
down,

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,730
before the study starts, and determine how
big of

34
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,081
a smaple size do I need in order to have a
sufficiently powered study.

35
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:03,314
Those sample size formulas are directly
related to

36
00:02:03,314 --> 00:02:05,418
putting those elements together.

37
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:09,190
So, power and sample size are directly
related to one another.

38
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,240
And those are affected by the effect size,

39
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,460
the standard deviation, and the
significance level.

40
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,799
We can put all those five elements
together into formulas that tell us

41
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:19,600
how big of an n, how big of a sample, do I
need for

42
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,440
a given level of power for my study.

43
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,150
I'm just going to put one formula up, one
sample size formula up.

44
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,810
On the screen here so we can talk about
it.

45
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,130
I'm not expecting you to, to want to
memorize or

46
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,670
even use this formula at this point.

47
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,270
If you want to know more about sample size
formulas,

48
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,420
like the sample size calculation, there's
an entire optional module you

49
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,930
can take to learn about all the details of
this formula.

50
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,280
But what I really want Everybody to get
out of here,

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,320
is just the relationships between those
five elements that I just talked about.

52
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,700
Those five elements relate, and

53
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,770
you can put them together to come up with
a sample size format.

54
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,120
So for example, this formula says that the
sample size that you need in

55
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,190
each group is directly related to
variability.

56
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,310
The power you want, the significance level
you want, and the effect size you want.

57
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,160
The variability is in the numerator.

58
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,140
So if the outcome is more highly variable,
then for

59
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,730
a given power, you're going to need a
greater sample size to achieve that power.

60
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,330
The n is going to be bigger because,
variability is in the numerator.

61
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,670
Z beta is how we abbreviate power.

62
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,710
If you want a bigger power,

63
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,170
if you want a power more than 80%, you're
going to need a bigger n.

64
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,310
So, again, power is in the numerator.

65
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,360
You're going to need a bigger n if you
want more power.

66
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,070
If you change your significance level to
be more stringent.

67
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,080
Say, again 0.05 down to 0.01.

68
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,380
If you want a higher level of statistical
significance, then that's in

69
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,080
the numerator too, so you're again,
going to need a bigger sample size.

70
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,740
However, if the effect size is bigger, if
it, if the effect size in the real world,

71
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,710
the true effect is bigger, that's in the
denominator.

72
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,530
So to find a bigger effect size, you
actually need a smaller sample size.

73
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,570
If the effect size is big, it's going to
take less people in your study to find it.

74
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,310
So we can plug in some numbers, some
assumptions into a formula like this.

75
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,090
And come out with the approximate sample
size that we need in our study to

76
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,150
have sufficient power.

77
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,480
Again if you want more details about the
exact derivation of

78
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,220
this sample size formula and formulas like
it you

79
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,220
can refer to the optional module on sample
size calculation.
