00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,380
>> Hi, welcome to unit three.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,120
Today we're going to introduce you to SAS
procedures.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,430
There's two main types of code in SAS.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,190
We already showed you how to use data
steps,

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,370
which manage data one row at a time.

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,530
>> Now we'll show you to use proc steps,
also knows as procedures.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,570
These make changes to the data set one
column at a time.

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,110
Procedures carry out all the forms of
statistical analysis that we'll be

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,320
covering in HRP 223.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,100
Let's start by taking a look at a simple
procedure called Proc means.

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,060
>> Proc steps always begin with the word
Proc, which is short for procedures.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,790
And then, it's followed by the name of the
specific procedure you're using.

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,540
In this case, we're using the means
procedure.

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,530
This is followed by specification of what
data set you want to work on.

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,210
Proc means, will take the numerical mean
of a column you specify in a data set

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:48,720
of your choice.

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,190
Here, we'll work with the same [UNKNOWN]
data set we created last time.

18
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,650
>> Var is used to specify which column, or
variable you want to work on.

19
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,810
Here, we specifically say, we want to
focus on the variable weight.

20
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,180
And calculate the column mean.

21
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,720
If you don't specify which variable to use
in the SAS code,

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,980
you will automatically get results for

23
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,620
all the variable that are relevant to the
type of analysis you are performing.

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,210
Just like in data steps, proc steps must
always end with a run statement.

25
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,840
Let's run this code and take a look at the
output.

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,910
>> As you can see, proc means, gives a few
bits of information by default.

27
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,180
You can see the sample size, N,

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,710
the mean, standard deviation, minimum and
maximum values.

29
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,700
In general, procedures and SAS have some
default output.

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,820
But you can specify exactly what
information you want to see.

31
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,309
And you can specify additional options for
doing more things with the data.

32
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,430
We're going to show that to you in the
next few modules while going through some

33
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,690
important procedures that you'll need to
use in your data analysis.

34
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,290
>> Before moving on, just a quick note on
syntax.

35
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,900
There are a lot of different commands, and
a ton of proxy to use in SAS.

36
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,250
You will soon learn that each command will
have its own syntax.

37
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,980
It can be a bit hard to remember the
syntax for

38
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,520
each proxy you use, especially the ones
you don't use that often.

39
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,610
Lucky for us, SAS is a really thorough
online documentation.

40
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,680
>> When you are not sure about the syntax,
or you do not know what statement to use,

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,090
just search SAS and the name of the proc
you are using.

42
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,550
Go to the link on support.sas.com.

43
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,580
On the left, you can see a list of all the
statements that are valid for

44
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,530
your proc of interest and on the right,

45
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,110
you'll see an explanation of the syntax
for each statement.

46
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,180
You'll find this documentation to be
really useful,

47
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,450
as you start to use more procedures in
your data analysis.
