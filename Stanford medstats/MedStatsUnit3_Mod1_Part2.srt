1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,010
Some other empirical probabilities which
are interesting to look at,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,350
we have really good data in the US on
cancer.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,000
And so, we can say things like,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,780
what's the probability that a US male will
develop cancer in his lifetime.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,040
It turns out to be 44.8%, so that's pretty
high, right?

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,600
The probability then a man dies from
cancer is 23.1%.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,100
We can also look at the statistics for
individual cancers.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,220
The probability that a man develops
prostate,

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,540
prostate cancer in his lifetime is at
16.2%.

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,930
So, about a third of all those cancers
that men

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,330
are developing are prostate cancers.

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,065
And by the way, the,

13
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:41,500
the, the overall probability of cancer
does not include non-melanoma skin cancer.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,186
So, this is excluding non-melanoma skin
cancer.

15
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:48,560
Notice though, that the probability of
developing prostate cancer, 16%.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,450
But the probability of dying from prostate
cancer is much, much lower.

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,110
That tells you a lot of those prostate
cancers are not killing the men.

18
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,320
Compare that to lung cancer.

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,210
So, the probability for

20
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,472
a man of developing lung cancer in the US
in his lifetime is 7.8%.

21
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:06,270
The probability from dying from lung
cancer however is 6.7%.

22
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,000
Those are very close.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,220
So, most people who get lung cancer are
dying from it.

24
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,810
We can see the same statistics for women.

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,180
Interestingly, women have slightly lower
chances of getting cancer or

26
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:16,988
dying from cancer.

27
00:01:16,988 --> 00:01:19,030
38% and 19%.

28
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,560
That's largely because of smoking and
drinking.

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,960
More men smoke and drink, and those are
linked to cancer.

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,180
Breast cancer is the most common cancer
for women.

31
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,180
Her lifetime risk of getting breast cancer
is 12 point 12%.

32
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,860
But her lifetime risk of dying from breast
cancer is much lower.

33
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,030
Only 2.8%, sort of similar to the prostate
cancer for men.

34
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,500
In contrast, a woman's lifetime risk of
developing lung cancer is 6.4%,

35
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,840
slightly lower than for the men.

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,285
But that's, that gap is narrowing as more
women are smoking relative to man.

37
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:51,560
And her probability of dying from lung
cancer is 5%.

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,820
So again, it's a very,

39
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,618
lung cancer is a very deadly cancer,
compared with breast cancer.

40
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:00,962
So now, let's do some actual calculations
of some theoretical probabilities.

41
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:04,560
I'm going to show you a few examples of
how to use what

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,970
are called the counting methods for
calculating probability.

43
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,940
These apply when you have situations where
all the outcomes are equally likely.

44
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,100
And we're literally going to be counting
up all possible outcomes.

45
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,637
And we're going to be

46
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,730
counting the ones that fulfill the event
that we're interested in.

47
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,570
And so, literally that's why it's called
the counting method.

48
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,989
Things that have equally likely outcomes
are things like cards.

49
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:28,320
When you draw a card out of deck of card,

50
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,790
all the cards have an equal likelihood of
being picked.

51
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,970
Or, if you're rolling the dice,

52
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,830
all the sides of the dice have an equal
likelihood of coming up.

53
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,500
So, these counting methods are for this
type of situation.

54
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,690
So, let's just practice these.

55
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,020
Again, these, I think these are fun to
calculate.

56
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,100
So, they're great for gambling too.

57
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,841
So, a lot of, you know, if you really want
to know how to calculate poker

58
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:50,182
probabilities, you need to know the
counting methods.

59
00:02:50,182 --> 00:02:54,052
If, again, if the outcomes are equally
likely to occur, we,

60
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:56,549
we say is that the probability of A
occurring?

61
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:59,050
You're, you're going to put in the
denominator,

62
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,670
you're going to count out the total number
of possible outcomes.

63
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,920
And then, you're going to put in the
numerator out of all those total number of

64
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,480
outcomes, which of those outcomes includes
A occurring?

65
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,110
So, we're literally going to count those
out,

66
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,640
both in the numerator and the denominator.

67
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,740
And these counting methods are pretty
challenging.

68
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,390
They're also sometimes called permutations
and combinations.

69
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,960
Some of you may have done these before.

70
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,970
Most people find them to be pretty
challenging.

71
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,730
I'm just going to, in this module, give
you a few basic examples.

72
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,380
If you want to delve into more details,

73
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,381
there's an optional module which will go
further into the counting methods.

74
00:03:30,381 --> 00:03:33,312
So, here's the first example.

75
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:36,190
We're going to calculate the following
probabilities.

76
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,390
And note that all of these are what we
call with replacement examples.

77
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,430
So, when you roll a die, if you roll a die
once and

78
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,210
you get a six, and then you roll the die
again, you can still get a six again.

79
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,150
If you roll the die again, you can get a
six again.

80
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,070
So, all your outcomes are allowed to
repeat.

81
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,270
This is in contrast to something like, if
you've got a deck of cards.

82
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,180
If you draw the red you know, the ace of
diamonds out of the deck,

83
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,630
if somebody's already drawn that card, it
doesn't repeat.

84
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,850
There isn't another ace of diamonds in the
deck.

85
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,160
So, that would be without replacement.

86
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,490
But things like dice and coins have
replacement.

87
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,470
You can keep rolling heads.

88
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,410
You can keep rolling sixes.

89
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,930
So, what's the probability of getting one
six when you roll a die?

90
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,100
So, that one's not too hard.

91
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,940
So, again, we're going to use the counting
methods here.

92
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,320
So, think about what's my numerator and
what's my denominator.

93
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,870
So, how many possible outcomes are there
when you roll a die?

94
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,100
So there's six possible outcomes.

95
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,880
One, two, three, four, five, or six,
that's our denominator.

96
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,270
How many outcomes are there that involve
getting a six?

97
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,120
Well, there's only one way you can get a
six, right?

98
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,360
So, there's one six out of six, so the
probability here is one out of six.

99
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,600
So, that one's pretty straight forward.

100
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,690
The second question is what's the
probability of getting two sixes when you

101
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,530
roll 2 dice or you roll, you know,

102
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,390
the same dice twice what's the probability
that you're going to get 2 sixes?

103
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,220
So, this one is slightly more challenging.

104
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,360
I want to start with the, again, the
counting method way of solving this.

105
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,959
There's actually more than one way to
solve this, I'll show you both.

106
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,400
That's one of the, the hard things about
probability is.

107
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,190
There is many ways you can get the right
answer.

108
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,050
So, it's often tricky to know which one is
the, is the most efficient.

109
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,480
So, let's start with the counting method,
though.

110
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,410
So, what's the probability of getting two
sixes when rolling two dice?

111
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,680
So, our denominator here is going to be
all possible outcomes that can occur,

112
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,050
when I roll two dice.

113
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,990
So, what can happen when I roll two dice?

114
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,740
Well, let's draw out a little tree to help
us with this.

115
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,580
So, when I roll a die once, there are six
possible outcomes,

116
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,870
each with equal likelihood of occurring.

117
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,150
Those outcomes are you going to get a 1, a
2, a 3, a 4, a 5, or a 6.

118
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,010
So that any of those can occur on the
first roll.

119
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,810
Whatever happens on the first roll,

120
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,360
I'm allowed on the second roll to have all
of these repeat.

121
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,400
I can get a 1, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5, a 6.

122
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,420
So, let's say I get a 1 in the first roll.

123
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,392
Then, I could get a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 on
the second roll.

124
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:58,066
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

125
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:02,160
If I toll a 5 on the first roll, roll of
the die,

126
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,760
I could again get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 on
the second roll.

127
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,200
You can draw out these little trees just
to kind of help you enumerate all

128
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,092
the possibilities.

129
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:14,020
I'm not going to draw out the full tree
here, but you start to get the idea there.

130
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,588
Six possibilities on the first roll.

131
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:19,580
There are six possibilities on the second
roll, because everything repeats.

132
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,922
So, if you drew or

133
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,540
drew out all these branches, you have to
make all the possible branches here.

134
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,720
You would could that there are 36
branches.

135
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,630
Well, how do we get that?

136
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,560
There are 6 possibilities on the first
roll,

137
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,450
times another 6 possibilities on the
second roll.

138
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,810
So, my denominator will be 36 here.

139
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,360
There are 36 possible outcomes when I roll
two dice.

140
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,726
And I'll just point out here that notice
when I'm counting, here's 1, 1, here's 1,

141
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:44,673
2, somewhere down another branch, we'll
have the outcome 2, 1.

142
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:49,786
So, I'm counting getting a 1 first and a 2
second as different than

143
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:55,590
getting a 2 first and then a one second.

144
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,130
That means that we're, what, we call in
probability considering order.

145
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,600
And all you have to know is that if you
consider order in the denominator,

146
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,530
you're going to consider it in the
numerator.

147
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,770
So, you have to be consistent.

148
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,920
So, there's 36 possible outcomes here.

149
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,750
How many of those outcomes involve getting
2 sixes?

150
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,120
Well, there's only one way you can get 2
sixes.

151
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,340
You have to get a six and you have to get
a six again.

152
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,030
There's only 1 branch if you did the
entire tree.

153
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,713
So that probabilities going to be 1 out of
36.

154
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:28,790
Finally, what's the probability of getting
a sum of 6 when rolling two dice?

155
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,880
So, what is, what I mean by sum of 6, so
that is you roll 2 dice.

156
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,090
And what's the probability that if you add
up the values from both of

157
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,610
those rules that that value will equal 6.

158
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,170
So, notice that our denominator is going
to be the same here.

159
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,860
There are 36 possible things that can
happen when you roll two dice.

160
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,230
So, the denominator is the same.

161
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,020
But to get the numerator here, there's no
way

162
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,401
to get the numerator other than just to
count out all the ways that you can get 6.

163
00:07:54,401 --> 00:07:56,210
You can get a 6 by rolling a 1 and then a
5.

164
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,880
You can get a 6 by rolling a 5 and then a
1.

165
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,490
You can get a 6 by rolling a 3 and a 3.

166
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:08,870
You can get 6 by rolling a 2 and a 4, or
by rolling a 4 and 2.

167
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,680
So again, that the numbers on both of dice
have to add up to 6.

168
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,906
Those are all the possible you should get
a sum of 6.

169
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:16,071
I've enumerated them.

170
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:17,238
I've written them out.

171
00:08:17,238 --> 00:08:18,700
There is five of them.

172
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,210
So, the probability of getting a sum of 6
is 5 out of 36.

173
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:27,770
And notice, to solve the, the numerator in
this particular problem,

174
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,050
there wasn't any formula I could rely on.

175
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,950
There's no formula I can give you.

176
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,180
You just literally have to think it out.

177
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,410
And again, that's what's really
challenging about probability problems,

178
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,760
is that I can't give you a pat formula
that works for everything.

179
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,280
In all of the problems, you really have to
think about the problem, what's going on.

180
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,100
And that's the great part about it,
because it really makes your brain work.

181
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,540
But students find that challenging,

182
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,190
because they want me to just give them
some kind of formula they can plug into.

183
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,340
Well, that's not going to be the case
here.

184
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,850
You're actually going to have to really
think.

185
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,070
So, that's the first type of example.

186
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,829
This is with a replacement, the dice can
repeat.
