1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,078
The correct model here is B,

2
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:12,570
the exposure seconds is equal to 49 minus
0.6 times the years since 1930.

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,514
The reason I'm doing it as years since
1930 is because on my graphic I'm

4
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:23,567
not given, my y-axis here doesn't go at X
equals zero, it goes at x equals 1937.

5
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:24,859
So it's just easier for

6
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:30,949
me to estimate the equation of that line,
using years since 1937 as my x variable.

7
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:32,530
You can see I'm very close to 50 here so

8
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,810
I'm guessing that that intercept is at
about 49, so that's my intercept.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,960
How do I get the slope here?

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,758
Well slope is rise over one, run, so

11
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:44,320
we're going to just calculate the change
in y over the change in x.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,082
So the change in y in this graph we're
going from about just kind of

13
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:51,970
estimating 49 maybe down to about 10 here.

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,644
So I'm going to say that's roughly about
39 we're going down so it's negative.

15
00:00:55,644 --> 00:00:59,739
X changes from 1937 to 2000 so that's a 63
unit change in X so that's going to give

16
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:05,500
us a slope of about negative 0.6 so that's
where I got the slope here.

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,370
Just kind of eyeballing this graphic here.

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,640
Which Pearson's coefficient looks the most
reasonable?

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,900
So actually, it's D, negative 0.3.

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,705
You can see that's there an awful lot of
scatter around this line.

21
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,300
This is really not a high correlation at
all.

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,092
So the correct answer is negative 0.3,

23
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:29,603
it's negative certainly, because there our
line is going down.

24
00:01:29,603 --> 00:01:32,600
But a negative 0.5 is actually too big
here.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,500
So negative 0.3 is the correct answer.

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,910
There is a little bit of correlation.

27
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,807
So it's not 0.01 here.

28
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,350
But it's, it's very weak.

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,911
So it's point, negative 0.3.

30
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,250
The correct answer to this is, is B.

31
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,470
Actually, linear regression is probably
not totally appropriate here.

32
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,102
We have a fairly small sample size, and

33
00:01:52,102 --> 00:01:56,660
we're violating probably two of the
assumptions of linear regression.

34
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,676
So you can see that we have a lot of
zeroes in terms of the alcohol

35
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:02,380
exposure time in the movies.

36
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,300
If you have a lot of zeros like that, if
we were to put this in

37
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,220
a histogram you're going to get this kind
of huge zeros and

38
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,870
then it's probably going to be a right
skewed distribution.

39
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,440
It's definitely not going to be normal and
we've got a fairly small sample size here.

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,430
Also we're violating homogeneity of
variances.

41
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,365
You see that there was actually a lot of
variance in,

42
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:20,480
in the movies alcohol exposure early, in
early years and

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,962
then it was kind of lessened between and
then there seems to be more at the end.

44
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:27,910
That may just reflect, you know, how many
movies are captured at each time point,

45
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,050
but it does look like there's some
difference in in the variances there.

46
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:39,260
The correct linear regression equation
here is C.

47
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,560
It's going to be a dummy coded re,
regression equation because we

48
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,029
have a categorical predictor so our
alchemist logs here are P.

49
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:49,945
We're going to have some intercept which
will represent the mean in

50
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:51,940
the reference group.

51
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,226
And then we're going to have a beta for
the infrequent drinkers, and a beta for

52
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:58,095
the occasional or regular drinkers.

53
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,125
And what is it mean to dummy code?

54
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,547
So again, when we dummy code what we're
doing is we're saying we've got

55
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:09,380
a categorical predictor where you want to
represent that with two binary variables.

56
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,460
So here's my drinking category that I've
got my occasional regular drinkers.

57
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,100
I've got my infrequent drinkers.

58
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,720
And then I'm making the never drinkers the
reference group.

59
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,880
That's somewhat arbitrary.

60
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,530
But that was the only correct answer I
gave you.

61
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,190
So you had to use that one as the
reference group.

62
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,120
Then I'm making two new variables.

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,170
A binary variable.

64
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,710
Which is you're an infrequent drinker or
you're not.

65
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,038
And a binary variable which says you're an
occasional or regular drinker, or

66
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:36,370
you're not.

67
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,472
So that means the occasional or regular
drinkers will be a one on that variable,

68
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:41,750
and the other two will be zeroes.

69
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,656
The, infrequent drinkers will get a one on
the infrequent variable, and

70
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:48,360
the other two will get zeros.

71
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,605
And the never group by default, they're
the ones that get a zero for

72
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:57,050
the infrequent variable and a zero for
that occasional, regular category.

73
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:04,880
So they actually, their mean will be
captured in the intercept.

74
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,150
The correct answer here is negative 1.35.

75
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,190
Where did I get that from?

76
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,750
So I'm going to go to the graphic for the
occasional regular drinkers.

77
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,938
And I'm looking for the slope for

78
00:04:13,938 --> 00:04:16,580
the people without depression, that's the
solid line.

79
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,197
Well that lines goes from about a positive
0.1 down to a negative,

80
00:04:21,197 --> 00:04:24,330
about negative 1.25.

81
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,082
So what's the slope?

82
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:30,329
Well, the change in y here, it goes down
1.35.

83
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:34,361
X goes from never a drinker to occasional
drinker, remember this is quoted as

84
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:38,780
a 01 variable so the change in x is just
going to be one.

85
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,749
So, our slope is negative 1.35.

86
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:44,277
It's just the difference in the means
between the reference group,

87
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:49,160
the never drinker group and the occasional
regular drinker group.

88
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,393
For this question, notice, I didn't ask, I
didn't specify which graph for

89
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:53,957
you to look at.

90
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:57,349
That's because the intercept represents
the mean for the never drinkers and

91
00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:00,640
you can see the never drinkers on both
graphics.

92
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,570
The never drinkers have a mean of 0.1.

93
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,440
So the intercept here is going to be
positive 0.1 or the, depth A here.

94
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,600
So one of the main conclusions from this
picture that we an draw is B.

95
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,904
The alcohol drinking seems to be
associated with a smaller decrease in

96
00:05:16,904 --> 00:05:21,453
inflammation in the depressed group, than
in the nondepressed group.

97
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:25,300
The nondepressed people seem to get a
better benefit from alcohol.

98
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,106
There's actually an interaction going on
here and

99
00:05:27,106 --> 00:05:29,100
that's what this graphic illustrates.

100
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,446
So, the correct model here is D.

101
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:37,982
This is a, Model, linear regression model
that has just a categorical predictor in

102
00:05:37,982 --> 00:05:39,935
the model that's been dummy coded, so

103
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:46,401
if you find the 4.4 in our little table
here, the outcome is visual reception.

104
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,695
We're talking about the unadjusted beta,
so

105
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:53,090
the only thing that's in the model is the
categorical variable.

106
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,590
It's a three-level categorical variable.

107
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,592
You are either exclusively formula fed,
partially breast fed, or exclusively, or

108
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,040
almost exclusively breast fed.

109
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,740
So there's three categories.

110
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,120
So, our visual reception scores are
outcome.

111
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,011
That's going to be equal to some intercept
plus the beta for

112
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:14,210
the exclusive breast feeders plus the beta
for the partial breast feeders.

113
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,632
And, I'm assuming, that the, and it tells
us in the table that the reference group

114
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:25,220
is the formula fed group so, that's why,
they, those are captured in the intercept.

115
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,359
The correct answer here is B.

116
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:32,861
the, again, we're talking about this value
of 4.4.

117
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:37,700
It's saying that, on average, it's a, a
yes/no variable here.

118
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,284
You're either exclusively breast fed, and

119
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:42,760
that's being compared to the reference
group of exclusively formula fed.

120
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,472
So, on average, the exclusively breast fed
babies score 4.4 points higher in

121
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,520
visual reception, compared with the
formula fed babies.

122
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,090
That's what the the value of that beta
coefficient means, the beta coefficient,

123
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,691
the 95 percent confidence interval here
goes from 0.7 to 8.2,

124
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:59,649
it does not cross the null value of zero,
therefore we know that this is

125
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:05,400
a statistically significant result, so
again the correct answer is B.

126
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,420
So the correct answer here is A.

127
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,836
Much of the apparent relationship between
exclusive breastfeeding and

128
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:17,720
infant cognitive function was actually due
to confounding by other variables.

129
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,887
And you can see that here in all of these
different, models and

130
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:26,050
all these different outcomes.

131
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,314
You can see, for example, for the visual
reception score goes from 4.4 down to

132
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:32,700
2.4 when adjusted for these potential
confounders.

133
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,900
So there's a big drop in the data and
that's true across all of

134
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,380
the different datas That are measuring
cognitive function here.

135
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,270
Not just the visual reception score.

136
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,010
The correct answer here is A.

137
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,780
Breast milk DHA was treated as a
continuous variable.

138
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,040
So these beta coefficients represent the
change in cognitive score for

139
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,820
every 1% increase in DHA.

140
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,832
There's actually a clue here in the table,
because if you read carefully you can see

141
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:03,372
it says continuous, and if you read the
fine print it tells you that it's,

142
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:09,200
the units here are per a 1% increase in
fatty acid concentration.
