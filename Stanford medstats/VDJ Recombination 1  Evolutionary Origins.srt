2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:14,100
This is a review of VDJ recombination
starting from the beginning.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,230
And I mean really starting from the
beginning and

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,710
then going through the whole process.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,868
So here we are, at the beginning of time.

6
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:22,620
Actually, not really.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,400
Around the time when jawless fish were
swimming in the ocean and around that

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,770
time, there was, there was transposable
element, mobile element, that hops

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:38,130
around from genome to genome and mobile
elements have are, are like retro viruses.

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:44,930
They have sequences at their ends that
allow them to jump around.

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,439
And so here's a mobile element.

12
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,490
And it's got two two sequences at the end.

13
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,214
They're not quite the same but they are
very similar and one is in red and

14
00:00:57,214 --> 00:00:58,260
one is in blue.

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,100
And what they do is they surround two
genes.

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,520
And those two genes, are now known as RAG
1 and

17
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,230
RAG 2, and I'll abbreviate it this way.

18
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,390
And RAG 1 RAG, and

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:22,230
RAG 2 [COUGH] now called the recombination
activating genes were really ,.

20
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,630
And integrates for the mobile element that
allowed the mobile element to

21
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,420
integrate and hop out of genomes.

22
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,180
So I'm going to draw you the genome of
this ancient jawed fish.

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,240
And here is the genome, or a little
segment of the genome.

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,510
The place where the mobile element is
destined to hop in.

25
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,360
And.

26
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:50,850
Here is an ancient gene that's going to
turn out to be the immunoglobulin gene.

27
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:57,500
So this is the ancient immunoglobulin
gene, and this mobile element is going

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:04,120
to hop into this gene, just so, and as a
result of hopping in at that location.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,000
The mobile element will split the
immunoglobulin gene into two pieces.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,730
So now I'm going to show you the mobile
element as it appears.

31
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,800
Here's the mobile element.

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,546
And here's the other side of it.

33
00:02:16,546 --> 00:02:20,810
And it's hopped in into that location
there.

34
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,650
And.

35
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,580
Okay.
And so the ancient immunoglobulin gene has

36
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:32,180
now been split into two pieces.

37
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,940
And here are the two pieces.

38
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,830
All right?

39
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,160
And it could hop in the second time.

40
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,640
And, we'll draw in the mobile element
hopping in the second time.

41
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,650
Imagine in the same mobile element, is now
reversed so they're red and

42
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,500
blue, it's turned upside down, well I'll
just turn it upside down for you.

43
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,429
Here it is and, turned backwards.

44
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:08,030
because it's going to happen to hop in to
this ancient amino globin gene.

45
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,080
Just happens to be right next door.

46
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,685
And this'll be the second hopping event.

47
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:17,280
[COUGH] And what you end up with, is two
mo,

48
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,450
mobile elements in the genome very close
together.

49
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,100
So here's one mobile element.

50
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:31,460
[BLANK_AUDIO]

51
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,210
And here is the other mobile element.

52
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,770
[BLANK_AUDIO]
And it's really the same

53
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,820
mobile element that's hopped into two
locations.

54
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,630
And it's in the genome.

55
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,860
All right?

56
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,080
And it's ended up splitting the
immunoglobulin gene now into three pieces.

57
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:06,210
[BLANK_AUDIO]

58
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:12,018
And [COUGH] these three pieces are now
known as the Ancient V-Region,

59
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:19,465
an, Ancient D-Region, and Ancient J-Region
of the anemia hemoglobin heavy chain.

60
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:26,770
[COUGH]
And now imagine that this mobile element.

61
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,550
So, so we've got three steps now.

62
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,590
The, starting with ancient immunoglobulin
gene,

63
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,010
the ancien gene split into two different
pieces.

64
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:41,250
So here's, so we, we split the ancient
immunoglobulin gene into two pieces and

65
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,990
then with a second insertion of a mobile
element, split it into three pieces.

66
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,580
And now we have the gene split into three
pieces.

67
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,070
And then the next step is,

68
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,790
each of these little pieces could undergo
a gene duplication.

69
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:02,470
So for example, the V region here, could
end up getting copied multiple times,

70
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,410
so that you would have multiple V regions,
and you'd have multiple D and multiple J.

71
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,840
So I'll just draw.

72
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,700
What multiple V regions would look like.

73
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,540
You would have the following.

74
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,080
And then there would be a little V piece
here.

75
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,910
And then, since it's duplicated.

76
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,710
Actually let me make this a neat diagram.

77
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:34,630
So here's another element,

78
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,740
another V segment and here's another V
segment and

79
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:49,229
let me fill in the details so, there's a V
region.

80
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,310
There's another V region there.

81
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,450
There's another V region there.

82
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,410
So, so what we have is.

83
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,460
We have this V region being duplicated
into three regions.

84
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,179
So let's call them V1, V2 and V3.

85
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:16,680
And, they arose from the original
primordial region, via a process called

86
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,910
gene duplication and the same thing, this
could happen 500 for V regions and

87
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,600
a dozen times, er, four times, and a dozen
times for the J region and so on.

88
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,556
So you end up with, the.

89
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:34,746
Current than modern.

90
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:39,530
Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene.

91
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,020
So that's what this is.

92
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,270
With after the gene duplications.

93
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,739
So that's where it all got started.
