00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,840
Hi, I'm Doctor Larry Chu.

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,500
>> And I'm Dr. Kevin Jenner.

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,340
>> And welcome back to this course from
the Stanford AIM Lab

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,690
on Geriatric Anesthesia.

7
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:41,000
Now in this segment, we're going to talk
about delirium and cognitive dysfunction.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,790
The specific learning objectives for this
segment include four things.

9
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,480
We're going to talk first about how to
recognize common causes of delirium in

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,150
elderly patients.

11
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:57,400
two, we're going to talk about some
effective prevention strategies.

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,060
We're also going to talk about appropriate
treatment options available for

13
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,360
elderly patients.

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,030
And finally, we're going to wrap things up
by talking about the purpose and

15
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,600
safe use of chemical and physical
restraints in the elderly.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,830
So let's get started.

17
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,450
>> Okay.

18
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,730
>> So Kevin, talk to me a little bit about
some of the common causes of delirium and

19
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,840
cognitive dysfunction in elderly patient.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,140
Well, there's several causes and it's best
to divide these up into immediate causes

21
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,040
and things that may occur later in a
patient's post-operative course.

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,280
Immediate causes may be things like a
response to discontinuation of

23
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,430
a psychiatric medication in the
perioperative period.

24
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,070
Hypoperfusion of the brain during a
surgical procedure or the post-operative

25
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,810
period, which may lead to a stroke or
other problems with cognitive decline.

26
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,380
In addition, if a patient has a
preexisting disability,

27
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,460
such as hearing loss or blindness.

28
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,210
That may manifest itself or

29
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,920
appear to clinicians as post-operative
cognitive decline,

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,030
if that's unrecognized and they don't
realize what's going on with that patient.

31
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,590
In addition, genetics sometimes plays a
role.

32
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,210
Some people are just more prone to
post-operate de,

33
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,050
delirium and cognitive decline than other
patients, and we aren't sure why.

34
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,580
What are some of the late causes, Dr. Chu?

35
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,010
>> Well, so some of the things that we
have to keep in mind is that later

36
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,920
on the patient can, for instance, have
worsening.

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,760
Other chronic conditions.

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,910
That can be a reason for seeing cognitive
dysfunction or delirium.

39
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,200
Of course, it could be an underlying
dementia that get,

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,330
gets unmasked later on, during the course
of the hospital stay.

41
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,130
Even infections, like urinary tract
infections, can cause delirium and

42
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,560
cognitive dysfunction in the elderly.

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,490
And of course, we don't want to forget
about disturbances in

44
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,470
strategic rhythm and, and also of course
sleep deprivation.

45
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,130
Being in a hospital, out of their natural
environment,

46
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,120
they just don't get the regular quality
sleep that they're normally getting.

47
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,590
So these are all important considerations
in thinking about the common causes of

48
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,749
delirium, and post-operative cognitive
dysfunction in elderly patients.

49
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,280
Well, now that we know some of the common
causes,

50
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,990
let's talk a little bit about effective
prevention strategies.

51
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,750
It's better to prevent these things from
happening in the first place.

52
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,730
Tell us a little bit about how you can do
that, Kevin.

53
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,725
>> Well, some of the things you can do is
continue a patient's mental health

54
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:21,170
medications if at all possible in the
perioperative period.

55
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,180
That can avoid things like worsening of a
patients depression which may

56
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,820
lead to cognitive decline and delirium in
the perioperative period.

57
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,410
In addition, if a patient has co-morbid
disease,

58
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,600
it's important to keep those under
control.

59
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,945
Having glucose levels that are very high
or very low maybe lead to

60
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:40,770
post-operative cognitive dysfunction in a
diabetic patient or in other patients.

61
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,280
So it's important to keep those things in
mind and to keep the patient as close to

62
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,360
homeostasis and normal as possible while
treating what they've preve,

63
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,140
presented to the hospital for in the first
place.

64
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,710
>> Now of course, one of the other things
that's really important is to

65
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,510
maintain really good sleep hygiene.

66
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,100
Right?
We want to make sure we're not waking up

67
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,310
our elderly patients in the middle of the
night unnecessarily.

68
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,940
So that it disturbs their circadian
rhythm, so

69
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:12,240
that they have really, disbalance in terms
of their normal sleeping patterns.

70
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,750
And it also bears mentioning that we
shouldn't be adding new medications

71
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,670
at this point that may worsen
post-operative cognitive dysfunction or

72
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,310
delirium by adding medications for sleep
or anxiety.

73
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:32,050
Let's first try to focus on minimizing
those disturbances in the first place so

74
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,579
we don't have to layer on pharmacologic
treatments that may further

75
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,600
complicate the issue.

76
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,540
So Kevin, let's assume we did implement
all of those preventative strategies, yet

77
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,330
we still see delirium or post operative
cognitive dysfunction.

78
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,510
Let's talk a little bit about our
treatment strategy in that scenario.

79
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,290
What are we going to do?

80
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,750
Well, it's important first and foremost to
go and assess the patient.

81
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,540
Keep in mind, delirium and post-operative
cognitive dysfunction lay in a spectrum.

82
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,570
There's some patients who may be extremely
agitated and

83
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,030
combative, and other patients who may just
be somewhat disoriented and

84
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,070
require reorientation in order to bring
them back to where they are.

85
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,390
It's important for a physician to go and
assess the patient before prescribing any

86
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,650
sort of treatment or medication for that
patient.

87
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,080
Also, keep in mind that frequent
reorientation may be needed for

88
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,250
patients and may be preferred to
pharmacologic techniques or

89
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,260
physical restraints depending on the
patient's situation.

90
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,390
Now, in the event of a patient who is
delirious, it's also important to un,

91
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,720
to identify the underlying cause, if you
can do so.

92
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,700
That may involve doing things like
ordering lab tests to see if

93
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,580
there's electrolyte abnormalities.

94
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,810
Or perhaps, studies to see if there's
urine urinary tract infection or

95
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,980
other problems.

96
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,860
Get the entire healthcare team involved.

97
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,400
The nurse, other members, other physicians
and

98
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,460
consultants, and try to figure out what
exactly is causing this.

99
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,500
And treat the underlying cause of their
delirium.

100
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,880
Delirium is usually a result of something
else that's going on.

101
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,690
Now, in the event of needing to use
pharmacological therapies,

102
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,790
things like like sedatives.

103
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,920
Benzodiazepines are, are somewhat risky in
patients who, of the geriatric population.

104
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,350
And it's important to dose those
appropriately for

105
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,040
the physiologic status of the patient that
you're working with.

106
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,900
Other treatments, such as Haldol, again,
need to be dosed appropriately for

107
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,800
a geriatric patient's body.

108
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,080
Every patient is different,

109
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,550
so keep that in mind when you are working
with geriatric patients.

110
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,980
Frequent reassessment will be necessary
too.

111
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,291
Now there is a place for, for physical
restraints as well.

112
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,348
>> There is.
>> What is that?

113
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:43,670
>> I mean, there, it is appropriate to use
physical restraints when the patient

114
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,060
is endangering themselves.

115
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,920
If you're concerned about fall risks.

116
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,960
But we need to also then be judicious.

117
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,590
And we need to reassess on a daily basis
if we're going to be using restraints.

118
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:02,921
Of course you may also have the resources
to arrange a one-on-one sitter,

119
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:05,850
and, and maybe that would be appropriate
for the patient.

120
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,350
And we wouldn't necessarily need to have
restraints.

121
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:13,132
In either case in this situation, I would
really recommend outreach to the patient's

122
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:18,060
family so that they understand what the
purpose of restraints are.

123
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,232
Why are we instituting these practices and

124
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:23,930
more importantly so they can become
engaged in the patient's care.

125
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,620
They can help reorient the patient.

126
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,350
They can be there to support their loved
one as they're recovering from

127
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,682
the surgery.

128
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:34,572
Of course, we also want to involve our
mental and

129
00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:38,029
behavioral specialists early on in the
course of

130
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:42,430
the treating post-operative cognitive
dysfunction or delirium.

131
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:49,026
So we can really get a multi-disciplinary
approach to treating this problem.

132
