00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,480
Welcome to week four of the course.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,480
This week, we're going to continue our
discussion of Cox regression, and

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,270
I'm going to tell you about some really
cool things that you can do with

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:18,280
a Cox regression model, including
incorporating time-changing predictors.

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,530
So this week we're going to talk more
about Cox regression.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,400
I'm going to tell you about some
variations on Cox regression.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,050
So, for one thing, last week we were
talking about using the time scale of

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,040
the time that you're in the study.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,980
But we can actually switch the time scale
and

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,605
make the time scale age rather than time
in the study.

12
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll show you how to do that.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,060
We're also going to talk about
time-dependent predictors.

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,740
This is the first time that we've had a
model that incorporates time and therefore

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,150
that we are actually able to update
people's values for a given predictor.

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,410
That's really cool.

17
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,380
And I'll show you how that works this
week.

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,140
I'll also tell you some strategies for
dealing with repeated events.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,110
So up until now, we've only been doing the
time until the first event occurs.

20
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,380
But what if you have an event, like a
heart attack or an episode of disability

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,380
that can happen, or a fracture, that can
happen multiple times during your study?

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,530
How do you deal with repeated events?

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,440
I'll also talk to you about how to deal
with clustered observations with

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,950
correlations in your data.

25
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,130
Most of what I'm going to be talking about
this week I'm going to have to present you

26
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,880
the likelihood function, go through how
things happen in the likelihood function.

27
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,340
For you to be able to really understand
what's going on,

28
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,740
you have to kind of dig into the
likelihood function.

29
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,190
So by the end of this week, you're going
to be dreaming in likelihood functions.

30
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,010
Just as a quick review, if you totally got
the likelihood function last week you

31
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,980
can fast forward this part, but let me
just give you a brief review of

32
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,670
the likelihood function for a Cox
regression so we're all on the same page.

33
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,450
So what I've done down here is I've drawn
out a very small simple little data set.

34
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,820
It's got four people in it.

35
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,250
Their ID numbers are one, two, three and
four.

36
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,260
And there's one predictor we're going to
look at, they're either in the treatment

37
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,460
group treatment equals one, or they're in
the control group treatment equals zero.

38
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,050
I've represented their data over time
here.

39
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,900
So for example subject one, it was in the
study for 12 months and

40
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,440
then the x means they had the event.

41
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,160
So they had the event.

42
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,100
Subject two was in the study for say,
about eight months.

43
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,520
And then the c represents the sensor.

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,610
How does this translate to a likelihood
function for Cox regression?

45
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,740
So remember that the likelihood function
for

46
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,360
Cox regression contains one term for every
event.

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,035
So, in this case we have two events.

48
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:35,890
Subject one and subjects three both have
the event so

49
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,650
we're going to have two terms in the
likelihood.

50
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,220
The terms and the likelihood again
represent the probability of your data.

51
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,220
For Cox regression, we're using a
conditional likelihood.

52
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,280
So we're looking at the probability of, if
we know.

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,670
We're conditioning on,

54
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,870
if we know that an event happened at five
months into the study.

55
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,240
We're conditioning on that fact.

56
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,540
If we know that an even happened at five
months into the study.

57
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,340
What's the probability that it happened to
subject three as opposed to

58
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,130
anybody else who was at risk?

59
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,240
That's what the term in a likelihood
represents.

60
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,300
So the denominator of the terms is going
to contain the probability of

61
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,036
anybody having the event at time two,
anybody who is at risk.

62
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:21,556
And we're going to be putting into that
denominator the hazard rate for

63
00:03:21,556 --> 00:03:27,470
person, in this case subject one was at
risk at five months into the study.

64
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,810
Subject two was at risk, subject three was
at risk, and subject four was at risk.

65
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,520
So, the denominator contains the
probability of having the event at

66
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,840
exactly five months for any one of those
four people who were at risk.

67
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,300
Each of their hazard rates.

68
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,060
The numerator is going to contain the
hazard, the probability for the person who

69
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,530
actually did have the event, which happens
to be subject three here.

70
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,330
Remember, for Cox regression, the baseline
hazards, we're going to assume that

71
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,970
everybody has the same baseline hazard and
those are going to cancel out, so

72
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,760
we're not going to be estimating any
intercepts here.

73
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,370
And so, what is the hazard function
actually?

74
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,720
What does it boil down to?

75
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,440
It's going to be some e raised to data one
times x one times beta two times x two.

76
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,940
Whatever you have in your Cox regression
model for predictors.

77
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,530
Well, in this case, let's say we just have
one predictor which is treatment.

78
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,050
The person who had the event was person
three subject three.

79
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,670
They were not on treatment.

80
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,990
They have a value of zero for treatment.

81
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,960
We can also replace the hazard functions
in the denominator,

82
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,750
in terms of e raised to betas.

83
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,970
And so the person who had the event, they
had beta raised, times zero.

84
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,120
The person who, everybody else who was at
risk we had,

85
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,100
subject one who is in the treatment group
who is at risk.

86
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,983
That's their chance of having the event
right now as a function of beta.

87
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:50,222
Subject two was also in the treatment
group, and

88
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:53,034
then finally subject four was a control.

89
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:56,376
So that's what the first terminal
likelihood here is going to look like.

90
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:59,951
Again, representing the probability that
it was subject three as opposed to

91
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,359
anybody else who was at risk.

92
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:05,940
Conditioned on the fact we know we had an
event at five months into the study.

93
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,200
The second event happened at 12 months
into the study.

94
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,090
At that time period, there were only two
people at risk, subject one and

95
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:11,620
subject four.

96
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,750
So the only people who could've had the
event there is the subject four,

97
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,380
who was in the control group and subject
one, who was in the treatment group.

98
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,490
The one who actually had the event was
subject one who was

99
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,420
in the treatment group.

100
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,910
So that would be our likelihood function
for this simple data set.

101
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,610
If you understand the likelihood function,

102
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,500
that's going to allow you to do a lot of
cool things.

103
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,960
So one of the things that we're going to
grapple with this week is incorporating

104
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,770
time changing predictors into our model.

105
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,884
So, what do I mean by that?

106
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:43,679
Go back to this example I was talking
about last week

107
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:47,709
about Academy Award winners, and those who
are only ever nominated, and

108
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:51,629
I'm showing you the Kaplan–Meier curve
here for the screenwriters.

109
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:57,081
For the screenwriters, unlike for the
actors and actresses, those

110
00:05:57,081 --> 00:06:03,553
who are ever only nominated actually did
better than those who were the winners.

111
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:07,348
But what's interesting if you think
carefully about this Kaplan–Meier curve,

112
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:10,069
there was a problem with this analysis, as
I mentioned.

113
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,168
Look, you can see that the time scale here
is age, so we're starting at age zero.

114
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:19,620
We are counting people is in the nominee
group on the red line, or

115
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,020
in the winners group on the blue line from
birth.

116
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,340
But that somehow seems wrong because
people were not

117
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,170
didn't win an Academy Award at birth, they
weren't nominated at birth.

118
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,780
Those events of being nominated or winning
an Academy Award happen much later in

119
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,110
life, and yet we're somehow assuming that
their status in one group or

120
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,690
the other translates and so, effects their
longevity their whole life.

121
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,100
So there's something quite wrong with
that.

122
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,330
With time-changing predictors what we're
going to be able to do is to correctly

123
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,240
count somebody as a control or a nominee
or as a winner for

124
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,630
the ages in which they were in one of
those groups.

125
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,780
So you can have the status of being a
nominee only for many,

126
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,520
many years before we switch you into the
winner's group.

127
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,710
That's going to be a much better way to
analyze these data.

128
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,560
I'm also going to tell you this week how
to deal with repeated events.

129
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,560
And so I'm just showing you an example
here of a study that has repeated events.

130
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,450
There are five subjects pictured here.

131
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,060
Every time you see a little black dot,
that's an episode of disability.

132
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,360
So what you'll notice is that some
subjects had many episodes of

133
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,040
disability over time.

134
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,130
Up until now I've only told you how to
deal with time to first event,

135
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,900
that would be the first dot you see on
each of these, but if you just look at

136
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,630
time the first event for data like this,
you'd be missing a lot of information, so

137
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,630
how we grapple with, how do we handle
repeated events?

138
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,020
I'll show you how to do that this week.
