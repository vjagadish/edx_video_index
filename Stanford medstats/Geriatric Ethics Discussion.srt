00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:18,647
[MUSIC]

3
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:22,630
Hi, I'm Dr. Kevin Jenner.

4
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,220
I'm a resident in Anesthesiology at the
Medical College of Wisconsin.

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,160
In this module of the Essentials of
Geriatric Anesthesia course, we're going

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,980
to be talking to Dr. Lauren Milner, she's
joining me from the Center for

7
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,410
Biomedical Ethics, at Stanford University,
where she's a fellow.

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,740
She's also a committee member on

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,299
the Stanford Hospital Medical Ethics
Committee.

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,420
In this section, we have three objectives.

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,440
Those are to first discuss what should be
done with Mr.

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,355
Williams in this particular medical
situation.

13
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:54,400
Mr. Williams has a do not intubate order
that was seen in the computer, but

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,340
the computer system in unavailable.

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,700
So, how should a medical practitioner act
in the face of

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,810
ambiguous information regarding the
patient's wishes?

17
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:07,360
We'll also discuss the terms capacity,
competence, autonomy and surrogate

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,510
decision maker, and discuss how those
relate to making decisions for patients

19
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,600
who may not be able to make decisions on
their own, for their own medical care.

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,730
The third objective, will be to discuss
how medical professionals should act

21
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,310
when surrogate decision makers and
advanced directives conflict.

22
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,150
In those situations, what should the
medical,

23
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,950
what should the medical practitioner do?

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,150
Especially in emergency situations, this
can be perplexing, and

25
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,300
a decision needs to be made quickly.

26
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,090
Thank you for joining me today, Dr.
Milner.

27
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,770
>> Very happy to be here.

28
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,710
>> So in discussing Mr. Williams, and in
this particular situation, where

29
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,699
there's ambiguous information, how would
you suggest the anesthesiologist act?

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,080
So in this particular situation,

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,230
it's pretty clear that the
anesthesiologist should intubate.

32
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,690
And the reason for that,

33
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,550
is because although there was a suggestion
of documented evidence of wishes,

34
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,920
we don't actually have any documented
evidence of wishes.

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,250
And so, to be on the safe side.

36
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,230
And also because the son, who seems to be
an appropriate surrogate, and

37
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,320
is acting in the best wishes of his father

38
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,300
has said that his father would want to be
intubated.

39
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,000
>> Okay.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,940
So, the anesthesiologist would,

41
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,040
would be doing the right thing in this
situation, to intubate him.

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,480
In the absence of a clear directive,
otherwise.

43
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,770
>> Absolutely.

44
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,200
>> Now in, in a situation where there is a
clear directive otherwise and

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,100
say you do have a do not intubate or do
not resuscitate order.

46
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,060
And you have a family member who's saying,
no, I, I want to override that.

47
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,750
What do you do in that type of situation?

48
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,460
>> Well, that's a much trickier situation.

49
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,610
But.

50
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:50,170
And when there's, again, unambiguous
written and

51
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,280
documented evidence of the patient's
wishes, that is what you do.

52
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,010
Even if a family member is protesting.

53
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,970
If the documented wishes are clear, then
that's how you proceed.

54
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,700
>> Okay.
So in an emergency situation,

55
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,430
if you have that documented evidence,

56
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,125
that is most important piece of
information you can have.

57
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,070
>> Mm-hm.

58
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,830
>> So, when it comes to co, some of these
complex issues, some topics and

59
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,365
some ideas are thrown around.

60
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:16,650
>> Mm-hm.
>> Especially the terms

61
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,910
competence and capacity.

62
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,640
You know, the patient has competence or

63
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,080
is competent to do this or they have
capacity to make this decision.

64
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,690
What exactly is meant by the terms
capacity and,

65
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,190
and how's it different from competence?

66
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,160
>> So that is a great question because
capacity and

67
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,670
competence do get conflated a lot.

68
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:42,110
So, competence really refers to a broader

69
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:47,160
situation that goes across time in terms
of their decision making capacity frankly

70
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,230
that's generally decided by the courts and
if a person lacks of competence it

71
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,890
generally means that they can't make any
decisions usually for an extended period.

72
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:01,010
Now in contrast capacity is both time and
situation dependent.

73
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:07,340
And can that determination of capacity can
be made by the clinician,

74
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,180
or Psychiatry or the Ethics Committee.

75
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,700
So, just as an example of this,

76
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,930
a patient may not have capacity to make
medical decisions.

77
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,200
But they might have the capacity to des,
assign a surrogate decision maker.

78
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,910
So it really depends, again, on what
you're asking.

79
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,012
And what time you're asking it at.

80
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:29,360
>> Okay.
>> If that makes sense.

81
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,980
>> It does.

82
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,700
It does.
So it sounds like capacity is,

83
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,300
is much more what we interact with in

84
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,625
a medical world where competence sounds
like it's more of a legal thing.

85
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,210
>> Mm-hm.

86
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,550
>> If a patient has the competence to, to
do something and

87
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,450
that's more of a long standing
determination made by a court.

88
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,930
>> Absolutely.

89
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,680
Again, capacity is really in the moment.

90
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,530
So we think about capacity a lot of times
by asking ourselves does the patient have,

91
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,958
it, do they clearly comprehend and

92
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:06,430
can they articulate the consequences of
different medical options.

93
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,440
And if they can, and they have a
reasonable rationale for why they want

94
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,350
a particular option, and they understand,
like I said, the consequences of all

95
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,520
the options, then they're deemed to have
capacity to make that choice.

96
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,960
>> Okay.

97
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,580
So as far as advanced directives and do
not resuscitate, do not intubate orders,

98
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,105
what, what is different between an
advanced directive.

99
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:29,780
>> Mm-hm.
>> And a do not resuscitate order?

100
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,650
Are they different or are they both the
same, what, what do they mean?

101
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,280
>> Oh sure.

102
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,430
So a do not resuscitate, do not intubate
is an order

103
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,980
that's given by a clinician, and that can
really happen at any time,

104
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,500
you can write it in the chart, it's very
fluid, you can make them.

105
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,188
We call it DNRDNI, or or you can make them

106
00:05:52,188 --> 00:05:57,140
non-DNRDNI so where as an advanced
directive is,

107
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,430
is dictated by the patient and it's much,
much more comprehensive, generally.

108
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,480
A DNRDNI would be included in the advance
directive, but there can also, generally

109
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,590
there's instructions on who should be
making decisions for the pace, patient.

110
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,830
If they lack capacity.

111
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:20,100
There are, instructions on other medical
procedures they,

112
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,750
they would or would not want.

113
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,190
So it's, it's a much, much more detailed
and

114
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,720
thorough documentation of all kinds of
patient's wishes.

115
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,940
And again, that is really dictated by the
patient,

116
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,300
it is much more formal, it generally has
to be signed by a witness, so.

117
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,060
>> Okay, so it is a much more,

118
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,750
the advanced directive is probably what
this patient had in their chart and

119
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,720
in actuality, it's unlikely someone on a
patient we

120
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,230
had just rolled through the door, had
written a DNR or DNI order, so it is very.

121
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,500
It's, it's kind of surprising in this
particular situation.

122
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,230
You would, you would wonder what the
patient ac, actually wanted.

123
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,910
And it would be safe to err on the side
of, of intubating him, like you said,

124
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,670
in the absence of, of additional
information.

125
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,610
So in, in thinking about the patient's
son,

126
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,889
what is his role in this particular
situation.

127
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,440
>> So in this particular situation,

128
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,620
the son would serve as the father's
medical surrogate,

129
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,450
because the father, at this time, would
lack capacity to make decisions.

130
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,660
So that means that he, again, would be
making the decisions for the patient

131
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,190
because presumably he knows the patient
well enough to know his choices.

132
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,435
Certainly better.

133
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:35,150
Than you, you know, the doctor.

134
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,250
>> Doctor or nurse.

135
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,200
>> Who just met him or you know, a perfect
stranger.

136
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,090
>> Yeah exactly.

137
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,900
Okay.
>> So, until he would basically be

138
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,790
making medical decisions for

139
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:49,160
the father until such time that the father
could make medical decisions for himself.

140
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,150
>> Okay, and then when it comes to
surrogates,

141
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,850
I hear that there's a lot of complication,
in terms of

142
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,330
determining who exactly the patient's
surrogate decision maker should be.

143
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,680
In this case, it's pretty clear.

144
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,530
There's only one family member.

145
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,970
And it's a first degree relative.

146
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,335
An ad, an adult son of the patient.

147
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:08,100
>> Mm-hm.
>> Now, when you have a room full of,

148
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,030
you know, 20 family members and some
friends from high school and some other

149
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,305
friends and maybe distant relatives and
adopted children and whatnot.

150
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:15,840
>> Mm-hm.

151
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,200
>> How do you decide who's going to be the
patient's surrogate decision maker if

152
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,765
everyone can't agree on what should be
done for the patient?

153
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:24,280
[NOISE].

154
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,430
>> So again, a fabulous question, and I
can't stress enough how variable this is.

155
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,500
It really depends on what state you're
practicing in.

156
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,520
So here in California.

157
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,370
Surrogate decision makers are generally
signed by the medical team and

158
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,380
or the ethics committee if we're
consulted.

159
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,960
And based on how long a person has known
the patient,

160
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,140
if a person has had conversations with the
patient that might be

161
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,100
relevant to the decision that has to be
made.

162
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,970
And basically if they can act in a way,
what we call substituted judgement,

163
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,730
if they can put themselves in the patients
shoes and

164
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,110
decide what the patient would want.

165
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,570
But it really can be anyone an old friend
a neighbor,

166
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,490
it's just it really is dependent on the
relationship.

167
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,130
But that is certainly not true in other
states.

168
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,440
And there are a number of states in which
next of kin

169
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,290
is automatically the surrogate.

170
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,250
Or spouse is automatically the surrogate.

171
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,120
So it's very important that clinicians
know

172
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,930
what the surrogate decision-maker right,
rules are for their particular state.

173
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,980
>> And that would be a good question for

174
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,200
the medical ethics committee if you're
uncertain.

175
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,170
Is that right?

176
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:32,930
>> Absolutely.

177
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,240
So your medical ethics committee is really
the person or

178
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,310
the group that you can go to when you have
these types of questions.

179
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:44,780
Because they will know state regulations,
federal regulations, and

180
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,480
hospital policies that are all relevant.

181
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,520
To whatever your, your case or issue may
be.

182
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,820
>> So one of, one of the situations that
we deal with a lot in anesthesiology is

183
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:00,890
the spec, the suspension of DNR or DNI
order or the suspension of a patient's

184
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,630
advance directives when it comes to taking
a patient to the operating room.

185
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,910
I'm curious about what the timeframe is
regarding starting that suspension and

186
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,430
when that suspension ends.

187
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,700
Is it something that begins the second
they are on the operating room table and

188
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,070
the moment they reach the recovery room
it's over?

189
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,150
Or what, what are the rules and what are
your guidelines or

190
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,770
recommendations about this?

191
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,960
>> So, there really are no hard and fast
rules and,

192
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,440
as you can imagine, that's highly
dependent on the patient.

193
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,740
In some instances it might be appropriate
to suspend the DNR,

194
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,710
DNI as soon as they get into the operating
room,

195
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,630
and then reactivate it wh, the second they
go into recovery.

196
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,670
In other cases, that's not going to be
appropriate,

197
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,700
because they might still be at risk of
certain things while in recovery.

198
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,920
And so, the most important thing for you
to do in this situation is.

199
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,440
To talk to your patient, or

200
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,780
your patient's surrogate, before you take
them into the operating room.

201
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,260
And make sure that everyone's clear about
how long, or

202
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,140
what's appropriate, in terms of the
suspension of the DNR, DNI order.

203
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,730
>> Okay.
So

204
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,300
the patient has to make the decision
beforehand, and

205
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,465
that's the best way to do it.

206
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,310
>> Mm-hm.

207
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:07,810
Okay.

208
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,275
In, in medical ethics, it just seems
extremely complex.

209
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:14,270
>> Mm-hm.
>> And

210
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,810
when it comes to working with patients and
working with medically complex issues or

211
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,580
ethically complex issues, who should we
rely on?

212
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,290
Because we don't deal with this every
single day in the operating room.

213
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,930
We don't deal with this every day as an
anesthesiologist.

214
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,220
Who can we go to to help us with this?

215
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,340
>> The Medical Ethics Committee is here
for this purpose.

216
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,510
They are here to help doctors navigate the
incredibly complex

217
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,990
situations that they can get in ethically
especially.

218
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,160
They have a lot of resources.

219
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,390
They will know State regulations, hospital
policies, Federal guidelines,

220
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:55,760
specific cases, and they're really there
as a resource for doctors as I said to,

221
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,770
to help you deal with these complex
decisions and help you make the decisions.

222
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,160
So any time you have a question about
something like this.

223
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,720
It's very important that you go to your
hospital ethics committee.

224
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,080
>> Okay.
Well, thank you very much for

225
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,540
your time and for joining me today.

226
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,978
>> Oh, it was wonderful to be here.
