1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,250
In this next module, I'm going to show you
how to control for

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,400
confounding using stratification.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,934
This will get us into the Mantelâ€“Haenszel
statistics.

4
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:16,400
So, getting back to the example that I
introduced in the teaser for

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,650
today, this makes a good example for
illustrating controlling for

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,880
confounding by stratification.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,090
So, again, this example was looking at
potential gender bias in

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,828
graduate school admissions at Berkeley.

9
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:28,590
This is hearkening back to the 1970s,

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,180
but, people were worried when they saw
this data.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,490
There was even a lawsuit and things like
that.

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,660
but, if you look at the data here, this is
some data that somebody compiled for

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,730
one of the years of admission.

14
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,200
The females were applying in fewer numbers
than men.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,460
But, indeed, women were 25% more likely to
be denied admission than men and

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,730
that was the concern.

17
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,940
However, if you think about this example
carefully, especially back thinking about

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,790
in the early 1970s, there is an important
potential confounder here.

19
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,950
You have to look at what departments women
and men are applying to.

20
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,570
Especially back in the 1970s, there was a
big difference between where men and

21
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,370
women were applying and that might
influence denial in admissions rate.

22
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,380
And, indeed, that's what somebody went
back and did with these data.

23
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,790
So now we're going to stratify the data by
department,

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,010
by program that people were applying to.

25
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,890
And I've kept the programs anonymous, so
we won't, criticize any departments.

26
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,350
But you can kind of guess what these
departments might be.

27
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,110
So the first stratum is program A.

28
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,770
And what you look, can see when you look
at the data is that men were much,

29
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,130
much more likely than women to apply to
program A, whatever program A happened to

30
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,910
be, maybe it's something like mathematics
or engineering back in the early 70s.

31
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,840
You can see, though, that once you look
only within program A,

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,920
women were no less likely to get admitted
than men.

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,860
In fact, the risk ratio for denial of
admissions for women versus men is 0.46.

34
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,080
What that tells you is that, actually,
women were a little bit less likely to be

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,068
denied and that's actually statistically
significant within this strata.

36
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:08,690
So once you drill in on program, you're
seeing a different picture.

37
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,830
However, of course, there were very few
women that applied to this program, so

38
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,110
though, even though a lot got in, it still
doesn't represent a huge, number of women.

39
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,810
If you look at program B, you'll notice,

40
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,660
again, very few women applying to this
program.

41
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,640
It's a relatively easy program to get
into, though.

42
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,720
More than half of the people who apply are
getting in.

43
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,790
And that was similar, and stratum one was
also reasonably easy to get into.

44
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,060
But you can see that, again,

45
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,980
women, if anything, are slightly more
likely to get in than men.

46
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,200
The, there appears to be not much of a
difference here.

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,100
If anything, the risk ratio is slightly in
the favor of women.

48
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,830
But easy department to get into relatively
speaking, but

49
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,990
many, many more men are applying than
women.

50
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,890
You could see how this might create a
spurious association.

51
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,990
Now, turn to program C.

52
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,250
This program looks a little different.

53
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,750
Program C is dominated by women.

54
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,770
Many more women are applying, 593 versus
325.

55
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,752
Many more women are applying than men.

56
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:07,900
However, it's a relatively hard program to
get into.

57
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,970
So, for whatever reason,

58
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,650
many more than half of people who apply
are getting denied admissions.

59
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,200
So, a harder program to get into, but more
women are applying.

60
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,990
If you look at that risk ratio,

61
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:22,030
however, gender doesn't seem to make a
difference on admittance within program C.

62
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,500
The risk ratio is 1.05, men and women are
equally likely to get in.

63
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,760
If you then go to program D, women and men
were about equally likely to apply.

64
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,830
Again, the risk ratio is 1.02.

65
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,800
So not much difference in admissions
between men and women.

66
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,560
This was another department that was
relatively hard to get into.

67
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,580
If you look at program E, this one is
again dominated by women, but

68
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,190
hard to get into.

69
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,290
So women are applying to the harder
departments, basically.

70
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,050
393 women versus 191 men.

71
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,370
A lot of people getting denied.

72
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,640
289 denials.

73
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,180
147 denials for the men.

74
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,560
Most people are getting denied.

75
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,495
So hard to get into, but no real
difference between men and women.

76
00:03:57,495 --> 00:04:00,134
That might be something like education or
English.

77
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:04,038
Program F, pretty equal numbers are
getting in between men and women and

78
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:06,540
this one pretty equal numbers are
applying.

79
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,092
Pretty equal numbers are getting in.

80
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:10,210
This apart, department was really hard to
get into.

81
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,450
Very few people got into it.

82
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,490
But women were no less likely than men to
get in.

83
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,730
The risk ratio in this stratum was 1.01,
right around no.

84
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,670
So, there were, if you look across these
six departments, you can see that if

85
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,270
you just report the crude, the unadjusted
risk ratio, not accounting for

86
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,070
programming, it looks like women are more
likely to be denied admissions.

87
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,180
But when you go and look at the stratum
specific relative risks,

88
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,040
the risk ratios, the picture is very
different.

89
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,480
In fact, in all cases, the women are just
about equally likely as the men to get in.

90
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,840
And there's one program where that's not
true, but, in fact,

91
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,170
the women were more likely than the men to
get in.

92
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,680
So the association that we were seeing in
the crude risk ratio just had to

93
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,520
do with the fact that women were applying
to the harder departments to get into and

94
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,490
men were applying to the easier
departments to get into.

95
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,890
Now, that's pretty much the story we can
now apply some formal statistics to

96
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,530
the story though and this brings int he
Mantal-Haenszel statistics.

97
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,630
So there's a couple of different
statistics that we're going to talk about.

98
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,700
So there's something called the
Mantal-Haenszel test of independence.

99
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,680
This is a chi-squared test.

100
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,070
The null hypothesis here is that the
predictor and the outcome

101
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,740
are independent after controlling for or
conditioning on the confounder.

102
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,700
So once we adjust for

103
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,740
program, is gender and, denial of
admissions, is, are those independent?

104
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,620
The null hypothesis is that they're
independent, and

105
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,640
when you do that statistic, it comes out
to be a p value that is non-significant.

106
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,010
So we have no evidence that those things
are not independent.

107
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,740
So we, we're not going to reject the null
hypothesis there.

108
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,030
It looks like they are unrelated.

109
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,140
We can calculate the p value test, but

110
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,460
then it's also nice to always be able to
provide an affect size.

111
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,340
So we're going to provide an affect size
by calculating what's called

112
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,400
a Maentel-Haenszel summary risk ratio.

113
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,380
All this is, is it's taking the
stratum-specific risk ratios that we

114
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,720
just calculated and it's pooling them.

115
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,740
And it comes out here to be 0.95.

116
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,550
Now, if you were just trying to come up
with the statistic on your own,

117
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,200
you might think, well,

118
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,950
the easiest way to do this is to just take
six risk ratios from the six strata.

119
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,140
Add them up and divide by six.

120
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,560
In other words, average them.

121
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,900
And that's almost what we do to pool them.

122
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,670
Except we want to do one little other
thing in here, which is we want to

123
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,110
give a heavier weight to the strata that
have a bigger sample size.

124
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,310
So whichever strata have more people in
them,

125
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,250
that should have a slightly heavier weight
on the risk-ratio estimate.

126
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,490
So what we do is we do a weighted average
of these risk ratios and

127
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,470
I'll show you the formula in a minute.

128
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,860
When we do that here, though, we come up
with 0.95.

129
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,330
The confidence interval's quite tight
around one.

130
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,270
That's showing you and then you can kind
of,

131
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:47,050
if you eyeball these risk ratios, it looks
like 0.95 would be a good pooling.

132
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,760
A good summary risk ratio.

133
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,630
So, again, this we would call "adjusted
for program".

134
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,040
When the risk ratio is adjusted for

135
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,220
program, we're finding no difference
between men and women.

136
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,180
This tells us that we thought we saw an
association between gender and whether or

137
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,290
not you were denied admission to Berkeley,
but, in fact, once we accounted for

138
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:08,080
confounding by program, that, association
completely disappears.

139
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,190
Our p value is non-significant and our
risk ratio is very close to one.

140
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,920
Now I'm just going to walk you

141
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,400
through the actual mathematical details of
these tests.

142
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,210
So we're going to start with the p value
test,

143
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,470
the Mantel-Haenszel test of conditional
independence.

144
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,400
This is actually a chi-squared test.

145
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,030
Sometimes it's called the
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic.

146
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,340
Sometimes an additional statistician's
name is thrown on the front.

147
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,040
I tend to be lazy and just call it
Mantel-Haenszel because it's shorter, but

148
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,560
you'll see, for example, in SAS, you have
to ask for the CMH statistic.

149
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,820
So the C is the Cochran.

150
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,840
So you'll see it both ways.

151
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,850
So I just want to point out you might see
it, as Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel.

152
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,580
Those are the same, though.

153
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,470
Again, the null hypothesis for this test
is that the predictor and

154
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,130
the outcome are independent after you've
accounted for the confounder.

155
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,110
So when conditioned on the confounder.

156
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,760
So, again, null hypothesis, that after
conditioning for

157
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,840
the confounder, the predictor and the
outcome are independent.

158
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,420
We can see that mathematically, so what do
we mean by statistical independence?

159
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,090
I've gone over this before, but

160
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,630
by statistical independence, we mean that
the joint probability of A and

161
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,270
B is equal to the product of the marginal
probabilities of A and B.

162
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,840
That's what we mean by statistical
independence.

163
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,580
All we're saying here is that you have to
first condition on the confounder whether

164
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,910
or not somebody has the confounder, if you
have a binary confounder,

165
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,060
as I'm showing here.

166
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,640
Once you condition on a confounder, then
statistical independence between A and

167
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,880
B holds.

168
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,810
That's the null hypothesis, and indeed we
saw here that when we

169
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,400
run the Mantel-Haenszel Test, we have no
evidence against that null hypothesis.

170
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,460
It, indeed, looks like they're independent
after we control for program.

171
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,350
Let me walk you now through all the
nitty-gritty mathematical details.

172
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,660
I am probably not going to make you do too
many of these by hand, because,

173
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,610
as you'll see, they're a little tedious to
calculate.

174
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,365
But I actually think it's important for
you to look into the black box here and

175
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:06,120
know what's actually happening, in terms
of calculations in this statistic.

176
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,860
It'll give us a little bit of insight into
the statistic to see what's going on.

177
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,356
It's also useful to just go through the
math here because the Mantel-Haenszel

178
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:19,950
test, we're applying it here to the
context of confounding.

179
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,640
But the Mantelâ€“Haenszel test actually has
a broader application,

180
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,350
it's more general than that.

181
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,164
It's going to come up again in the Spring
term when we

182
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:29,576
talk about Kaplan-Meier statistics, so

183
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:33,650
the log rate test is actually a
Mantelâ€“Haenszel test, same formula.

184
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,070
It also comes up in meta analysis, that
that gets applied to meta analysis,

185
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,920
that same formula.

186
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,480
So it's just worth you having gone through
this formula once or

187
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,210
twice and having a basic understanding of
what's going on here.

188
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,680
So let me just walk you through that, that
nitty-gritty details here.

189
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,380
So how do we run this test?

190
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:50,980
By hand.

191
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,640
So what we're going to do is we're
going to divide our

192
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,480
data up into the different strata.

193
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,170
So, by k here I mean just the number of
strata.

194
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,950
So there's k strata, in the Berkeley
example, there were six strata, so

195
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,970
k would be equal to six.

196
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,000
We start with, say the first stratum and
we look at,

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,590
we make a two by two table for that first
stratum as I did in the Berkeley example.

198
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,690
We can call those cells a, b, c, and d.

199
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,560
Usually, the a cell we call that, you
know, the disease exposed cell

200
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,080
which just means, you know, denial and
gender, the two things we care about.

201
00:10:20,224 --> 00:10:21,516
And then in Nk here,

202
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:26,780
I'm going to use to represent the total
number in a particular stratum.

203
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,140
So we start with, say, the first strata.

204
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,370
And what we're going to plug into this
formula here is we're going to look at

205
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,048
the observed number in cell a.

206
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:36,560
Technically, we could've chosen to focus
on any one of these four cells and say,

207
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,420
"A, a is the most interesting, we're
going to use a".

208
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,120
This table has only one degree of freedom,
though,

209
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,680
so any of the other cells would give us
the equivalent answer.

210
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,070
So we're going to plug in the actual
observed number, so

211
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,780
this is the observed, the observed number
for

212
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,610
cell a in stratum k, that's all that
little subscript k means there.

213
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,030
We're going to do that first.

214
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,140
Then we're going to calculate the expected
count for that cell.

215
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,820
And we're going to do that in the exact
same way we've done when we've

216
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,650
talked about chi-squared tests.

217
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:07,730
So, to calculate the expected value of a
in a particular stratum,

218
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:13,940
we're just going to do the row one, the
row times the column,

219
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,030
total divided by the total in that
stratum.

220
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,020
That will give me the expected value of
cell a,

221
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,180
as we talked about when we talked about
the chi-squared statistic last week.

222
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,080
So I calculated that expected value.

223
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,990
I plug that in here and then,

224
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,770
notice, I am going to view this as a
summation sign here.

225
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,950
So I'm going to be doing this for all six
strata, or all K strata, if we want to be

226
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,730
more general, and I'm taking the observed,
I'm subtracting from the expected.

227
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:44,750
And then I'm adding all of those observed
minus expecteds up across all the strata,

228
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,310
and then I'm squaring that after the fact.

229
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,040
That's the numerator.

230
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,880
What's the denominator?

231
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,490
The denominator is calculated by typing
the variance of a.

232
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,150
Now I haven't told you how to calculate
the variance of a.

233
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,920
So I'm going to give you the formula now.

234
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,540
Again it's a little bit tedious, but
basically we're going to calculate this

235
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,180
variance term for every strata and then
just add them up.

236
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,770
That becomes the denominator.

237
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,390
So here is the formula for the variance.

238
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,990
I'm showing you the expected value formula
here,

239
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,890
I've already talked about that, and here's
the formula for the variance.

240
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:16,500
It looks rather cumbersome, but this is
just row one times row two,

241
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,030
times column one, times column two,
divided by n squared, times n minus one.

242
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,320
And we do this again, specific to each
strata.

243
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,380
A little tedious to calculate.

244
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,730
I'll just tell you where this comes from.

245
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,267
We happened to have a situation here where
we ha-,

246
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:33,020
we are on a hyper-geometric dias-,
distribution.

247
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,020
That distribution comes with a variance.

248
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,640
And that's the variance for that
distribution.

249
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,040
I won't go into more detail on it,.

250
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
You're not going to have to do too many of
these by hand, fortunately.

251
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,810
But that is the variance of a.

252
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,810
So we're going to add those all up.

253
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,050
That makes the denominator.

254
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,210
This turns out to have a chi-square with
one degree of freedom distribution under

255
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:49,990
the null hypothesis.

256
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,430
Why is this a chi-square with one degree
of freedom?

257
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,330
I'm going to take a few minutes now to
just explain why this is

258
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,390
a chi square with one degree of freedom.

259
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,550
If your head is swimming with summation
tides of this,

260
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,908
really, just you don't care about this
mathematical detail,

261
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:08,870
it's not absolutely essential, you can
scroll forward on the video if you want.

262
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,425
But I just think its really cool to point
out exactly why this falls at

263
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,350
chi-square with one degree of freedom.

264
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,480
This gets a little bit mathy, but I think
is interesting to see walked through.

265
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,440
So where does this come from?

266
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,470
How come this statistic comes out to be a
chi-square with one degree of freedom?

267
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,460
Well, I'm just going to rewrite this
formula a little bit for you.

268
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,250
So, I'm going to take everything in this
square and

269
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,640
just leave this square for the moment.

270
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,970
If I'm just kind of looking at this, what
I'm

271
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,560
doing is I'm adding up the observed minus
the expected in each cell, each stratum.

272
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,170
But that's the same as just adding up all
the observed and then subtracting from

273
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,520
the sum of all the expected, right, I can
distribute this summation sign.

274
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,130
So I, another way I can write this is I
can just say that this

275
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:53,930
is the sum of the observed cells across
each, observed cells A's across each of

276
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,940
the different strata if I just add them
up, so it's a sum of A's.

277
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,790
That's my observed.

278
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,050
And then I'm going to rewrite my expected
term a little bit.

279
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:06,895
So I have a sum of expected values here,
but hopefully you know from a previous

280
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:12,940
statistics course that the sum of expected
values is the expected value of the sum.

281
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:16,920
OK, just bear with me for a minute more
here.

282
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,930
So we've got an observed minus and
expected.

283
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,060
If I just say, you know, that the sum of a
is the thing I care about,

284
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,101
I have an observed minus and expected in
the numerator.

285
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:25,980
And then what about the denominator?

286
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,070
Well, hopefully you remember from a
previous statistics class that the sum of

287
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,390
variances is the variances of the sum, if
you have independent things,

288
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,300
which we do have here.

289
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,550
So I can rewrite the denominator also as
the variance of the sum of a case.

290
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:48,390
So now we've got an observed minus an
expected squared divided by a variance.

291
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:54,040
Well, that happens to have a chi-square,
with one degree of freedom distribution.

292
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,160
And I can show you that very easily by
just reminding you that,

293
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,000
if I square root everything, I should end
up with a z-square.

294
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,728
So I'm now going to take the square root
of this whole term.

295
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:05,630
So I'm going to get rid of the square on
the numerator and

296
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,110
I'm going to take the square root of the
denominator.

297
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,450
So what do I have now?

298
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,430
I've got a sum of a, that's my observed,
minus the expected value of

299
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:18,440
that same quantity divided by the standard
deviation of that same quantity.

300
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,660
So I have an observed minus an expected
divided by a standard deviation.

301
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,630
Well, we know that an observed minus an
expected divided by its

302
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,940
standard deviation is just a Z statistic.

303
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,090
That's just a standard normal.

304
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,220
So we've proven that this is actually just
a Z square, but I told you last week

305
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,630
that if you square a Z, you end up on a
chi-square with one degree of freedom.

306
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,630
And so that's why this is a chi-square
with one degree of freedom.

307
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,400
So, again, a little bit of mathematical
detail there, but

308
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,260
I think useful to kind of think that
through.

309
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,160
Now, I'm just going to actually plug in
numbers into this formula.

310
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,840
You'll see that I got a little bored of
plugging in the numbers.

311
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,820
So, yeah, you have to back to the slides
where I give the actual numbers in all of

312
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,590
those two by two tables, the, you know,

313
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,970
first cell a, was 19 and so on and so
forth.

314
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,320
I started plugging them in and then I, it
was rather tedious.

315
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,440
So I have to admit that I didn't actually
plug and check all these numbers.

316
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,080
I put the data into SAS, and I let SAS
calculate out this chi-square for me.

317
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,790
SAS spit out 1.49.

318
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,880
I'm going to trust that SAS did the adding
and subtracting correctly here.

319
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,620
So I have a chi-square with one degree of
freedom.

320
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,370
My value comes out to be 1.49.

321
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,460
I could take that and go to a chi-square
chart, or,

322
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,360
of course, in SAS, I'm also going to get
the P-value spit out to me,

323
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,404
so SAS told me that corresponding P-value
is 0.22.

324
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:40,380
I'll just point out that you won't really
need to go to a statistical chart here to

325
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,160
know that this is going to be
statistically significant.

326
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,818
So you know a chi-square with one degree
of freedom is just a Z square and,

327
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:50,771
if I square root 1.49, I'm certainly
going to come up with something that's

328
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:55,320
less than 1.96 and we know a Z of 1.96 is
the cut off for statistical significance.

329
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,380
So that's one way to know that this is not
going to be significant.

330
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,230
You can also reach for what I talked about
last week, that a chi-square with one

331
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,230
degree of freedom, the expected value's
going to be one, and the variance is

332
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,430
going to be two times the degrees of
freedom, so that's going to be two.

333
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,190
So if the expected value here is one and

334
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,740
the variance is two, that means the
standard deviation's about 1.7.

335
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,830
We know that 1.49 is not going to be
anywhere near the tail of

336
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,590
that distribution.

337
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,130
So it's clear that that's not going to be
statistically significant.

338
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,900
Indeed, the P value comes out to be 0.22.

339
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,930
We have no evidence that gender and
admissions are related,

340
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,390
after adjusting for program.

341
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,300
And, agan, I got SAS to do this for me.

342
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,280
So, in SAS,

343
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,530
it's just the first row of this output of
the Mantel-Haenszel Statistic.

344
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,950
There are slightly different versions of
the Mantel-Haenszel Statistic, but

345
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,910
you can see that here, this simple case,
everything comes out the same.

346
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,230
We're just going to pick the first line
there.

347
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:48,560
Now, let me tell you how to calculate that
Mantel-Haenszel summary odds ratio or

348
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,300
risk ratio.

349
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,420
This, of course, only applies to two by
two tables because we can only calculate

350
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,740
risk ratios or odds ratios from two by two
tables.

351
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,410
So, a little caveat here.

352
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,080
We want to calculate summary odds ratios
if the relative risk,

353
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,740
the risk ratios of the odds ratios are
homogenous across the different strata.

354
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,120
That, it wouldn't, it wouldn't seem really
fair to pool them,

355
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,720
if there was interaction going on or
effect modification going on here.

356
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,160
In other words, if the relationship
between the predictor and

357
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,641
the outcome was different in different
strata, it doesn't seem like it would be

358
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:25,450
fair to pool them to come up with a single
summary odds ratio or risk ratio.

359
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,870
So we're, in a minute I'm going to show
you how to evaluate whether or

360
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,750
not we have interaction going on.

361
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,540
If we don't have interaction going on,

362
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,410
then it seems fair to pool them, so how
are we going to pool them?

363
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,860
So here's the formula [SOUND] that we're
going to use to pool them.

364
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,465
it's, again, a little tedious to
calculate, but

365
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:44,290
not too hard to understand, so we're just
kind of walking through what we're doing.

366
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,100
It's just calculating weighted average.

367
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,007
I'm going to start with the odds ratio
because the odds ratio,

368
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:50,610
is slightly simpler.

369
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,350
So what are you looking at here?

370
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,920
So what we're doing in the numerator is
we're, again, summing up over k strata.

371
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,898
So we've got, in the Berkeley example,

372
00:18:58,898 --> 00:19:01,450
we have six strata, we're going to sum up
over the six strata.

373
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,980
So k just represents the number of strata.

374
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,571
The Ti I'm using to represent the total
sample size in the ith stratum, and

375
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:10,030
that's what I was calling nk before.

376
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,940
Same thing.

377
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,390
So that's the total sample size in the ith
stratum.

378
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,820
So we're just going to go through and

379
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,050
we're going to, in the numerator, we're
going to add up for each strata.

380
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,890
We're going to start, say, with the first
stratum, we're going to do a times d,

381
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,460
which is the numerator when odds ratio.

382
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,150
But then we're going to weight it by
dividing by the total number in that

383
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,260
strata, whatever that number happens to
be.

384
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,140
And then we're going to do that for all
six stratum and

385
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,240
add them up, that constitutes the
numerator.

386
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,570
We're going to do something very similar
in the denominator but

387
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,960
we're going to use b times c which is the
denominator of.

388
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,610
An odds ratio.

389
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,010
And you'll see that if you look at the
formula for

390
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,530
an odds ratio, it looks very similar to
the formula here,

391
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,460
we're just weighting by the size of the
strata, and averaging over all the strata.

392
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,240
So that's how you calculate the
Mantel-Haenszel summary odds ratio.

393
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,080
At the end of this module,

394
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,968
I'll walk you through an actual example if
you want to see some numbers put to that.

395
00:19:55,968 --> 00:20:01,888
Now, the Mantel-Haenszel summary risk
ratio is only slightly more complicated.

396
00:20:01,888 --> 00:20:06,090
So, the Mantel-Haenszel summary risk
ratio.

397
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,000
We're, we're going to do the same kind of
thing.

398
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,810
Except now you can see that the numerators
are slightly more complicated here.

399
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,720
W're going to take a in the first straum
for exmpale and

400
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,790
multiply it times the total number of
unexposed c plus d.

401
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,080
And then but again we're dividing by to
wait by the total in the stratum.

402
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,180
We're adding up over all the different
stratum.

403
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,754
But where does this a times c plus d comes
from actually.

404
00:20:27,754 --> 00:20:32,450
If you look at the formula for a risk
ratio, it falls out on that pretty easily.

405
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,090
So coming to the risk ratio, we want to
know,

406
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,220
what is out of everybody is exposed?,

407
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,500
what percent that the disease.

408
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,660
So that's just a divided by a plus b.

409
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,290
For the denominator we want to know how
many,

410
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,070
what percent got the disease out of
everybody who was not exposed to that.

411
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,920
That's just c divided by c plus d.

412
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,230
Well if you slightly rearrange this
formula.

413
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,450
You end up seeing that that's equivalent
to a times c plus d in the numerator,

414
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,130
divided by c times a plus b in the
denominator.

415
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,470
And that's where we're getting these
numerators.

416
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,880
And the rest is the same.

417
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,200
We're just going to plug into that as we
would do with the odds.

418
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,770
Ratio.
Again,

419
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,520
I'll walk you through in a miracle example
in a minute.

420
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,040
You won't have to do too many of these by
hand.

421
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,470
But it's good to just see where it comes
from.

422
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,030
So here is, I'm actually going to walk you
through [SOUND] plugging in the data for

423
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,190
Berkeley example.

424
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,040
This wasn't too hard.

425
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,856
I actually went through and plugged in all
the numbers.

426
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:25,130
In the first stratum, for example,

427
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:31,150
19 was your" a cell," 933 was the total,
and 825 was the,

428
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,450
in this case, the total number of men who
had applied to that program.

429
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,750
You're going to do that for all six
strata.

430
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,740
And then add them up for the numerator.

431
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,050
Similar to for the denominator.

432
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,870
And when I this all, it comes out to be
0.95.

433
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,330
I'm not going to give you the formula to
get the confidence limits.

434
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,260
I am, it's it's obviously if it's this
hard to calculate the risk ratio itself,

435
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,130
it's going to be even more complicated.

436
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,640
To calculate confidence limits by hand,

437
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,730
you're not going to have to do that by
hand.

438
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,640
I'm going to allow the computer to do that
for me.

439
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,410
Luckily we have computers to do that for
us and indeed if I ask for

440
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,450
the Mantel-Haenszel summary statistics,
what I'm going to get here.

441
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,370
Is I'm, I want the cohort one because
that's the risk ratio I,

442
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,600
I don't need the odds ratio here because I
don't have a case control study.

443
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,178
I get that 0.95 which I just calculated,
and my confidence limits turn out to be

444
00:22:17,178 --> 00:22:22,240
0.87 to 1.03 pretty tightly around 1
because they have fairly large numbers and

445
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,550
clearly it Includes one so this is not
statistically significant.

446
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,180
If you're just curious what else is in
this chart here.

447
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,440
This logit here just means that sas
actually went ahead and

448
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,760
ran a logistic regression to adjust her
program.

449
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,930
Something we're going to do pretty soon.

450
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,980
And it's spitting out the results from
that logistic regression.

451
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,300
we're, we don't, we're not going to choose
that from the output here.

452
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,210
But just notice that we can also adjust
for her program.

453
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,010
For the confounder by regression by
logistic regression.

454
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,180
Which.
We're going to do in the upcoming weeks.

455
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,850
Alright, so just to summarize, we started
with an adjusted risk ratio of 1.25.

456
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,680
It looked like being a woman was going to
to decrease your likelihood of

457
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,740
getting into [SOUND] Berkely Graduate
School.

458
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,850
The stratum specific relative risks are
shown here.

459
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,550
We saw that once we looked in individual
programs,

460
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,990
it didn't look like there was much of a
relationship.

461
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,608
Between gender and your admissions.

462
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:15,410
Except potentially [SOUND] in the very
first round where it looked better to

463
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,880
be a woman in that case.

464
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,130
When we calculate that [UNKNOWN] risk
ratio it comes out to

465
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,160
be very close to one.

466
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,700
Now the question that we haven't dealt
with that we need to deal with.

467
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,490
And I've pooled the risk ratios as if we
have

468
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,490
homogeneity across the different strata.

469
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,680
In other words, as if we don't have any
interaction or

470
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,480
affect modification going on here.

471
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,580
But you'll notice that one of the stratum
does look different.

472
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:42,150
So potentially we may have a significant
interaction by program here, so

473
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,330
we need to actually evaluate a test for
that.

474
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,740
So how do we test for effect modification
or interaction?

475
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,800
So in the case of just looking at
stratified contingency tables,

476
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,640
the test that we're going to use is
something called the Breslow-Day test

477
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,270
for homogeneity.

478
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,500
The null hypothesis here is that we have,
do not have interaction, so

479
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,010
that the, that is that the risk ratios or
odds ratios are homogenous.

480
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,295
Across the different strata.

481
00:24:07,295 --> 00:24:09,240
If we reject this test, if we reject this

482
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,010
null hypothesis then that would indicate
that we do have interaction.

483
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,070
I am not going to make you do the
[UNKNOWN] test by hand.

484
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,470
The formula is rather complicated.

485
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,650
It's even worse that I've kind of
summarized it quickly here, but

486
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,360
it's even worse than this.

487
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,140
You're not going to have to do it by hand.

488
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,480
But it's just evaluating whether or

489
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,804
not the effect size is the same across the
different strata.

490
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:33,970
If the [UNKNOWN] comes up significant then
we do have effect modification.

491
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,020
So what happens here?

492
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,710
Well, I ran this in SAS, I did not do this
by hand, I ran the reso

493
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,300
day test in SAS and the p value d comes
out significant for the Berkeley example.

494
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,120
So it turns out that program, what
department.

495
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,810
You're applying to.

496
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:53,370
That variable is both a confounder and an
effect modifier.

497
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,950
And this can happen, and that's important
to really understand,

498
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,870
is that variables can be both confounders
and effect modifiers.

499
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,680
And that is what happened in this case.

500
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,240
So argueably, because cell a is different
than the other strata,

501
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,270
we might not want to report a, a pooled.

502
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:15,520
Risk ratio here because we'd be missing
something of an important effect.

503
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,020
So if you look again look at the stratum
specific risk ratios,

504
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,490
probably these all look homogeneous.

505
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,330
This one looks different.

506
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:26,700
And indeed, the Breslow-Day test rejects,
saying we have interaction by the program.

507
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,060
The program modifies the effect of gender
on admissions because this

508
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,380
one program looks different than the
others.

509
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,860
So combining the risk ratios into a single
summary risk ratio might

510
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,860
actually obscure that there's a pro female
bias in program A.

511
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,010
We're missing some things.

512
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,170
You always want to make sure you test for
interaction.

513
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,120
And if there is interaction, you probably
want to just report

514
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,280
the stratum specific risk ratios instead
of reporting the pooled one.

515
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,620
I just want to end here with another
example where I

516
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,400
actually go through a case control study,
just to show you how to

517
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,900
actually apply the Mandel Hansel odds
ratio formula numerically.

518
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,380
So just to give you some example data from
a case control study,

519
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,860
here's a study that was looking at whether
or

520
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,820
not, if your spouse smokes, does that
increase your risk of lung cancer?

521
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,990
So if you don't smoke but your spouse.

522
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,850
Spouse does, does that increase your risk
of lung cancer.

523
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,740
They did this as a case control study
because lung cancer is relatively rare,

524
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,680
so it's much more efficient to go out and
find lung cancer cases and

525
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,610
then compare them to controls.

526
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,190
This was done across multiple countries,
however.

527
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,170
And there was some concern that they might
be confounding by country,

528
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:34,970
because if you are in a country with
[UNKNOWN] with very high air pollution, or

529
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,660
with very high background rates of
smoking.

530
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,660
Perhaps whether or not your spouse smokes
doesn't make a big difference on your

531
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,000
lung cancer risk, whereas if you're in a
country with low background rates of

532
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,240
air pollution and smoking maybe it makes
more of a difference.

533
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,450
.
That was the thought.

534
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,500
So we have to consider potential
confounding.

535
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,520
Country.

536
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,140
So, here's the stratified analysis.

537
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,340
When you look at the individual countries
in

538
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,760
the strata from the individual countries,
actually,

539
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,070
the odds ratio comes out to be very
similar across all three countries.

540
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,700
It does indeed look like spousal smoking
increases your risk of

541
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,630
lung cancer a moderate amount.

542
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,560
Not a huge odds ratio.

543
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,140
Ratios, but somewhat.

544
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,720
And it looks pretty similar across the
different countries.

545
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,870
So the odds ratios are 1.5, 1.6, and 1.3.

546
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,660
In my mind, those effect sizes are pretty
similar.

547
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,950
And I'm not going to expect the [UNKNOWN]
test to come out significant here.

548
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,000
Those look fairly homogenous.

549
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,480
Do this.

550
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,480
Now I went ahead and ran all of these
statistics just for practice here.

551
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,020
So I ran the Cochran Mantel Haenszel test
of conditional independence.

552
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,560
This is the chisper test.

553
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,330
The null hypothesis here would be that
spousal smoking is unrelated to lung.

554
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,285
This comes out statistically significant.

555
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:42,040
.0196.
So therefor we have evidence that

556
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,140
spousal smoking is actually.

557
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,870
Actually related to lung cancer.

558
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,720
It does appear to increase your risk
somewhat.

559
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,460
Then I ran the Breslw-Day test of
homogeneity.

560
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,330
This one comes about to be
non-significant.

561
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,140
The P value's .88.

562
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,160
Well, that's expected, right,

563
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,850
because the odds ratios look pretty
similar across the different strata.

564
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,820
We don't have any evidence of interaction
by what country you're in.

565
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,640
That would mean that it's probably okay
to.

566
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,170
Calculate a summary odds ratio here.

567
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:12,170
So now I'm just going to walk you through
how to calculate that summary odds ratio.

568
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,820
I'll show you the SAS output, because I'm
not going to do the confidence limits by

569
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,930
hand, so when I do this in SAS the summary
odds ratio is about 1.38.

570
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,270
The confidence limits go from 1.04 to
1.82,

571
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,880
in other words, 1.0 is not within the
confidence interval.

572
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,190
This is a statistically significant odds
ratio.

573
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,050
I'm just going to walk you through how to
numerically how to

574
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,330
plug into this formula just so you've seen
it once so

575
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:38,100
here it is again the Mantel-Haenszel
summary odds ratio formula.

576
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,890
To plug into it I've put the data from the
three a strata here so

577
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,550
you can see how I'm plugging into this
formula its not too terribly hard.

578
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:52,440
So for the first strata, there was a total
of 364 people in that first strata.

579
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,230
To do A times D is just 73 times 82,
divided by the total which was 364.

580
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,350
We do that again for

581
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:02,200
the second strata, 19 times 16 divided by
total in that strata, which was 78.

582
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,120
And so on, and so forth.

583
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,770
You just plug into that formula.

584
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,610
When I do that I come out indeed with a.

585
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,480
Odds ratio of about 1.38.

586
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,760
And that actually makes a lot of sense,
right?

587
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,644
If you think about, we had odds ratios of
about 1.5, 1.6, and

588
00:29:16,644 --> 00:29:20,220
1.3 from the, the three countries.

589
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,510
The biggest country was the US.

590
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,970
That's quite a bit, has a quite a bit
bigger sample size, so

591
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,310
we think that the weighted average should
be a little closer to the US value of 1.3.

592
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:32,470
But it's going to be a little bit higher
1.3 because the other countries had

593
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,760
slightly higher values.

594
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,940
So 1.38 makes good sense as being a
reasonable summary odds ratio here.

595
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,145
And I'll just end by saying that you're
not going to see a lot of

596
00:29:43,145 --> 00:29:46,110
Mantel-Haenszel statistics in a lot of
papers.

597
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:49,080
You're probably not going to end up
publishing a paper that

598
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,910
uses Mantel-Haenszel statistics.

599
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:54,650
That's simply because we can do most of
the adjustment for confounding and testing

600
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:57,630
for interaction within a regression, which
is what we're going to do in the next.

601
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,780
Next couple of weeks.

602
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,610
But I still think it's actually useful to
walk through the Mantel-Haenszel test,

603
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,680
because sometimes it's actually nice to go
back to looking at

604
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,000
something in a stratified analysis.

605
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,500
It's a little bit more hands on and

606
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,500
a little more intuitive than just throwing
things in a regression.

607
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,680
As I mentioned earlier, also,

608
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,230
the Mantel-Haenszel test is more general
than just controlling for confounding.

609
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,650
So it's going to come up in some other
contexts.

610
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,970
And then, finally.

611
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,910
I think just looking through the
Mantel-Haenszel and

612
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,840
the stratification picture gives you

613
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,120
an intuitive sense of how we adjust for
confounding.

614
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,420
How we adjust for confounding is actually
simiilar in the regression picture.

615
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,240
So in the stratified analysis,

616
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,300
what we're doing is we're saying we're
going to hold smoking [UNKNOWN].

617
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,450
We're only going to compare smokers to
smokers.

618
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,150
And we're only going to compare nonsmokers
to nonsmokers.

619
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,500
When we then move to continuous
confounders, which we will do in

620
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,480
the regression picture, it's going to be
very similar, except,

621
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,550
when we're talking about continuous
confounders, what we're literally meaning,

622
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:01,030
that, mathematically, what we're Staying
in the regression model is something like.

623
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,450
If I'm adjusting for age for exmaple.

624
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,740
I only want to compare twenty year olds to
twenty year olds.

625
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,850
Or I only compare 21 year olds to 21 year
olds.

626
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,850
Of course your dataset may not have a
whole bunch of twenty year olds or

627
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,380
it might not have a bunch of 21 year olds.

628
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,220
So you're not litereally comparing them
form year sample, but

629
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,520
your mathematically setting up a model.

630
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,330
That allows you to say I only want to I
want a whole age fix, and

631
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,500
only compare people of the same ages.

632
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,160
Essentially that's what we're doing in
regression to sort of

633
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,510
we're taking the limit of what we were
doing in the stratified picture.

634
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:33,070
So it's kind of nice to see the, the
stratified methods first because what

635
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,240
we're doing in the regression is actually
very similar but just a.

636
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,200
Its a taken a a step further.
