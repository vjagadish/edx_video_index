1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,640
In our final analysis, we're interested in
studying BMI.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,770
We also want to chop up the continuous
variables, so

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,650
that we can study them as categorical
predictors.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,120
Let's start by creating a new variable for
BMI.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,390
In our data set, we have weight in pounds
and height in centimeters.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,000
In order to calculate BMI, we need to take
weight in

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,900
kilograms divided by height squared, where
height is in meters.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,410
So first, we need to convert pounds to
kilograms and centimeters to meters.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,340
Let's do this in a data step.

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,220
First, we create a new data set called
BMI.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,140
And we fill in the data from a clean
diabetes data set.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,059
Then, we create new variables for weight
and height.

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,570
Since there is about 2.2 pounds for every
kilogram,

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,290
if we divide weight in pounds by 2.2 we'll
convert it to kilograms.

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,880
Likewise, since there's 100 centimeters
per meter,

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,710
if we divide our original height by 100,
we'll convert it to meters.

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,750
Then we use a drop statement to remove the
variables in their original units,

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,850
since we don't need them anymore.

19
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,010
As you can see, we now have a new variable
for weight and

20
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,710
height, now in the correct units.

21
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,060
Here we're going to continue working on
our BMI dataset.

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,430
We'll use a set statement to fill in the
data we just created.

23
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,170
Now we create a new variable for BMI.

24
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,080
BMI is equal to weight over height
squared, where weight is in kilograms and

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,650
height is in meters.

26
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,440
One way to specify exponential in SAS, is
by using a double asterisk.

27
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,360
So here in the denominator we have height,
underscore meters, double asterisk 2.

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,920
Which means height squared, just like we
want it.

29
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,690
We also want to reorder the variables in
our dataset.

30
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,040
We can do this with a retain statement.

31
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,730
Remember a retain statement must come at
the top of the data step, or

32
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,750
else it won't work correctly.

33
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,220
So first we'll have the diabetic outcome
variable, followed by BMI.

34
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,750
Then weight, height and age.

35
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,450
And then the rest of the variables will
remain in the dataset,

36
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,475
in their default order.

37
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:57,340
[SOUND].

38
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,330
As you can see, we now have a new variable
for BMI.

39
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,760
And we've changed the order of the
variables.

40
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,170
>> Now let's chop up our continuous
variables, so

41
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,010
that we can study them as categorical
predictors.

42
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,380
As you may recall, we showed you how you
can do this using PROC RANKS.

43
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,390
This can create groups for continuous
predictors.

44
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,360
Say we're interested in quartiles for age
and BMI.

45
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,210
Let's take a look at the code.

46
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,410
This PROC RANK code might look familiar.

47
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,370
First we specify our original dataset,
BMI.

48
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,680
And then we have to specify an output
dataset using out equals, and

49
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,610
then the name, BMI_quartiles, in our case.

50
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,690
Then, the group statement allows us to
create categories.

51
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,078
Groups equal 100 allows you to create
percentiles.

52
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:41,520
And in our case, groups equals 4 creates
quartiles.

53
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,280
We then need to specify the variables of
interest using var.

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,080
Var analysis we included var, age and bmi.

55
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,570
It's important to remember a rank
statement.

56
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,080
This will create separate variables that
contain the categories for quartiles age,

57
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,040
and quartiles BMI.

58
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,230
Without these, our age and BMI variables
would be replaced by the categories.

59
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,790
Lets run this code and take a look at the
output.

60
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,230
As you can see, we now have two new
variables.

61
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,030
The first variable is labeled ranks for
variable age.

62
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,350
And the second is labeled ranks for
variable BMI.

63
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,430
These categories can now be used in our
analysis.
