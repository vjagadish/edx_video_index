1
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,190
Welcome to week nine of statistics in
medicine.

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,700
This is the final week of the course.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,130
So, congratulations on making it this far.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,358
This week we're going to continue our
discussion of regression.

5
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to move beyond linear
regression and

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,465
talk about some more sophisticated
regression models.

7
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:28,950
Specifically, I'm going to be talking
about logistic regression and

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,400
cox regression.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,400
These are some more advanced statistical
models that are just a little bit

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,380
more complicated than linear regression.

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,890
I'm also going to keep talking about some
basic concepts of

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:46,095
regression modelling that apply to all
regression models.

13
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:52,370
We've covered a lot of this big
statistical chart now.

14
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,090
Last week we talked about linear
correlation and linear regression.

15
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,240
This week we're going to talk about
logistic regression.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,890
This is the regression technique that's
used when you

17
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,450
have a binary outcome variable.

18
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,520
The basic logistic regression model that
we're going to talk about this week is for

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,800
independent, when you have independent
observations.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,590
I'm going to briefly mention this week
that there is an alternative test when you

21
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,000
have correlated observation.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,110
And you want to do regression modeling
with a binary outcome variable.

23
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,360
That's something called conditional
logistic regression.

24
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,460
I'm just going to point it out, I won't go
into any details about the model.

25
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,100
I also want to point out now that there's
something called GEE models,

26
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,979
which can also be used when you have
correlated observations and

27
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,740
a binary outcome variable.

28
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,810
I'll also point out to you.

29
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,970
We talked last week about linear
regression with independent observations.

30
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:50,690
What about the situation when you have a
continuous outcome variable.

31
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,480
You want to do regression analysis but

32
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,670
your observations are correlated in some
way.

33
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,050
Then you're going to need some more
sophisticated models,

34
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,270
called either mixed models or GEE models.

35
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,310
Both of those will work in that situation.

36
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,810
Again, I'm not going to go into any
details, of those models.

37
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,420
They're beyond the scope of this course.

38
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,090
But I'll just point them out to you, so

39
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,820
that you know that there is a test
available in those situations.

40
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,990
And you can take a more advanced
statistical course to learn about

41
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,210
the details of those.

42
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:22,440
This week I'm also going to talk in great
detail about Cox regression.

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,570
That's the regression analysis technique
that you're going to use when you

44
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,250
have time-to-event outcomes.

45
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,490
So when you're doing survival analysis.

46
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:36,400
The teaser for this week comes from a 2009
study that made headlines.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,860
The study found that eating a lot of red
meat was linked to

48
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,970
an increased risk of death.

49
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,420
An increased mortality risk.

50
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,020
Again, the study made a lot of headlines.

51
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,310
I'm quoting here from nbcnews.com, they
write.

52
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,120
The largest study of it's kind,

53
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,357
finds that older Americans who eat large
amounts of red meat and

54
00:02:56,357 --> 00:03:00,260
processed meats face a greater risk of
death from heart disease and cancer.

55
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,400
So they found that there was the people
who were eating a lot of

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,845
red meat were at an increased risk of
dying from heart disease and cancer.

57
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:12,730
But, this was an observational study, and
it turns out that

58
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:18,790
people who eat a lot of red meat tend to
do a lot of other unhealthy things.

59
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,690
So, red meat eating clusters pretty
heavily with un,

60
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,575
other unhealthy behaviors.

61
00:03:24,575 --> 00:03:27,766
And this is an example that I actually
showed you

62
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:32,360
before in week two of the course when I
was talking about confounding.

63
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,410
So this is a very good example of
confounding.

64
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,458
I showed you this table on the second week
of this course.

65
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,626
This is the descriptive table, the table
one,

66
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:45,022
just on the men, from this particular
study.

67
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:52,940
The researchers divided the men up into
five quintiles of red meat intake.

68
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,485
So Q1 are the men who are eating the
lowest amount of red meat.

69
00:03:56,485 --> 00:04:01,540
Q5 is the men who, were eating the highest
amount of red meat.

70
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,600
And this table just shows you,
descriptively,

71
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,291
what are the characteristics of the men in
those five quintiles.

72
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:12,210
If study this table carefully and we look
at it in some detail again in week two of

73
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:17,300
this course, what you'll see is that all
the sort of bad risk factors for

74
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,870
health go up as you go up the red meat
intake quintiles.

75
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,463
For example, if you look at BMI.

76
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:28,237
In Q1, the BMI, the average BMI is 25.9.

77
00:04:28,237 --> 00:04:36,229
It Q2 it's 26.7, in Q3, it's 27.1, in Q4,
it's 27.6, in Q5, it's 28.3.

78
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:40,669
So as you go up across those quintiles,
BMI goes up.

79
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:44,870
Smoking also goes up as you go across the
quintiles.

80
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,511
Education and physical activity go down.

81
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:50,170
Fruit and vegetable intake go down.

82
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,300
Calories go up.

83
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,660
Again, all the kinds of things that are
not great for

84
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,640
our health tend to be more common in
people who eat a lot of red meat.

85
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,320
People who eat a lot of red meat just have
a lot of risky health behaviors.

86
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,450
The problem is, this is an observational
study.

87
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,720
These risk factors cluster.

88
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,230
So how do we isolate the effect of red
meat

89
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,020
eating from all of these other variables
that cluster with red meat eating?

90
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,210
That's what we're going to try to do with
regression analysis.

91
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,520
That's what regression analysis is set up
to try to do, is trying to isolate

92
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,410
the effect of one variable independent of
all these other things that go.

93
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,269
All these other confounders that go with
it.

94
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,230
And indeed, that's what the authors did in
this study.

95
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,190
As I said they did find that red meat
eating was

96
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,765
linked to an increase risk of death from
heart disease and cancer.

97
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:48,820
But, it might surprise you to learn that
they also found that

98
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:54,458
red meat eating was linked to an increased
risk of death from injuries and accidents.

99
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:58,381
That's things like car accidents and
firearm deaths.

100
00:05:58,381 --> 00:06:02,750
You might wonder, how is it that eating
red meat would increase your

101
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,790
risk of dying in a car accident?

102
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,560
It doesn't seem like there'd be a causal
link there, yet that's, they can show,

103
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,810
in this study that, the, that red meat
eating is linked to this type of death,

104
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,650
as well as heart disease and cancer.

105
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:22,930
This is going to get into the issue of how
good can we really adjust from,

106
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,540
for confounding.

107
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,310
How good can we really isolate one.

108
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,730
Risk factor from a cluster of risk
factors.

109
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,660
We'll get to this particular example
towards the end of this week and

110
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,566
I'll give you sort of of a punch line on
that one.
