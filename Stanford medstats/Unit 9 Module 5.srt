1
00:00:07,988 --> 00:00:11,233
In this next module, I'm going to give an
introduction to Cox regression,

2
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:14,038
which is the multivariate regression
technique that you use

3
00:00:14,038 --> 00:00:17,432
when you have a time-to-event outcome.

4
00:00:17,432 --> 00:00:21,300
Very similar to the other types of
regression that we talked about.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,480
But is a bit of a more sophisticated
model, so

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,260
this will just serve as an introduction to
the topic.

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,340
To give you the basics of the model, and
hopefully entice you to

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,230
take a more advanced course if you want to
hear more about this topic.

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,690
So where are we on our little statistical
chart of tests here.

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,200
We're talking about when we have an
outcome variable that's a time to

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,320
event variable.

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,160
So when we're doing survival analysis.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,810
And I mentioned in the second week of the
course we talked about rate ratios which

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,000
were just ratios of incident rates.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,670
So, just comparing two groups very simply
we would use a rate ratio.

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,484
If we want to do survival curves,

17
00:00:57,484 --> 00:01:02,335
we talked about in the seventh week of the
course, Kaplan-Meier statistics.

18
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:08,100
And the material we're talking about today
is actually very related to Kaplan-Meier.

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,990
A lot of times in the literature what
you'll see is that,

20
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,660
in an analysis where you're doing,

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,806
you got a time-to-event outcome, a cohort
study, or a randomized trial.

22
00:01:16,806 --> 00:01:19,790
There'll be a Kaplan-Meier curve, a nice
picture there, and

23
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,160
then you'll see a Cox regression.

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,890
Those are often tied together in the
literature.

25
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,250
The limitation of Kaplan-Meier of course
is that you can only use it for

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,190
comparing different groups.

27
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,260
It doesn't work for continuous predictors
unless you chop them up.

28
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,535
It also doesn't, you are not able to
adjust for

29
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:39,200
confounders and things like that.

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,330
So of course we want some kind of
regression technique for

31
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,760
time to event outcomes.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,350
And that's where the Cox Regression comes
in.

33
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,950
It's the multivariate regression technique
for this type of outcome variable.

34
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,880
And of course regression allows you to do
all the things we've talked about.

35
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,640
You can have multiple predictors to
improve prediction in the model.

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,730
You can adjust for confounding, you can
test for

37
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,480
interaction, all those kinds of things.

38
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,390
So, Cox Regression is

39
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,920
sometimes also called the Proportional
Hazards Regression.

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,370
Because one of the key assumptions of this
model is something called the proportional

41
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,190
hazard assumption.

42
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,650
So I'll talk briefly about that.

43
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,770
It's the multivariate regression technique
for time-to-event outcomes.

44
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,840
When we have time-to-event outcomes
remember when we talked about

45
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,210
the Kaplan-Meier curves, one of the key
things is that.

46
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,340
These outcomes take into account
censoring,

47
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,720
we're following people over time and we're
able to say when people drop out of

48
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,270
the study even if they haven't yet had an
event.

49
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,610
So all of this, these methods take into
account that sensory.

50
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,770
Same, all the things we talked about for
Kaplanâ€“Meier apply here.

51
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,050
What do you get out of Cox regression?

52
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,760
We actually alluded to this in the second
week of the course when we

53
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,530
were talking about relative risks, because
what you get out at the end of

54
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,540
the day from a Cox regression model, are
hazard ratios.

55
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,550
A hazard ratio is just yet another type of
relative risk.

56
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:07,530
It's very, very similar to a rate ratio
except it's a ratio of two hazard rates.

57
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,910
And a hazard rate is an instantaneous
incidents rate,

58
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,006
I'll talk about that in this module.

59
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:18,920
Because we're doing regression often what
comes out is in the adjusted hazard ratio,

60
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,880
it's been adjusted for other things in the
model.

61
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,760
Again I mentioned this briefly,

62
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,020
in the second week of the course just
recall that I talked a little bit

63
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,055
about hazard ratios In the context of the
concept of relative risk.

64
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:33,460
It's yet another measure of relative risk.

65
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,850
And it has a similar interpretation as
just a regular old basic rate ratio.

66
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,640
It's the ratio of instantaneous incidence
rates, however.

67
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,780
So it's just slightly different from a
rate ratio.

68
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,120
It has to be calculated from regression.

69
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,400
You're not going to be able to calculate
it by hand.

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,820
Since it comes from a regression, it's
again, usually multivariable-adjusted.

71
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,240
And I had presented this little example in
the second week of the course,

72
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,080
just to show you how to interpret a hazard
ratio.

73
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,220
They're actually straight forward to
interpret.

74
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,550
This table,

75
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,810
the hazard ratios in this table actually
came out a Cox regression model.

76
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,050
So just to review, this particular
example,

77
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,710
this was a randomized study comparing a
drug, ranolazine, to a placebo.

78
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,390
The primary end point that they were
looking at in

79
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,990
this study was a composite end point.

80
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,640
They were looking for either death,
myocardial infarction,

81
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,030
that's a heart attack, or recurrent
ischemia.

82
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,780
That's the primary end point.

83
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,592
The hazard ratio here turned out to be
0.92.

84
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:32,770
You can see that right here.

85
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,310
So, how do I interpret that hazard ratio?

86
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,130
Again, it's very similar to interpreting
any type of relative risk.

87
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:48,210
That is an 8% reduction in the mortality
and MI and recurrent ischemia.

88
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,450
This, again, primary end point.

89
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,440
The rate of this primary outcome in the
drug group

90
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,030
compared with the placebo group.

91
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,590
Now it's not statistically significant.

92
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,470
You can see that the confident interval
ranges from 0.83 to 1.02 so

93
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,440
it does, it does cross the null value of
1.4.

94
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,780
And the P value is 0.11.

95
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,250
So it's not statistically significant.

96
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,379
It's not a big, of a big magnitude either.

97
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:13,740
But that's the basic interpretation and

98
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,622
that hazard ratio came out of a Cox
regression.

99
00:05:16,622 --> 00:05:23,050
By way of introduction, I'm going to show
you two more examples from the literature.

100
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,410
Just to show you how these things tend to
be presented in the literature, and

101
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,540
to motivate the Cox regression model for
you.

102
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,560
Here's an example from the literature that
was a study of publication bias.

103
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,069
And you can see as I mentioned,

104
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:40,850
usually a Cox regression is linked up with
the Kaplan-Meier curve, so

105
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,900
this study in their report, they start
with a nice Kaplan-Meier curve.

106
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,100
You can figure out a lot of the,

107
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,910
the results of this study just by looking
at the Kaplan-Meier curve here.

108
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,340
So what this study was, is kind of a cool
study, because they were looking at,

109
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,180
again, this problem of publication bias.

110
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,760
So they took a bunch of studies at the
time that they were funded.

111
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,240
So the baseline point here is when the
grants were approved and

112
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,670
these studies were funded, and

113
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:14,615
the event here is publication of the main
findings of this study.

114
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:19,130
So they actually track to, to see from the
time of funding,

115
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,420
until, you know, how long did it take
until the major publication, you know,

116
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:29,070
reporting the major finding of the, of
those studies, was released.

117
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,330
And so publication is a good thing, of
course, so the outcome here is, you know,

118
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,190
it's not the [INAUDIBLE] is a nice, it's a
good thing, it's publication.

119
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,420
And they wanted to know if the result at
the end of the day from

120
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,850
a study was something was that ended up
being statistically significant.

121
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,540
That they proved, you know, the hypothesis
they were after.

122
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,870
Would those studies be published more
quickly than studies that

123
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,600
had a null finding, than studies that
didn't find what they were after, and

124
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
indeed that's exactly what they found.

125
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,200
This is getting at the problem of
publication bias,

126
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,080
because what happens in the medical
literature is that people rush to

127
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,070
publish things when they find a
significant result.

128
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,070
But null findings, which are often just as
important,

129
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,600
may have a delay in publication or never
be published at all.

130
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,374
So you can see with just looking at the
Kaplan-Meier curve here.

131
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:20,330
You of course, you started 100%, this
means 100% were unpublished, and

132
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,520
then every time there's a dip in this
curve, that represents a publication.

133
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,580
And this dark line are all the studies
that found significant results at

134
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,250
the end of the day.

135
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,300
So you can see that that curve is dropping
off much more quickly.

136
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,560
So the rate of publication was much faster
for

137
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,730
the studies that ended up finding
something significant.

138
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,830
Now for the Null studies, that's this gray
line here,

139
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,230
you can see that there was definitely a
delay In the publication.

140
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,770
The rate of publication was slower for
cities that found a null result.

141
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,510
So this is kind of what the authors
expected.

142
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,240
Yeah, and that's indeed what they found.

143
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,940
What was interesting, though,

144
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,990
was that they actually ended up defining a
third group here.

145
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:05,040
Now it's small group, but this kind of
medium shaded line is a small group.

146
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,070
And what this group was is these were
studies that ended up

147
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,720
with what's called a non-significant trend
at the end of the day.

148
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,580
So this is a kind of thing where you come
out with a P value of like, 0.08, or

149
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,250
0.09, or 0.06.

150
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,540
It's not quite statistically significant,
and

151
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,530
it turns out that it looks like people
aren't quite sure what to do with that.

152
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,990
Reviewers, editors, even

153
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,453
authors themselves may not be quite sure
how to report those results.

154
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:36,025
And so those actually ended up taking the
longest to get published interesting,

155
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:37,590
interestingly enough.

156
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,590
That's kind of similar to the HIV vaccine
trial in that there was no delayed in

157
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,660
publication on that one.

158
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,100
But this is, you know, some of the p
values are not quite significant so

159
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,020
there's some controversy about what to do
with those.

160
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,560
Anyway, this is the Kaplan-Meier curve.

161
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,030
There's a lot of information in the
Kaplan-Meier curve.

162
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,280
The p value from the Log-Rank test did
come out to

163
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,890
be statistically significant here.

164
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,590
Telling us that at least one of those
groups is differed in the rate

165
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,290
of publication.

166
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,150
But the p value from a Log-Rank test
doesn't quantify the magnitude of

167
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,000
the effect.

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,660
So one of the reasons to do a Cox
regression, and get a hazard ratio, is so

169
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,310
that we can quantify, what is the size of
the effect here?

170
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,650
So they went ahead and ran a Cox
regression.

171
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,855
And I'm just going to show you the
results.

172
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:22,010
Again, I'll get into the details of the
Cox regression in a few minutes.

173
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,200
But just to show you the results here,

174
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,090
this is a very simple Cox regression
model.

175
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,080
So, all they had in the model, I'm just
going to write out the model.

176
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,130
What we're actually modeling in a Cox
regression is the natural log of

177
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:34,930
the hazard rate.

178
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,440
That's our outcome, don't worry about that
yet.

179
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,010
But we're modeling a regression model, and

180
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,330
what's in this regression model, there's
only one categorical predictor.

181
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,840
So they have a categorical predictor,
you're either in the null group,

182
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,760
the non-significant trend group, or the
significant group.

183
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,410
And they dummy coded that, so just to
review dummy coding here,

184
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,760
there was a beta in the model for a
non-significant trend group, and

185
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,560
there was a beta in the model for this
significant group.

186
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,030
And the null group is the reference group
so

187
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,285
there's no parameter in the model for
them.

188
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:10,180
And here's the result.

189
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,490
So you can see that the null group, again,
is the reference group.

190
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,880
So their hazard ratio is, by default, set
to 1.00.

191
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,310
What they found was that, indeed.

192
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,300
For the people, the groups that ended up
with a statistically signifigant result at

193
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,970
the end of the day.

194
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,770
They had a, more than a two fold increase
in the rate,

195
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,710
the incidence of publication, compared
with the null group.

196
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,670
So there is a doubling or more than a
doubling in the rate of

197
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,525
publication when you have significant
results compared with null.

198
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:42,760
That's how you would interpret that hazard
ratio.

199
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,870
They also calculated a hazard ratio for
the non-significant trend, and that

200
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,840
one came out to be 0.39, and that would
say that there was a delay, a slowing in

201
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,190
the rate of publication in that group as
we saw in the Kaplanâ€“Meier chart.

202
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,770
What's kind of fun here is that the
confidence interval cross is one, so

203
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,290
this is not statistically significant.

204
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,530
But it kind of just barely crosses one.

205
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,680
So this, itself,

206
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,100
might be what we would call a non
significant trend towards ineffect.

207
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,010
So you know, it's sort of ironic that the
non-significant trend group showed

208
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,850
a non-significant trend.

209
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,110
Anyway, that's a use a Cox regression to
quantify the size of the effect.

210
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,740
Here's another fun example from the
literature.

211
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,680
So there were a series of studies that
looked at this idea of, you know?

212
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,820
When people get nominated for something.

213
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,490
They say, oh, it was an honor just to be
nominated.

214
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,330
They were trying to, the authors here were
trying to kind of look at that question.

215
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,720
So they were looking at Academy Award
winners.

216
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,880
And they actually started with actors and
actresses.

217
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,670
And they said, let's compare the longevity
of actors and

218
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,470
actresses who actually won a, an Academy
Award.

219
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,880
Let's compare that to actors and

220
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,950
actresses who were nominated for an
Academy Award but never one.

221
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,470
And interestingly, they found a survival
advantage For the actors and

222
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,210
actresses who actually won the Academy
Award.

223
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,225
I'm not showing you those results here.

224
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:08,760
What I'm showing you here is the
Kaplan-Meier curve from

225
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,700
a related study that they did.

226
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,700
Where the same kind of idea, except that
they looked at Academy Award winners.

227
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,630
For screenwriting rather than acting.

228
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,870
And so interestingly, they found the
opposite thing here.

229
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,960
I find this of interest,

230
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,770
because my other hat that I wear at
Stanford is I do a lot of writing.

231
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,120
The red line are those who were nominated
but never won and

232
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,760
the blue line are the winners, so take a
quick look at that Kaplan-Meier curve.

233
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,470
What you see is we're looking at survival
here, so in fact,

234
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,370
the winners did worse than the nominees
only in screen writing.

235
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,840
It was the opposite of what they found
with actors and actresses.

236
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,920
So, maybe for actors and actresses, you
get some boost in longevity if you

237
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,520
win because you get more visibility, more
money.

238
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,710
But the same is not true of screenwriters.

239
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:59,460
The P-value from the log rank test here
comes out to be statistically significant,

240
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,880
saying that those curves really are
different.

241
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,660
Of course, this is just an unadjusted
curve.

242
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,178
And we would like to do a Cox regression
to quantify the effect and to adjust for

243
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:11,830
potential confounders.

244
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,730
One other thing I just want to point out
in this analysis.

245
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,010
Notice that the Kaplan-Meier curve the
time scale is actually not in time,

246
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,950
but is in age.

247
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,310
So usually so far we've been talking about
the time scale for

248
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,308
time to event outcomes being just the
amount of time that you spend in a study.

249
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,900
But if you're doing a long term cohort
study.

250
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,930
This is a retrospective core study but,
retrospective or

251
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,740
prospective, you're following people for a
long amount of time.

252
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,700
Often it makes more sense to use age as
the timescale and

253
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,430
what you're essentially doing is lining
people up by ages.

254
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,380
So you're comparing 70-year-olds to
70-year-olds, for example.

255
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,590
And you can do that very easily in
survival analysis is to treat age as

256
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,630
the type, so just point out that they're
doing that here.

257
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,450
So they went on and did a Cox regression.

258
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,580
Now they were, this was based on internet
research.

259
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,782
So they didn't go out and actually collect
data ques, you know,

260
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:06,050
questionnaire's on people, so

261
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,670
they could only find limited information
about these people on the internet.

262
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,110
But they tried to adjust for

263
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,860
basic confounders that they could find on
the internet.

264
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,760
So what you're looking at here is first of
all,

265
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,260
the very first row here, that's the hazard
ratio from the basic analysis.

266
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,410
So un-adjusted.

267
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,440
So that corresponds kind of directly to
the Kaplan-Meier curve.

268
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,120
So the winners compared with the nominees,
have a 37% higher rate of death,

269
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:38,000
the higher mortality rate here, and it is
statistically significant.

270
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,670
Then they went on and tried to adjust for

271
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,880
all of these different confounders that
you see listed here.

272
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,705
And you can see that as they adjust for

273
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:47,560
confounders, the hazard ratio really
doesn't budge much.

274
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,950
And they finally at the end adjust for all
the potential confounders at once.

275
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,090
The hazard ratio there is 1.35.

276
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,690
So basically there was no change in the
hazard ratio, at least adjusting for

277
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,720
these confounders.

278
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,806
The ones that they had.

279
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:04,320
We couldn't explain away the effect by
confounding.

280
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,680
And there maybe unmeasured confounders
that they were unable to adjust for here.

281
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,280
There also have been some legitimate
concerns brought up

282
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,700
about these particular analyses.

283
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,470
I'm not going to go into these, those in,
in this course.

284
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,700
I'm just going to leave it as a kind of a
fun example of Cox regression

285
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,910
and Kaplan-Meier.

286
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,490
Alright.

287
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,940
Now, let's dive into the nitty-gritty
details of the Cox regression model.

288
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,000
So just to review, we talked last week
about linear regression, so

289
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,115
let me draw the linear regression picture
now.

290
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:38,550
The linear regression,

291
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,330
we were trying to say something about the
relationship of a predictor x.

292
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,960
That could be a binary, categorical, or
continuous predictor.

293
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,630
Here I'm showing a continuous predictor.

294
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,860
We were trying to say that the
relationship between that predictor and

295
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,160
some outcome variable y.

296
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,190
In a linear regression we were just
directly modeling y itself.

297
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,630
We were fitting a line to a scatter plot
like this.

298
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,900
So our model was just that y.

299
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,080
Can be predicted as alpha plus beta x as
the equation of a line.

300
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,060
And of course, we could put more than 1
beta x in the model.

301
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,890
But this is a very simple picture of
linear regression.

302
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,520
We have an intercept, we have a slope, so

303
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,440
we fit a line directly to these data, that
was linear regression.

304
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,020
Logistic regression which I told,

305
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,240
told you about earlier this week was
actually very similar.

306
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,710
Because if you look at the right hand side
of the equation it's,

307
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,860
it's exactly the same.

308
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,400
We have an alpha plus beta x and

309
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,760
we're taking some predictor x, whether it
be binary, categorical or continuous.

310
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,960
And again I'm going to draw the picture
where its continuous, and

311
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,280
we're trying to fit a line to some outcome
variable.

312
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,800
Now, the complication here,

313
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,280
is that the outcome variable from logistic
regression is a binary predictor.

314
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,580
And we're not going to model directly to
the binary predictor.

315
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,592
We're going to a little transformation of
the binary predictor.

316
00:16:57,592 --> 00:17:01,730
We're going to model the outcome here as
the logit of our binary outcome,

317
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,450
that's the log odds of getting the
outcome.

318
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:11,939
So, we fit a line to logit in logistic
regression for binary outcomes.

319
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,618
But it's still fitting a line.

320
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:17,958
Same basic idea, the beta by the way from
logistic regression as I've told you.

321
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:22,230
If you exponentiate that, that just gave
you the odds ratio.

322
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,725
So, what we got out at the end of the day
was an odds ratio.

323
00:17:24,725 --> 00:17:28,440
But the regression pictures look pretty
similar and

324
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,620
then let's add to that now Cox regression.

325
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,490
So Cox regression not surprisingly looks
kind of similar,

326
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,400
the right hand side of the regression
equation.

327
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,030
Looks pretty much like linear regression,
logisitic regression.

328
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,900
And again you can add more beta's and more
x's if you do multivariable.

329
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,696
So the only question then for

330
00:17:46,696 --> 00:17:50,860
Cox regression is what goes on the
left-hand side of that equation.

331
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,370
so, what are, what's the outcome variable
that we're actually modeling and

332
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,870
fitting a line to for Cox Regression.

333
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,388
So, again, we have some predictor x, what
are we trying to link it to.

334
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:04,300
So what we are trying to link it to for
Cox regression is actually.

335
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,641
The a, something called a hazard rate.

336
00:18:06,641 --> 00:18:12,057
So I'm going to tell you in more detail
what a hazard rate is in a minute.

337
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,690
But a hazard rate is basically your
instantaneous incidence rate.

338
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,970
So it's just the rate at which events are
occurring.

339
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:22,070
Now, technically, we're actually the
outcome variable here

340
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,600
is the natural log of the hazard rate.

341
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,390
So just as with logistic regression, which
ended up involving a natural log,

342
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,360
we add a little natural log because of

343
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,135
the hazard rate itself can only go from 0
to positive infinity.

344
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:42,130
We would like y to range from negative
infinity to positive infinity.

345
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,560
So by dropping on a natural log there, we
then the hazard that can

346
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,900
go that quantity can go from negative to
positive infinity.

347
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,550
So it's just for

348
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,900
mathematical reasons that we end up
actually modeling the log hazard rate.

349
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,740
The log has nice mathematical properties.

350
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,290
Again, while we're just fitting a line.

351
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,940
We're linking.

352
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:05,156
We're seeing whether or not x can predict
the log hazard rate.

353
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:06,280
Okay.

354
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:12,205
So, notice that Cox regression looks a lot
like all the other regression techniques.

355
00:19:12,205 --> 00:19:17,040
All the kinds of things we've talked about
are going to apply here.

356
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,670
So first of all, it has to be linear.

357
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:23,600
In terms of, you know, if you have a
continuous predictor it

358
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,610
has to have a linear relationship with the
natural log of hazard rate.

359
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,230
That's a little difficult to test and I'm
not going to get into that in this module,

360
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,480
but just kind of keep that in the back of
your mind.

361
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,390
The, If you want to put a categorical
variable,

362
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,910
you're going to be doing dummy coding.

363
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,210
Sort of, you can put interactions in, in
the same way that we talked about.

364
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,450
Everything else is kind of the same.

365
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,550
The beta for, for Cox regression is
going to end up,

366
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,780
as I mentioned, translating into a hazard
ratio.

367
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:56,350
So it's actually, if you exponentiate the
beta from a Cox regression,

368
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,880
you end up with a hazard ratio.

369
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,920
Let me just say briefly what a hazard rate
is.

370
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,850
So, what is a hazard rate?

371
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,620
Hazard rate is just,

372
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,090
again, the instantaneous rate at which
events are occurring.

373
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,167
The hazard rate, notice that when I wrote,
write down the hazard rate,

374
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:18,570
I'm always writing this h and then in
parentheses, t.

375
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,610
That, what I'm saying there, what I mean
by that mathematical symbol

376
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:26,690
is that the hazard rate is a function of
time.

377
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:31,850
So, this is where the Cox regression model
gets a little more sophisticated than the,

378
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,520
the other models we've talked about so
far.

379
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,070
We are following people over time when we
have a time to event outcome.

380
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:43,870
And so the hazard rate itself, what we're
modeling here is, it's a something that's

381
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,080
allowed to change over time, potentially,
it could change over time.

382
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,560
So the rate at which events occur don't
have to be constant.

383
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,470
They could be constant, so

384
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,540
your hazard rate could be totally constant
over time, but it doesn't have to be.

385
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,580
You could have a very complicated hazard
rate function, like you're, your.

386
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,250
Event rates could be doing something like
that.

387
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,560
So that's actually what we're modeling in
a Cox regression model.

388
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,770
It's this instantaneous hazard rate which
is a ilttle complicated because it's

389
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,615
allowed to change over time.

390
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:14,280
At the end of the day, though, you're
going to see in a minute that we,

391
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,340
end up, because it's hard to model that.

392
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,520
It could be a very complicated function.

393
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,790
We actually end up deciding to avoid
modeling the hazard rate itself,

394
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,640
the absolute value.

395
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,250
What we end up doing instead, in Cox
regression, is the following.

396
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,400
We just say, well, all we really want to
do at the end of the day is compare

397
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,910
different risk factors, compare different
groups.

398
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,770
So as long as the basic hazard rate
function is the same between two groups,

399
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,910
so let's say we have smokers and we want
to

400
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,117
compare them to non-smokers on the rate
of, say, the development of lung cancer.

401
00:21:47,117 --> 00:21:49,180
Something like that.

402
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,880
Or hypertension, or whatever the outcome
might be.

403
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,470
If we were actually able to measure the
hazard rate at every instant maybe we

404
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,410
could plot it and it looks like that, that
top curve for

405
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,490
smokers, that bottom curve for non
smokers.

406
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,240
Well that's pretty hard to estimate.

407
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,480
Right?
This might be some complicated curve and,

408
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,160
and specifying that curve exactly is
going to be hard.

409
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,680
So what we do instead in Cox Regression is
we just say,

410
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,340
well you know what I don't really care too
much what that underlying curve is,

411
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,140
whatever its complicated function might
be.

412
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,360
What I care about is the difference in the
hazard rate between

413
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,390
smokers and nonsmokers.

414
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:24,200
So, what we end up modeling instead, is
just that the difference in those curves.

415
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,250
And then, one assumption, what we're
going to make.

416
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,080
Is that we're going to assume that that
difference in the relative difference in

417
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,480
those two curves, is constant over time.

418
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,430
That's what's called the proportional
hazards assumption.

419
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:39,110
So no matter what that underlying hazard
rate function is, we're going to

420
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,530
assume that the difference between smokers
and non-smokers does not change over time.

421
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,765
So that we can estimate a single hazard
ratio that

422
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:51,350
represents the relative risk for smokers
versus non-smokers.

423
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,210
So that's what we're going to do at the
end of the day.

424
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,390
And that gets rid of having, us having to
deal with the very complicated function of

425
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:02,410
the actual hazard rate itself.

426
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,510
In mathematical terms, just to tell you
very specifically what

427
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,840
the hazard function is, you can specify
this a the limit here.

428
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,280
I'll leave that for those of you who like
that kind of thing.

429
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,410
But in words, the hazard function is just
the probability that if you

430
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,780
make it up until this instant T, that
you're going to succumb to the event,

431
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,790
whatever it is, in the next instant.

432
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,414
So literally, it's the instantaneous
incident rate.

433
00:23:23,414 --> 00:23:26,390
It's the instantaneous rate at which
events are occurring.

434
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,670
And because it's instantaneous, again,
it's allowed to change over time.

435
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,760
It could completely change over time.

436
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,040
So, the Cox regression model has, looks
like the following.

437
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,540
Again, we're modeling the natural log of
this hazard rate that's allowed to

438
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,320
change over time.

439
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,600
And again, the little key here just means
that this function.

440
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,440
This is a complicated outcome, 'cuz it's
allowed to change over time.

441
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,220
We're modeling that as some intercept,
which I'm representing here as.

442
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,850
The, the as a base line hazard rate.

443
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,480
So this is a,

444
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,610
kind of just like, for every, for, if you
had a 0 for all the x's in the model.

445
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,460
This would considered to be the starting
point for the hazard rate.

446
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,100
And what we're assuming again, is that
everybody sort of has the.

447
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,140
The same underlying shape here.

448
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,110
And we're actually not going to try to
estimate this.

449
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,291
It's in the model implicitly, but we're
going to avoid estimating it.

450
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:19,301
And, then, we have this linear function of
betas and

451
00:24:19,301 --> 00:24:23,940
x's, same as we did with logistic and, and
linear regression.

452
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,980
So again, we're going to take, we'll allow
this hazard rate function to take on

453
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,570
any form, just avoid estimating it which
is a great thing.

454
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,320
We going to estimate these betas?

455
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,200
The betas have a direct translation.

456
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,160
If you exponentiate these betas they are
hazard ratios so that's kind of nice.

457
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,890
So, what we're getting out of the model is
something simple at the end of the day.

458
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,996
Even though what's going on underneath
might be kind of complicated.

459
00:24:46,996 --> 00:24:51,272
Let me just show you how it is that those
betas have

460
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:54,609
a translations as a as a hazard ratio.

461
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:57,510
It's sort of similar when I showed you
that the betas from

462
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,180
logistic regression have a translation as
an odds ratio.

463
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,380
Where does that come from?

464
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,370
How do we arrive there?

465
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,600
So let me just show you that.

466
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,010
I'm going to start with a binary
predictor.

467
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,290
So let's start with, let's say we're doing
a Cox regression, and

468
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,200
the model that we run, again, the outcome
is this natural log and

469
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,210
it has a ratio there's some intercepts.

470
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,100
The natural log of the baseline hazard
function that we're

471
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,460
actually going to kind of avoid estimating
but

472
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,690
I'll just, I'll write it in there for now
to show you that it's going to cancel out.

473
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,580
And let's say that we're modeling say lung
cancer, and

474
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,040
we have two predictors in the model.

475
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,550
I'm going to have a beta for smoking.

476
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,540
And I'll make that a binary variable,
smoker or not smoker.

477
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,590
And I'm going to have a beta for age and
that's going to be a continuous predictor.

478
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:42,340
So I have those two predictors in the
model.

479
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,760
Well, what is a hazard ratio?

480
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,380
A hazard ratio is a ratio of two hazard
rates.

481
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:51,480
So, the hazard rate for one type of person
divided by the hazard rate for

482
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,180
another type of person.

483
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,720
So say I want to get the hazard ratio for
smoking versus non smoking.

484
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,640
Smokers versus non smokers.

485
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,990
I want to get the hazard ratio for lung
cancer, which is our outcome here.

486
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,970
If I fit this Cox regression model, I'll
get out a beta for smoking and

487
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,840
a beta for age.

488
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,108
So if I then wanted to get to the fact
that is a hazard ratio here,

489
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:18,252
I can exponentiate both sides of the model
to get rid of this natural log.

490
00:26:18,252 --> 00:26:19,800
So that's what I'm doing here.

491
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,220
Get rid of the natural logs, and we see
that the hazard rate for

492
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,650
a smoker is going to be this base line
hazard function right here.

493
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,970
And then e raised to beta smoking,
whatever value that turns out to,

494
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,430
to have in the model plus beta age.

495
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,145
And then I'm just going to, I'm going to
pick an age here.

496
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:39,281
So I, I don't care.

497
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:42,050
I don't want to get the hazard ratio for
age yet.

498
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,170
So I'm just going to say that I want to
compare a 60 year old in

499
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,440
the numerator to a 60 year old in the
denominator.

500
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,569
I could pick any age here, as long as I'm
holding that constant.

501
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:52,540
That's what statistical adjustment means.

502
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,670
It means that I'm holding that covariant
age constant.

503
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,532
Then I'm going to in the denominator.

504
00:26:59,532 --> 00:27:03,852
I'm going to have a nonsmoker of the same
age, and what you can show is this is

505
00:27:03,852 --> 00:27:07,380
according to my Cox regression model, this
is the hazard for

506
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,040
a nonsmoker in the denominator, a hazard
for a smoker in the numerator.

507
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,470
The baseline hazards will cancel.

508
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,500
The betas for age will also cancel because
I'm holding those fixed.

509
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,856
So we're left with that the hazard ratio
for, for

510
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:24,160
smokers is just the whatever the beta for
smoking is exponentiated.

511
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,440
So that turns out to be the hazard ratio
for smoking adjusted for age.

512
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:35,200
For a continuous predictor for age, it's
the same logic.

513
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,110
So now the only thing is that I would hold
smoking fix.

514
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,660
So the smoking variable's going to cancel.

515
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,100
I can have two nonsmokers or two smokers.

516
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,680
Again, the baseline hazard we're going to
assume is the same for everybody.

517
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,685
And then I can put an older person in the
numerator,

518
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:51,010
compared to a younger person in the
denominator.

519
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,399
Here I'm looking at a ten unit jump in
age.

520
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:57,095
If I multiply the beta for age by ten and
then exponentiate.

521
00:27:57,095 --> 00:28:00,483
That will give me the hazard ratio for
lung cancer for

522
00:28:00,483 --> 00:28:02,665
a ten-unit increase in age.

523
00:28:02,665 --> 00:28:07,080
Very similar to the logic we went through,
in getting a,

524
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,590
an odds ratio, an adjusted odds ratio, out
of logistic regression.

525
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,980
Now, when you do this all in the computer,

526
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,450
the computer is going to even do the
exponentiation for you and

527
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,040
it's going to give you out that hazard
ratio.

528
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,610
You're not going to have to think through
that.

529
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,018
But I just want to show you,

530
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:25,078
mathematically, how it is that, that beta
translates to a hazard ratio.

531
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,414
As I mentioned, we have this proportional
hazards assumption.

532
00:28:28,414 --> 00:28:31,276
So whenever you do Cox regression, a very
important thing to do is

533
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:34,847
actually to test the proportional hazards
assumption.

534
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,998
And it's just easiest to show this with a
picture again.

535
00:28:37,998 --> 00:28:43,192
So imagine that the hazard rate as a
function of time differs for

536
00:28:43,192 --> 00:28:46,805
smokers and nonsmokers.

537
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:50,149
And I'm just making this function up
completely, but

538
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:54,502
let's say here's non-smokers and here's
smokers.

539
00:28:54,502 --> 00:28:57,463
The proportional hazards assumption says
that it doesn't matter what that

540
00:28:57,463 --> 00:29:00,076
underlying shape of the hazard function
is.

541
00:29:00,076 --> 00:29:02,722
But what we need is that the difference
between smokers and

542
00:29:02,722 --> 00:29:05,439
non-smokers always has to be this same.

543
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:08,539
And that's because at the end of the day,
we report a single hazard ratio for

544
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:12,835
smoking, and that, the assumption is that
that's constant over time.

545
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,309
So we have to test that assumption.

546
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:21,403
It turns out to be not easy to directly
plot the hazard rate itself.

547
00:29:21,403 --> 00:29:24,175
We'll, we do something else called a log
log plot, and

548
00:29:24,175 --> 00:29:27,640
the, if the log plot, if the lines are
parallel in a log log plot,

549
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:33,477
that would imply that the proportional
hazards assumption is met.

550
00:29:33,477 --> 00:29:34,327
If the lines are not parallel,

551
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:36,806
that implies that the proportional hazard
assumptions is not met.

552
00:29:36,806 --> 00:29:39,906
And this is just one of many ways that we
can test proportional hazards.

553
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:42,714
Again, this module is really meant to
serve as an introduction to

554
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,155
Cox regression.

555
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:45,550
So let me just show you a log-log plot,

556
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,066
because it's probably the simplest way to
test for proportional hazards.

557
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:53,890
So here is a log-log plot where you can
see that the lines are kind of crossing in

558
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,299
the two groups.

559
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:58,939
This is a, you know, a treatment versus a
placebo group here, or, or

560
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:00,874
two different treatments.

561
00:30:00,874 --> 00:30:04,136
And you can see that the orange line and
green lines kind of cross.

562
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,888
So this was an example from a study where
we did not meet proportional hazards for

563
00:30:07,888 --> 00:30:12,635
this predictor treatment, versus, one
treatment versus another.

564
00:30:12,635 --> 00:30:16,443
Because the lines seem to cross, so they
don't seem to be truly parallel lines.

565
00:30:16,443 --> 00:30:21,110
I'll show you an example in a minute where
we do seem to meet proportional hazards.

566
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,555
And, it's not only by looking at this plot
that I know that I have some other test

567
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:27,682
proportional hazards that I can look at to
kind of back up my intuition on

568
00:30:27,682 --> 00:30:30,804
just looking at this plot.

569
00:30:30,804 --> 00:30:34,757
I want to just end here with an example
that I showed showed you when we

570
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:36,834
did the unit on Kaplan-Meyer curves,

571
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:42,501
we showed you an example looking at
patterns with hepatitis.

572
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:46,644
Some were given a steroid and some were
given a control.

573
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,344
The control group is in red and

574
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:53,475
they died off much faster than he people
who were given the steroid.

575
00:30:53,475 --> 00:30:55,440
So, clearly, the steroid was quite
effective here,

576
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,590
as we saw, the Kaplan-Meyer statistic, the
log range statistic here,

577
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,210
was significant, and those curve
definitely look different.

578
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,700
So what I'm going to add to that Kaplan
Meyer now.

579
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,730
As I'm going to show you the Cox
regression results from just that simple

580
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,550
analysis comparing the two groups.

581
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:14,840
And again, we could when we do Cox
regression also adjust for other things.

582
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,860
But I just want to show you some simple
output from a computer for

583
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,110
from Cox regression.

584
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:25,730
So when I run those data in my computer in
a Cox regression I get a model out.

585
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:29,500
Now notice, very interesting here, think
about

586
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,780
the difference between the output I showed
you from linear regression and

587
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,450
logistic regression, there is no intercept
here.

588
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,390
And that's the whole point, right?

589
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,690
With Cox Regression, we don't estimate
that intercept.

590
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,720
So you actually, in your output,

591
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,430
will not get an intercept, because your
not estimating.

592
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,140
But you do get a hazard ratio, and you get
a p value.

593
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,800
And so

594
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,430
when I compare treatment versus control in
this case, I get a significant p value.

595
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,960
The Log-Rank test was significant so

596
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,440
it makes sense that this p value would
also be significant.

597
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,440
And we also quantify the effect.

598
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,690
The hazard ratio is 0.43 indicating about
a 57% decrease

599
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,930
in the mortality rate for those on on the
drug, on the steroid here.

600
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,440
And then finally, if we're running a Cox
regression,

601
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,650
we would want to test proportional
hazards.

602
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:15,820
We can run very easily, most computer
programs will easily generate for

603
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,490
you the log-log plot, so I did generate
the log-log plot here.

604
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:24,340
So this is the, control group on the top,
the treatment group on the bottom here.

605
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,360
And, again, we're looking for parallel
lines.

606
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,612
Now, those lines are not perfectly
parallel, but they're pretty close to

607
00:32:31,612 --> 00:32:34,068
parallel, so I would probably look at that
log-log plot and say.

608
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:35,580
Well, they're, they're pretty close, so

609
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,730
I'm going to assume that proportional
hazards are met here.

610
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,310
And again there are many other tests that
we use to test proportional hazards, and

611
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,250
that's just one of them.

612
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,410
I just want to as introduce you to it as a
way of introduction.
