1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:06,510
Alright, so that's how we use multivariate
analysis to control for confounders.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:12,005
We put those confounders in the model, we
review, we see, we observe how those

3
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:16,140
confounders, of putting those confounders
in the model changes the slope,

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,470
the relationship between the predictor we
care about and the outcome variable.

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,882
Now I'm going to talk about another
function of multivariate analysis.

6
00:00:24,882 --> 00:00:26,600
Which is simply to improve predictions.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,450
Sometimes our goal is to be able to
predict what is it

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,930
that tells us who's going to like Obama or
who's going to do homework.

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,710
Whatever we are trying to predict.

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,230
Putting more variables in the model will
often improve predictions cause if you

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,220
know more about somebody That might
improve your

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,250
ability to predict how they're going to
fare on a, on a certain test or how

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,545
they're going to fare in terms of their
likes or whatever the problem may be.

14
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:56,494
Recall we had this example of political
leaning and Obama.

15
00:00:56,494 --> 00:01:00,270
So, not surprisingly if your political
bent is more liberal.

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,260
That was pretty strongly related to how
you feel about President Obama,

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,860
who of course is a democratic president.

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,940
So, on the liberal side of things.

19
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,340
The R squared here was pretty big.

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,350
It was 61%.

21
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,675
Saying that your political bent, Explains
about 61% of how you feel about Obama.

22
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:21,400
Again not surprising but then you might
say,

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,840
okay I've collected a number of variables
besides these two and

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,600
maybe there's something else in my data
[INAUDIBLE]

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,985
that also helps to predict who's going to
like Obama above and beyond politics.

26
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:40,520
Is there something else we can add to this
model to refine to

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,000
figure out what is going to predict who
likes Obama.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,390
Well, I kind of hunted through the data
set and some of the things I'm

29
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,650
finding might be due to a type 1 error
because I looked through the data set to

30
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,520
find what other things are associated with
ratings of Obama.

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,970
But I found some that actually make pretty
clear sense.

32
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,120
There's a good reason why these things
might be associated.

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,190
So they're not surprising.

34
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,410
I'm here showing you the univariate
results from other things that

35
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,850
seem to be associated with your ratings of
Obama.

36
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,634
These are now.

37
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:12,870
Simple linear regressions with one
predictor in the model.

38
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,660
So the outcome here is Obama rating.

39
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,810
Same outcome as before.

40
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,970
I did a simple linear regression model
with the ratings about president Clinton,

41
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,300
a former U S president, who was also a
fairly democratic.

42
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,370
You can see that when I ran that model The
beta coefficient if 0.4, so

43
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,980
every one point increase in your ratings
of

44
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,250
clinton was associated with a 0.4 increase
in your rating of Obama.

45
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,760
So there is some association here, and the
p-value Value is definitely significant.

46
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,750
And that kind of makes sense if you liked
Clinton you probably liked

47
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,650
Obama notice that this is a simple model
and people who like Clinton are likely

48
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,850
democrats people who like Obama are likely
democrats so this could be due to this.

49
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:03,150
Simple regression could be due to
confounding by politics.

50
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,130
I also wondered if healthcare,

51
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,105
how you feel about the new healthcare law
passed by Obama.

52
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,660
Some people call it ObamaCare.

53
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,850
If you were in favor of that healthcare
law, if you rated it highly, maybe then

54
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,390
you also Feel favorably towards Obama and
indeed I do find a relationship here so

55
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:25,680
every 1 point increase in your rating of
the health care law on

56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,800
a scale of 1 to 100 increased your ratings
of Obama by 0.3 so

57
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,110
it's not quite as strong as the Clinton
effect.

58
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,330
None as strong as the politics effect.

59
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,310
But is still it's still highly
significant.

60
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,990
Of course we always, always want to graph
things, so don't forget to graph.

61
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,120
You need to graph.

62
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,400
So I just did simple graphs here between,

63
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,040
here's the healthcare law on the x axis on
the left hand side here,

64
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,320
and the Obama ratings, so you can see here
there's kind of a moderate association.

65
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,190
Association between your feelings about
healthcare, and your feelings about Obama.

66
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,040
Also with President Clinton, more
favorable ratings of

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,430
Clinton tend to decorrelate with more
favorable ratings of Obama.

68
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,430
They're not as strong as the graph I
showed you for

69
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,405
politics in Obama, not surprisingly.

70
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:12,980
What seems to be some stuff going on here?

71
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,855
I then took all three of those variables,
healthcare,

72
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:23,140
Clinton, and politics, and put them into a
single regression model.

73
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,230
Predicting ratings of Obama.

74
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,940
Here's the result of that model.

75
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,380
So now I've got a multivariate regression
model with three predictors in there.

76
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,920
Your political badge, your feelings about
healthcare, your feelings about Clinton.

77
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,450
Here's the results, again here's the
parameter estimates.

78
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,550
Here's the p values, which is the thing
we're going to focus on.

79
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,160
What I can see here is that the politics
is dominant.

80
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,980
So the best predictor of your feelings
about Obama is still politics.

81
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,350
The beta coefficient is 0.56.

82
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,370
By the way, all of these things are rated
on a scale from 0 to 100, so

83
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,980
the units are somewhat comparable here.

84
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,995
So, 1-point increase in your politics
bench

85
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:06,340
towards liberal increased your feelings
about Obama by 0.56.

86
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,240
Healthcare doesn't have to,

87
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,830
this remember the relationship with
healthcare was a beta of about 0.3 before.

88
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,900
It goes down to 0.14 once I account for
politics and clinton.

89
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,550
But it's still bordering statistical
significance and

90
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,810
it's still a little bit of an effect.

91
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,800
So, in addition to your politics, if you
liked that healthcare law, it seems to

92
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,990
add a little bit to your prediction about
how you'll feel, feel, feel about Obama.

93
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,360
The beta is 0.14, so it's not huge.

94
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,560
But it's still maybe a little different
than 0.

95
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,160
Also, interestingly there also appears to
be an independent effect for Clinton.

96
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,240
So even after you adjust for your
political bent and

97
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,160
how you feel about the healthcare law,
There's still some effect left over,

98
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,710
some additional predictive power that get
by Clinton.

99
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,410
There's sort of a Clinton halo here, this
must be why they always want a Clinton to

100
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,320
come and speak at the Obama rallies and
things, people who like Clinton,

101
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,440
do tend to be more likely to like obama
independent of their political bent, and.

102
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,650
Interdependent of how they feel about
healthcare.

103
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,630
So your peeking out a little bit of
additional predictive power here

104
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,240
by throwing Clinton in the model.

105
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,400
Now, I'll show you the R squared here, So

106
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,360
remember the R squared just with politics
alone in the model was .61.

107
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,790
It goes up to .69 when we add healthcare
and Clinton to the model.

108
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,590
We're not doing.

109
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,210
[INAUDIBLE] that much better.

110
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,530
We're only explaining about 8% more of the
variance in, in feelings about Obama.

111
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:33,300
And in fact, if we account for the fact
that we now have three predictors in

112
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,860
the model, and whenever, you add an
additional predictor in the model,

113
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,320
your R square always has to go up even by
just a little bit so

114
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,090
some type type would prefer to focus on a
measure called the adjusted R

115
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,930
squared which accounts for the number of
predictors in your model.

116
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,110
We want to also always be parsimonious put
the fewest predictors in

117
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,905
our model that gives us the most bang for
our buck.

118
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:58,040
So, it's probably better here to consider
the adjusted R squared.

119
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,440
It's still, the adjusted R squared of 67%,
is still higher than 61%.

120
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,790
So we're increasing how much of the
variance we can explain here by about 6%,

121
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,630
we're getting a little bit better on our
prediction.

122
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,050
By also considering the independent
effects

123
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,510
of people's feelings about healthcare, and
people's feelings about Clinton.

124
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,800
Those things do seem to.

125
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,127
Independantly to some extent predict
feelings about obama over and

126
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:24,570
above politics.

127
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:29,232
I have also written here just the final
model out so

128
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:33,228
that you can see the final model written
out.

129
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:36,884
And we can use this model which I've
written out here.

130
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:39,420
To actually predict for a given person.

131
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,400
If I knew your political rating, and I
knew how you felt about healthcare, and

132
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,430
I knew your rating for Clinton, I could
predict how you were going to rate Obama.

133
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,970
So let's take a particular example.

134
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,180
What I had a person who had a political
leaning of 70 this means that they

135
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,540
are somewhat liberal, they are on liberal
end of things but

136
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,010
not totally liberal remember this is on a
scale of 100.

137
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,020
Their ratings of obamacare were 90 so

138
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,760
they're really in favor of the health care
reform in the US.

139
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,420
Again that's out of 100 so they're very in
favor of that.

140
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,930
And there rating Clinton was kind of
modest a 60 so its favorable but

141
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,110
not super favorable we can take these
individual values for

142
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,450
a given person for a given individual and

143
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:23,244
plug them into the model to see what their
predicted rating for Obama would be.

144
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:25,880
We can predict what they how they might
rate Obama.

145
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,760
So the predicted value again I will
sometimes abbreviate that as YI

146
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,985
hat hat meaning that's the predicted value
is equal to our intercept here was.

147
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:43,600
5.9, we've got an additional .56 points
for every one unit of politics.

148
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,060
So .56 times your political bent.

149
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,490
And actually you just plug in the number
here.

150
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,220
So that the number here.

151
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,050
This person's political bent was 70 so we
can just Plug that right in.

152
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,960
This person's rating of Obama care was 90
and the slope for,

153
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,590
for Obama care for healthcare was .14.

154
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,070
So we can do .14 times 90 plus there,

155
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,170
this slope the beta coefficient for
Clinton was .26.

156
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,790
We can multiply that by their actual value
for clinton which was 60.

157
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,080
You can multiply all of this out you will
find out that the,

158
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,170
their predictive rating for Obama is 67.7.

159
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,170
So, not super high, definitely on the
favorable end, but

160
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,667
not as high as you know, some of the
values which we saw in the data set.

161
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:27,970
So that's how you do prediction for an
individual based on a regression model.

162
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:34,170
We of course also want Test the assumption
so we should do

163
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,420
some kind of residual analyses as I talked
about in the third module for this week.

164
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,210
One of the easy ones that you can do is
you can just calculate the residuals.

165
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,140
The computer will calculate the residuals
for you so

166
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,895
these are the predicted values minus the
observed values, for ratings of Obama.

167
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:49,530
The computer will do this automatically.

168
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,410
This draft was automatically generated for
me.

169
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,330
The I can then take those residuals and
toss them in a histogram and

170
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,285
see whether or not they follow a normal
distribution.

171
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:57,870
Distribution.

172
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,130
The residuals should follow a normal
distribution.

173
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,760
And indeed it looks really good here,

174
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,450
looks like it follows a nice, normal
distribution.

175
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,070
So, even though the ratings of Obama,

176
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,250
the outcome variable, didn't perfectly
follow a normal distribution.

177
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,600
It was just slightly off.

178
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,740
Because of the central limit theorem, the
means very nicely follow a normal

179
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,840
distribution and we adequately meet that
normality assumption.

180
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,720
Even with a sample size of just 50 here.

181
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,480
The computer also generated for me some
residual plots so

182
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,410
each of the predictors graphed against the
residual for every person in the data set.

183
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,280
Remember we're looking for

184
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,860
random scatter around zero and it looks
pretty good here so we're

185
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,903
not seeing any evidence that we violated
any assumtions of linear In a regression.

186
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:44,680
I'm going to just do a second example,
just for fun.

187
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,915
Since I've been looking at the healthcare
reform in the US, what some people call

188
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:53,710
Obamacare, can we also take the variables
in our data set and try to predict.

189
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,680
What things predict that you're going to
like the healthcare reform?

190
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,988
So now, making healthcare reform that,
your ratings on that.

191
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:02,100
The outcome variable.

192
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Well, obviously, since we already saw
that,

193
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,010
if you liked healthcare you tended to like
Obama.

194
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:12,520
It makes sense that if you, like Obama
you're also going to like healthcare.

195
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,900
So we can put that in the reverse making
Obama as the predictor here and

196
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,730
healthcare, of course, it the outcome.

197
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,891
So I just did a simple linear regression
here, I did a.

198
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:21,130
Plot also.

199
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,370
And you can see that indeed, not
surprisingly, that Obama,

200
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:30,580
your feelings about Obama were strongly
related to your feelings about healthcare.

201
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,400
I then was also looking in the data set
for

202
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,850
other things that might predict your
feelings about healthcare.

203
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,270
Another one that makes a lot of sense is
politics.

204
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,110
So, if you're more liberal in your
politics,

205
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,620
indeed, that was associated with you
liking healthcare more.

206
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,250
And that was statistically significant at
the 0.05 level, not surprisingly.

207
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,920
The democrats tend to support that more.

208
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,010
Of course we showed, as I talked about
before, you know, it wasn't perfect here.

209
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,280
There's definitely some strong liberal
Democrats here that

210
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,060
don't like the healthcare.

211
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,120
And there actually are some strong
Republicans here,

212
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,480
that do like the healthcare.

213
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,189
So not perfect, but there is some
association.

214
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,580
[INAUDIBLE] there.

215
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,410
Another interesting one that I found in my
data set is how much exercise you do.

216
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:14,270
Now, this could completely be a multiple
testing issue.

217
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,190
A type one error.

218
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,360
It could be a false positive.

219
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,140
So I kind of look through my data set for

220
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,105
things that predict your ratings of health
care.

221
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:22,390
Exercise happened to pop up.

222
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,950
But since I've now looked at many
predictors.

223
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,330
Potential predictors that help here.

224
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,310
There's bound to be some that pop up as
statistically significant just by chance.

225
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,450
On the other hand, now there might be some
good reason to believe that,

226
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,960
yeah, people who exercise a lot,

227
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,180
would like Obamacare, would like the
health care reform in the U.S.

228
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,840
The health care in the U.S.

229
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,240
tends to focus on preventitive medicine
and people who exercise a lot Based it

230
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,470
may support that so there's its not really
unreasonable that these might go together.

231
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:53,060
A here's the plot now here's the actual
linear regression model so

232
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,380
exercise was in hours per week so this
regression coefficient represents that for

233
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,419
every 1 additional hour of exercise that
you did per week.

234
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,870
Your ratings of the healthcare law seem to
go up about 2.5 points,

235
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,410
and it is statistically significant.

236
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,880
So those three variables seem to predict
your ratings of healthcare in

237
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,640
the univariate picture, that is one at a
time.

238
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,590
I then want to put them together to see if
we overall can predict with

239
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,980
multiple variables who Who's going to like
the health care law in the U.S.

240
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,350
So I put them all into a single
multivariate model.

241
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,140
So here is the results of that model,
again you gotta focus on

242
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,570
the parameter estimates, that's our model
and the p-values will tell you whether or

243
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,170
not those betas are significantly
different from zero.

244
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,780
Well, looking at that model.

245
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,280
You'll notice that, Obama and

246
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,110
how you feel about Obama was actually a
stronger predictor.

247
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,450
It kind of trumped your political bent.

248
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,970
So, once I put politics and Obama both in
the model.

249
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,440
Obama stands out as being a pretty strong
predictor.

250
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,910
One unit increase in your feelings about
Obama increased your

251
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,380
feelings about his healthcare law by 0.5
points, a half a point, but

252
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,670
politics is essentially down zero, 0.039.

253
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,870
It is essentially zero, non-significant,
so there wasn't any

254
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,330
additional predictive power for politics
once I know how you feel about Obama.

255
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,130
Which, of course, has a lot to do with
your politics,

256
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,350
but seemed to trump politics here.

257
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:22,510
Once I know how you feel about Obama, then
I was able to,

258
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:28,010
I can predict how you might feel about
healthcare, but additionally,

259
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,140
Knowing how somebody's politics, political
leanings are above and beyond how they

260
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,780
feel about Obama, doesn't seem to add any
predictive power to this model.

261
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,600
The exercise does though, so your
exercise, how much you exercise does

262
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,260
appear still to be strongly related
independent of how you feel about Obama.

263
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,660
So somebody you maybe doesn't even like
Obama, but

264
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,750
is a strong exercise So likes to exercise
and likes preventive care might be

265
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,600
more likely to like health care regardless
of their policital feelings about Obama.

266
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,980
So interestingly in this one the R squared
is not super great.

267
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:08,260
So the R squared here turned out to 35%.

268
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,040
So we're only able to explain 35% of the
variability.

269
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,590
How people feel about healthcare and
actually again,

270
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,048
better to look at the adjusted R-squared.

271
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,940
The adjusted R-squared is 30% accounting
for

272
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,650
the fact that we've got three variables in
our model so we're able to

273
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,810
explain about 30% of the variance which
isn't as good as explaining.

274
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,010
We did much better on explaining who likes
Obama but

275
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,421
we've explained some of the variability.

276
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:33,223
If you, again, look carefully at politics
you see that there really isn't any

277
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,203
predictive power for politics.

278
00:15:35,203 --> 00:15:40,190
Once I've got Obama and exercise in the
model, of course I'll again Obama and

279
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,550
politics are strongly related, we've seen
that throughout this week.

280
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,520
So those we wold call those sort of
collinear, we call them highly correlated.

281
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,070
And so when you put both two highly
correlated things in the model, it

282
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,170
tends to be that one of them is going to
dominate So Obama tends to dominate there.

283
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,020
Once I've accounted for Obama, there's no
additional predictive power for politics.

284
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,900
So I'm actually going to

285
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,980
drop it out of the model because it's not
adding anything.

286
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,050
There's no independent effect of political
bent after accounting For

287
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,150
your ratings of Obama and how much you
exercise.

288
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,030
So we're going to just drop it from the
model.

289
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:17,660
My final model, therefore, will encode
just how much you exercise and

290
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,730
your feelings about Obama.

291
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,790
Here's my final model.

292
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,380
My R squared is still you know, it's 29%.

293
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,190
It only goes down just slightly when I
drop out the politics from the model.

294
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,260
I'm able to explain 29% of the variants
here.

295
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:34,740
And of course you always want to test your
assumptions to your residual plots so,

296
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,620
I'm showing you here the residual plots
for the predictors and for

297
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,475
this particular model.
