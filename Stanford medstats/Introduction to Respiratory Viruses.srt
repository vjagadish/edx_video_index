1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:06,610
This presentation is about respiratory
viruses at the end of which you should

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:11,550
be able to define the different syndromes
caused by respiratory viruses you should

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,350
be able to name the main viral pathogens
causing respiratory infections.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,280
I'll explain the pathogenesis of
respiratory viral infections and finally

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,000
explain the techniques used for diagnosing
specific types of viral infection.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,640
To underscore the importance of viral
infections as a cause of death world wide,

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,520
I've pulled these data from 2004.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,710
From the World Health Organization and it
was published in 2008,

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,530
that indicate the cause of deaths around
the world from infectious diseases.

10
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,240
And 17% of these of death,

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,610
deaths are attributable to acute
respiratory infections.

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,336
The types of infections that respiratory
viruses cause,

13
00:00:56,336 --> 00:01:01,810
caused include the common cold which we
all have had.

14
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:07,200
Many times in our lives, pharyngitis,
infection of the back of the throat,

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,660
associated typically with a sore throat.

16
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,100
Laryngitis, infection of the voice box,
associated with a,

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,450
a hoarse voice or a loss of voice.

18
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,150
Laryngotracheobronchitis, occupying those
anatomical areas.

19
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,140
Typically causing croup in young children.

20
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,150
Bronchitis, infection of the larger,.

21
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,570
Airways,.

22
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:36,740
And, Bronchiolitis, infection of the very
small, terminal airways.

23
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,430
If the infection in the lower respiratory
tract spills from the bronchials or

24
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,490
the bronchi into the lung parenchyma,
there is bronchopneumonia.

25
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,360
And finally, there's a very in artful term
called the flu, which is meant to

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,870
refer to an influenza like illness, but it
is actually a bit of slang.

27
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,889
But you know what it's like to have the
flu.

28
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:05,040
This schematic indicates the different
types of respiratory viral infection,

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,960
according to the anatomical location.

30
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,610
And again, they're divided between upper
respiratory tract infections,

31
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,530
which are what they sound like in the
upper part of the respiratory tract,

32
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,480
including ear infections, rhinitis or the
common cold with the runny nose,.

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,460
And pharyngitis or laryngitis, or
infections in

34
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,740
the lower respiratory tract with the terms
that I've already introduced.

35
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,210
The types of viral pathogens,

36
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,050
that we encounter during life are listed
on this slide.

37
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:43,270
They include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses,
adenoviruses,

38
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,430
parainfluenza viruses, respiratory
syncytial virus or

39
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,380
RSV, metapneumovirus, parvovirus and
influenza virus.

40
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,790
So many viruses like to cause illness in
the respiratory tract.

41
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:03,300
And with regards to tropism, where the
infection tends to hang out, for

42
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,110
rhinovirus, most of the infections, as you
can see by the height of this.

43
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,950
Curve.

44
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,330
Cause infection in the upper respirators
tract in the nose, the common cold.

45
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,310
Different viruses that are listed on the
left cause infection in

46
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,340
different parts of the body, shown across
the top.

47
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,340
And you can see in general, where the
viruses tend to hang out,

48
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,180
in the respiratory tract.

49
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,440
There is a lot of overlap between the
different types of

50
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,490
respiratory syndromes caused by the
viruses, that this gives some general.

51
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,410
General picture of, the types of
infection.

52
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,580
Some generalities about respiratory
viruses.

53
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,240
So most of the respiratory viruses that
were listed are RNA viruses.

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,480
There is an exception, and that's the
adenovirus, which is a DNA virus.

55
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,660
Most of the respiratory viruses have
multiple serotypes,

56
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,020
multiple types that can infect you, each
year of your life, if you wish.

57
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,720
So, rhinoviruses, for example, there's
about a hundred.

58
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,670
Si if you add one rhino virus infection
per year and

59
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,410
you lived to experience all of them you
would be old.

60
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,560
RSV is an exception to that though in that
there's only a single type.

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,600
In North America most respiratory viruses
circulate during the fall and

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,920
winter months when people are in doors
sharing their pathogens with each other.

63
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,950
Most of the viruses spread by droplet
aerosolization.

64
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,440
And most of them spread in places like
schools, in homes, or

65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,740
in other crowded environments.

66
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,720
I've already mentioned there's substantial
overlap between the different types of

67
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,700
viral syndromes.

68
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,680
With regards to the pathogenesis of viral
infections,

69
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,240
in general they enter in droplets through
the mucosa of the nose or the eyes.

70
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,090
They can not become in the mouth,
interestingly.

71
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,340
Once they cross the mucosa, they bind to
surface proteins and

72
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,870
then they enter the cells after they have
bound.

73
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,320
In the cells, they release their genome,
they synthesize new viral proteins and

74
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,370
progeny genomes, they assemble and they
get released to infect other cells.

75
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,530
After they've gone through this sequence
of cellular infection.

76
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,860
They then spread from cell to cell, down
the respiratory tract.

77
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,480
And in en route down the tract, they
caused substantial cellular necrosis and

78
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,150
an associated inflammatory reaction which
gives rise to

79
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,850
the symptoms you may experience.

80
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,420
They also stimulate host immunologic
responses and

81
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,620
mediator release, so cytokines for

82
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,709
example, and the release of those
mediators may cause additional symptoms.

83
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:50,710
When the cellular necrosis and debris that
is impairing the transmission of

84
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,210
gas exchange in the terminal airways you
can get hypoxia,

85
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,860
when the lower respiratory tract is
infected, because the viruses may impair,

86
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,040
host immune response that caused immune
dysfunction.

87
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,020
You may get a secondary bacterial
infection referred to

88
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,830
as a super infection.

89
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:17,130
Diagnosing viral infections is usually
just based upon clinical examination.

90
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,850
We usually don't care what specific virus
is causing us to have a runny nose.

91
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,230
Or a sore throat.

92
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,360
However, there are some circumstances
where we do care.

93
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,880
So, for investigating an epidemic of
severe disease,

94
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,980
we want to know what's causing that severe
disease.

95
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,280
If we're trying to decide that the patient
is sick enough that they

96
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,180
might benefit from antiviral therapy, we
need to

97
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,760
know they're infected with the virus that
is susceptible to antiviral therapy.

98
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,120
If we're looking to control infections
transmitted in the hospital then we

99
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,830
may end up wanting to cohort patients who
have the same type of viral infection

100
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,450
rather than mixing and matching different
patients with different infections.

101
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,850
If we make a viral diagnosis we may be
able to avoid antibiotics.

102
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,940
Therapy because we have a diagnosis, and
it's not a bacteria.

103
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,900
And if you're doing research studies and
trying to figure out the epidemiology of

104
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,020
an infection, you may want to make a
specific diagnosis.

105
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:19,240
The final slide shows the different types
of diagnostic tests available,

106
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,070
when approaching the cause of a viral
infection.

107
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,310
And the types of tests are shown along the
left.

108
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,060
One can do it by Cytology.

109
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,000
Meaning looking at the cellular.

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,030
Spot of the host and that can give you a
hint as to what the infection is,

111
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:41,330
you look at the specimen under microscopic
the nice part is it is widely available,

112
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,670
but it is not definitive,

113
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,380
you can't tell what the specific virus is,
based upon cytology, you can get a.

114
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:47,880
Clue.

115
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,720
On the other hand, if you take a sample
from the patients respiratory track and

116
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,080
you send it to the viral laboratory and

117
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,400
the viral laboratory puts the specimen
onto a variety of

118
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,170
different tissue cultures and looks for so
called cytopathic genic effect.

119
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,980
You can make a diagnosis of a specific
viral infection.

120
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,980
The advantages are, the, you can look for
multiple viruses at the same time.

121
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,980
The disadvantages that it's slow and
rather expensive.

122
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,850
The next two detection of viral nucleic
acids.

123
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:27,600
By something like PCR or detection of
viral proteins through immulogic

124
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,560
fluorescence technique for example are
both rapid and they're very sensitive and

125
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,130
specific but they're both quite expensive
and then finally one can

126
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,480
diagnose a viral infection based upon the
host antibody response, that is Serology.

127
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,740
You measure it when the patient first
comes in and

128
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,190
a couple weeks later, to determine what
the specific infection is.

129
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,830
The problem is it takes a long time.

130
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,850
You have to get specimens a couple of
weeks apart.

131
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,000
And therefore you may not make the
diagnosis in

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,970
time to impact any sort of intervention.
