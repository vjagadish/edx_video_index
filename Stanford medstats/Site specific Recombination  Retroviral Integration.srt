1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,670
Good morning, students.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,670
Today we are going to talk about
retroviral integration.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,000
If you want to get more information on
this I've got a reference at

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,880
the bottom of this slide.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,850
So, here we've go, I'm going to draw for
you retroviral genome here.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:23,889
And this is the retroviral genome after
reverse

7
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:30,060
transcriptase that's converted to
retroviral RNA into double stranded DNA.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,620
And the retroviral genome has a long

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,550
terminal repeat of the same sequence at
both ends.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,440
And for the purposes of this discussion,
this will be the HIV genome.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:56,390
[BLANK_AUDIO]

12
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,540
Because of its medical importance, and

13
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,040
we will have a little blow-up of the HIV
genome.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,340
Now, let's just draw a few nucleotides
here, for illustration.

15
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,590
That's the upper strand and here's the
lower strand.

16
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:21,058
And these two nucleotides right here are
critical for

17
00:01:21,058 --> 00:01:28,021
what's going to happen next, because,

18
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:36,489
it's going to turn out that the retroviral
integrase,

19
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:42,700
[SOUND] will remove two nucleotides from

20
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:50,060
the three prime ends, both three prime
ends.

21
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,705
So I'll remove two of the nucleotides from
this particular end.

22
00:01:56,705 --> 00:02:00,897
[COUGH] Leaving us with a,

23
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:06,450
recessed three prime hydroxyl group.

24
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,600
Now I'm going to draw the target of the
retroviral integration event.

25
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,830
And that'll be the host genome.

26
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,670
The retrovirus wants to jump into the host
genome.

27
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,742
So, we will draw the host genome for you.

28
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:21,127
[SOUND]

29
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:27,170
[BLANK_AUDIO]

30
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,574
Double stranded DNA there.

31
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:31,980
[COUGH]

32
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,310
And I'm going to show you the retroviral
genome curled up.

33
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:43,009
And it's curled up because the retroviral
integrase will hold onto both LTRs.

34
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,970
So, we've got the two unpaired nucleotides
at the five prime end of the upper strand

35
00:02:50,970 --> 00:03:00,550
in the previous diagram, ending in a three
prime hydroxyl here.

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,510
And two unpaired nucleotide of five prime
end here.

37
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,600
Other stand, the lower strand on the
previous diagram, ending in the three

38
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,550
prime hydroxyl there, and these three
prime hydroxyls will be used

39
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:25,070
by the integrase to catalyze nucleophilic
attacks on the host DNA.

40
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,360
So, we will draw that.

41
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,740
And the nucleophilic attacks occur offset
from each other.

42
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,270
And the offset here, I'm going to put in
black brackets.

43
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:44,428
And those that bracketed sequence between

44
00:03:44,428 --> 00:03:50,172
the two sites of nucleophilic attack is
going to

45
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:55,916
be destined to become a short direct
repeat,

46
00:03:55,916 --> 00:04:02,290
and you'll see that by the time we're
finished.

47
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,436
[BLANK_AUDIO]

48
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:14,510
So, [COUGH] just to review,

49
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:20,971
the integrase catalyzes

50
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:26,816
nucleophilic attacks

51
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:32,352
on the host DNA, both

52
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:39,050
strands of the host DNA.

53
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,430
[BLANK_AUDIO]

54
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:49,370
And I'm going to show you the results of
that, those nucleophilic attacks.

55
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,140
So starting, and this time I'm going to
start with the lower.

56
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,553
I'll draw the diagram from the lower
strand,

57
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:04,087
three prime ends of the host DNA, moving
over.

58
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:07,660
[BLANK_AUDIO]

59
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,370
To that site.

60
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:17,340
And then, that nucleophilic attack

61
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:25,666
actually creates a covalent bond with the
retroviral DNA.

62
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:32,103
Five prime

63
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:37,110
[COUGH].

64
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:44,690
Now, if I do, draw in, let me finish
drawing the bottom strand here.

65
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:50,376
Here's the end of the bottom strand.

66
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:52,377
Five premium.

67
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:59,008
Now, starting from the three prime

68
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:04,976
end of the upper strand will show

69
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:12,506
you result of the nucleophilic attack.

70
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:17,990
[BLANK_AUDIO]

71
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,370
On the upper strand.

72
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,190
And the lower strand, the upper strand,
I'm sorry, let's draw it in

73
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:33,100
blue, goes all the way up to there, there
we go.

74
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:39,880
So, this configuration's a little hard to
see,

75
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,720
so what we need to do is to pull the DNA
ends out so you can see everything.

76
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,090
I'm not going to, I'm not going to change
anything.

77
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,530
All the bonds are still there.

78
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,920
It's just the geometry will change for
ease of viewing.

79
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,609
So, again, if I start with the three prime
end of the lower strand.

80
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,430
Of course, we want to keep out color
coding.

81
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:12,100
So we're, if we're talking about the three
prime end of

82
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,130
the lower strand, we want that host DNA to
be blue.

83
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:21,460
It's going to be covalent linked to the
retroviral DNA.

84
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:27,020
There's the retroviral DNA.

85
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,870
And it's protruding five prime end.

86
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:40,440
[COUGH] The same thing goes and then.

87
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,251
[BLANK_AUDIO]

88
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:56,150
The continuation, the continuation of the
host DNA over here.

89
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,260
I'm leaving the gap there on purpose.

90
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,589
You can see why I have to do that.

91
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:08,918
Because if I draw, start drawing the five
prime end of

92
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:15,560
the retroviral upper DNA strand, that only
goes up to this point.

93
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,320
Let me draw it a little more carefully.

94
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,170
It only goes up to that point.

95
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,430
Because, it doesn't reach all the way

96
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:34,450
over because there's a gap, that's exactly
the distance that,

97
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,230
between the two nucleophilic attacks on
the upper part of the diagram.

98
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,380
Now if I continue drawing the retroviral
DNA.

99
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,233
[BLANK_AUDIO]

100
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:52,190
I come up to here.

101
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,490
Let me curl this thing down to make it a
little easier for

102
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,400
you to see.

103
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:01,900
Okay.

104
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:09,692
And then we have the like point

105
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:15,130
of covalent attachment there and voila.

106
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,788
We've got another gap over here.

107
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:27,610
So, that is the previous diagram stretched
out.

108
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,400
Nothing has changed.

109
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:37,900
What happens next is that nuclease comes
along and removes

110
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:44,900
the protruding two nucleotides at the far
front ends, the unpaired two nucleotides.

111
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,825
And then, host polymerase,

112
00:09:49,825 --> 00:09:57,311
we'll draw that in blue, host polymerase,

113
00:09:57,311 --> 00:10:04,610
DNA polymerase and ligase repair the gaps.

114
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:12,690
[BLANK_AUDIO]

115
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,200
Okay now, I'll draw that.

116
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,053
Here's the polymerase coming along and
then the ligase finishing the job,

117
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:25,364
polymerase coming along and ligase
finishing the job.

118
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:26,629
And voila!

119
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:31,970
You've got the retroviral DNA integrated
into the host genome.

120
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,580
And the epilogue is, of course,

121
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,100
understanding retroviral integration has
led to the development of HIV

122
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,350
inhibitors which are now being used to
treat patients with HIV infection.

123
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,340
Thank you so much.
