1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,270
[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,080
In this next module I'm going to talk more
about how to interpret time

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,190
changing predictors.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,700
So we saw in the last module that when you
have a time changing predictor in

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,390
your GEE module.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,010
Interpreting the beta cooefficient can be
confusing because that beta

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,825
coefficient will encompass both within
subjects effects and between subjects

8
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:31,240
effects; you won't know just by looking at
the beta which of those you have.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,630
Might have some of both and in the.

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,330
Previous example that I gave in the last
module these were made up data so

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,700
I happen to know that I built in a lot of
within subjects effects.

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,400
So I knew that the beta coefficient
largely represented within

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,060
subjects effects.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,460
That is that if the chemical level went up
a person's depression level went down.

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,990
But what if you.

16
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,000
Of course most of the time you haven't
made up the data so

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,970
you don't know ahead of time.

18
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,300
Time.

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,070
So, I made a couple, I made up a couple of
data sets just so

20
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,810
we could explore this issue.

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,060
So here's the original data set that I
made up and, of course,

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,690
I specifically sat the base line value of
the chemical level to be the same for

23
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,520
everybody so that it did not correlate
with depression.

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,690
Scores had, base line.

25
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,810
So that most of what I have here are
within-subjects effects.

26
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,160
I then made up a second data set, where I
purposely built in

27
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,830
both between-subjects effects and
within-subjects effects.

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,398
So for example.

29
00:01:27,398 --> 00:01:31,046
If you look at the base line chemical
level and the base line depression score

30
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:34,808
values, you'll notice that the people with
the highest depression scores,

31
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:38,330
levels of 50, had the lowest chemical
levels, 200 and 100.

32
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,200
The person with the highest chemical level
in their brain,

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,180
a thousand, had the lowest depression
score of 15.

34
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,740
So I built in some nice between subjects
effects here.

35
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,480
I also built in some within subject
effects.

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,770
So for example for

37
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:56,070
subject number one I made their chemical
level go up at time interval.

38
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,550
I also made their depression score go down
at every time interval.

39
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,840
So the change in chemical seems to also be
related to the change in depression score.

40
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,530
I then made a third example, where there
is only between subjects effects.

41
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,516
So in this example,

42
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:16,700
I made the base line chemical level highly
related to the base line depression score.

43
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,280
So very high scores.

44
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,700
Very, that, tended to go with low chemical
levels.

45
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,790
Very high chemical levels tended to go
with low depression scores.

46
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,560
However, I kept the chemical level in the
brain at about the same within a subject.

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,010
So you can see subject one hovered around
500, subject two hovered right around 700.

48
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,970
And I also didn't make the depression
scores change all

49
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,130
that much over time either.

50
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,440
So there's, there can't be really any
correlation between changes in

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,410
chemical levels and changes.

52
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,230
Which is in the depression score.

53
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,770
I then went ahead and graphed the last two
data sets.

54
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,460
I've already shown you the graph of the
first data set.

55
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,350
But just to show you this is example two.

56
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,330
This has both between subjects effects and
within subjects effects.

57
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,030
You can see that picture here.

58
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,147
So for example ID number one,

59
00:02:58,147 --> 00:03:01,810
their depression score is in this blue
solid line.

60
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,960
Their chemical level is in the blue dotted
line.

61
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,650
ID number two is in red.

62
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,020
Their chemical level is in the dotted, red
dotted line there.

63
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,320
Depression score is the red, solid line.

64
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,910
And what you'll notice here.

65
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:19,060
Is that blue, the ID number one has a
pretty high depression level.

66
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,410
They also have a pretty low chemical
level.

67
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,570
Their dotted line is way down here.

68
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:28,720
On the other hand, ID two, person two
here, has a low depression score.

69
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,510
Their, the solid red line is down below
here.

70
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,020
And a higher chemical level.

71
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,230
Their chemical level is up on the top
here.

72
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,710
So that's representing cross sectional
between subjects effects.

73
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,920
One is high in depression score and, and
is low in chemical.

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,569
The other is high in chemical and low in
depression.

75
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,430
You do see some within subjects changes as
well.

76
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,590
So for example, ID number one, their
chemical level is going up over time and

77
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,950
their depression score is going down over
time.

78
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,976
And I've separated out each subject here,
so you can see that as this red

79
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:06,150
level line goes up, their depression score
does tend to go down for ID number one.

80
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,620
For subject number two, it just goes,
doesn't change too much over time.

81
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,650
For subject number three, their chemical
level experiences an upward lip here, and

82
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,760
their depression level correspondingly
goes down.

83
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,980
So I've built in some within subjects
effects as well.

84
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,900
You can see those here.

85
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,090
ID number five, there's not much change.

86
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,260
ID six, not much change.

87
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,130
And again, you can see the cross sectional
effects cause higher.

88
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,360
People with higher depression scores tend
to have lower chemical levels.

89
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,890
And then example three is the all
between-subject effects.

90
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,920
I've graphed the individual subjects so

91
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,650
you can see that the higher your blue
line, the lower your red line.

92
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,800
But not much going on over time.

93
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,330
Everybody staying pretty flat in both
their depression, and

94
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,590
especially in their chemical levels over
time.

95
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,370
So you can see all of that picture here.

96
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,090
So that's just showing it to you
graphically.

97
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,070
And then when I run GEE models for these
data,

98
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,270
what you'll notice is that, I get, so for
example, I get for

99
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,652
the example one, this all the, this is
mostly within-subjects effects.

100
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:09,320
[SOUND] I get a beta coefficient of
negative .017.

101
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,390
As we saw before, it's highly significant.

102
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,300
For a model two, this is both, within N
between subjects effects.

103
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,520
The beta coefficient changes, because it's
a different data set.

104
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,260
So they wouldn't be expected to be exactly
the same.

105
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,680
But it's negative, [INAUDIBLE], and, you
know, [INAUDIBLE].

106
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,680
In the same direction, also highly
significant.

107
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
And then when we had only between subjects
effects,

108
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,930
again, again I get a beta coefficient
that's negative, highly significant.

109
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,590
So, just by looking at those beta
coefficients and p values,

110
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,270
I can't distinguish which, whether or not
I have between versus subjects effects.

111
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,760
So what do you do to distinguish those
when you're dealing with data

112
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,520
tests that you didn't make up?

113
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,560
How do you differentiate?

114
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,180
So, there's a couple of different things
you can do.

115
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,030
So first of all, if you want to isolate,
are there a lot of between-subjects

116
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,360
effects, you need to graph things, examine
things, cross sectionally.

117
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,820
You're looking for cross sectional
relationships at specific time points.

118
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,520
So for example, you can graph.

119
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,315
The base line level of the chemicals
against the base line level of

120
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:07,833
the depression scores and

121
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:12,160
see if those are correlated cross
sectionally across different people.

122
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,580
To look for within-subjects effects,

123
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,010
there's a couple of different things you
can do.

124
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,550
So, one thing you could do.

125
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,338
Is to take say the base line level of the
chemical in the brain and

126
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:24,320
make an interaction with time.

127
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,563
And the reason you might want to interact
a variable with time is that, remember,

128
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:30,571
a predictor with time interaction,
assuming that we're now talking about

129
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:34,060
a time independent predictor like the base
line value that doesn't change over time.

130
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,260
If you interact that with time.

131
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,180
This will only be represent within
subjects effects.

132
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,610
So, a predictor times time only represents
within subjects effects.

133
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,400
So, that's going to all be the all within
subject effects and

134
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,370
there are occasions actually where I will
end up deciding in my final model.

135
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,714
To use the base line value and

136
00:06:52,714 --> 00:06:56,010
interact it with time rather than the, use
the time changing value.

137
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,050
So for example I've done some, shown you
some data on calcium intake and

138
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,630
bone marrow content.

139
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,790
I could put those both into a model, and
have both calcium and

140
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,840
bone marrow content be changing.

141
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,967
Or what I might end up doing at the end of
the day is taking the base

142
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:14,040
line calcium level and interacting that
with time.

143
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,250
And using that in my final model because
then I know that somebody who is at

144
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,600
a high level of calcium that,

145
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,870
that's predicting their changes over time,
in in bone mineral content.

146
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,418
I've isolated the within-subjects effects,
so

147
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:27,390
sometimes you end up changing the model at
the end of the.

148
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:27,890
Of the day.

149
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,280
You can also examine correlations between
the change in

150
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,630
the time dependent predictor and the
change in the repeated measures outcome.

151
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,210
Within subjects effects we are talking
about changes, so

152
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,960
you can calculate the changes for the
predictors and the changes for

153
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,600
the outcome and try to correlate those,
you know, graphically for example.

154
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,480
So I went ahead and did some of these here
just to show you.

155
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,330
So I looked for cross sectional
relationships at base line.

156
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,332
So clearly for that first example one,
where I only had mostly within

157
00:07:57,332 --> 00:08:01,955
subjects effects I gave everybody the same
chemical level at base line, so

158
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:06,940
we have no relationship between depression
score and chemical level at base line.

159
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,398
For the one where I had kind of both types
of effects, you can see that there is.

160
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:14,103
Some relationship cross-sectionally here
between Depression level, and

161
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:15,950
Chemical-scored base line.

162
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,744
And an even stronger relationship where,
for

163
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:19,980
the days that were ahead only between
subjects effects.

164
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,908
So that's telling me where there are,

165
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:25,180
at least where there are some between
subjects effects.

166
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,984
I could then also take the base line value
of Chemical Level, and

167
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:31,210
interact it with time.

168
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,460
Time, I actually can't do that with the
first data set because everybody has

169
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,810
exact same base line values so,

170
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,400
your base line value clearly doesn't
predict your changes over time.

171
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,150
However, when I did that with the second
data set that does have,

172
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,200
some within subjects, some between
subjects,

173
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,140
effects I take their base line chemical
level which is not changing over time.

174
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,010
I interacted with time.

175
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,470
This will all only represent
within-subjects effects, and indeed that

176
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,230
one comes out to be significant 'cause we
do have within-subjects effects there.

177
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,220
Whereas, for the second data set, sorry,
the third data set where

178
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,830
there's only between-subjects effects,
this comes out to be non-significant.

179
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,118
So that can help you again to, tease out
if it's within subjects effects and

180
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:11,803
you might end up choosing to model that
time changing predictor as

181
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:15,640
something static as just the base line
value at the end of the day.

182
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,310
And, then finally we can compare the
change in

183
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,870
depression scores to the change in
chemical levels.

184
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,380
So what I've done here.

185
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,600
Here's my first example data set though
within subjects.

186
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,350
Here is the second one which has both, and

187
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,400
this is the one that only has
between-subjects.

188
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,320
And so what I've done is I've taken
everybody's values between any two

189
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,260
time points.

190
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,050
And subtracted them.

191
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,150
So I calculated the change in chemical
level from time point one to

192
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,330
time point two for everybody and then from
time point two to time point three for

193
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,830
everybody, and then from time point three
to time point four.

194
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:56,010
I also calculated the change in depression
score for each of those time intervals.

195
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,750
And I'm just showing those graphically to
show if they correlate.

196
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,460
And indeed you can see that for

197
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,570
the data set where there's a lot of within
subjects effects, a big increase in

198
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,100
chemical level does correspond to a big
change in depression scores.

199
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,680
For this data set where there was some
within subjects effects.

200
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,620
Sort of both.

201
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,030
Some increase in chemical level
correspondent to some decrease in

202
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,510
depression score for the day.

203
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,022
But it's only between subjects effects,

204
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:22,220
they don't see much relationship between
the changes here.
