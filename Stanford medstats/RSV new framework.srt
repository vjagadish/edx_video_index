1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,210
Today we're going to be talking about a
virus that

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,450
infects virtually every child in North
America before their second birthday.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,440
And the most common disease that this
virus causes in little people,

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,130
is a condition called RSV bronchiolitis.

5
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:22,570
RSV or respiratory syncytial virus can
cause a minor cold in an adult,

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,860
but physicians usually see this infection
when it's causing an infection of

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,890
the small airways bronchiolitis in a child
under the age of two.

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,660
So, let's use our frame work to help us
understand what's going on with

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,800
this little guy.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,990
An eight month old boy whose being brought
into the hospital ER

11
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,770
on a snowy December night.

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,740
His mother is scared because he has a high
fever.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,600
And seems to be struggling to breathe.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,100
Because of this, he hasn't been able to
sleep or feed well for the past 24 hours.

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,840
You can see right away, when you first
meet this child, that he's irritable,

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,020
breathing faster than normal, and it works
like he's working pretty hard to breathe.

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,870
The muscles of his neck and abdomen are
clearly trying to help out,

18
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,860
even his nostrils are flaring, and there's
clear rhinorrhea, or

19
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,820
fluid running out of his nose.

20
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,700
The nurse in the ER has taped a monitor to
his big toe,

21
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,460
to detect the amount of oxygen in his
blood.

22
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,020
And she tells you, this baby's oxygen
saturation is slightly below normal.

23
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,230
When you examine him you also hear a
wheezy sound as he breathes and you've

24
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,240
noticed that he seems to be grunting a
little bit when he breathes as well.

25
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,710
Your preceptor tells you that given the
time of year and the baby's symptoms.

26
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,520
It's highly likely, this little guy has an
RSV infection.

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,330
RSV is an enveloped RNA virus with two
large glyco proteins, F and

28
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,100
G, that are important for immunity and
pathogenesis.

29
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,710
The F protein is involved in fusion of the
virus and host cell plasma membranes,

30
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,290
forming the sinsisha that can be seen in
vitro with specific cell cultures.

31
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,280
This explains where RSV got its name.

32
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,420
To definitively diagnose RSV, you could
ask a virology lab at the hospital to

33
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,080
test for RSV in a swab or aspirate from
the nasopharyngeal space.

34
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,180
Because RSV doesn't usually live in or
colonize healthy people.

35
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,800
Finding it in any of the respiratory
secretions means the patient has

36
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,380
the infection.

37
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,210
From late October to early March, lots of
babies are brought to the E.R.

38
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,670
with these symptoms.

39
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,020
Some of them will even die from this
disease.

40
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,210
This child's dad has also been sick, but
only with a minor cold.

41
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,560
He may have sneezed nearby and our patient
breathed in the virus.

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,690
This is one of the reasons we see so many
RSV infections during the winter months.

43
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,720
When people spend more time indoors, in
close quarters.

44
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,400
Once the RSV got inside of our patient,
his immune

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,640
system recognized a viral invasion and
deployed some chemical messengers.

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,610
Things like cytokines and leukotreines to
try and protect him.

47
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,340
And as a result, the upper respiratory
tract started secreting mucus to try and

48
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,150
stop the virus from moving further down
the respiratory tract.

49
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,000
The, the blood vessels in this area also
became a bit leaky and blood flow to

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,770
the upper respiratory tract increased as
well, so that white blood cells and other

51
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,610
protective factors could get to the virus
in the hopes of stopping it in its tracks.

52
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,670
The extra mucus and the vasal dilation in
the baby's nasal

53
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:46,560
passages cause the congestion and the
runny nose that's making him so miserable.

54
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,430
And the chemical messengers also caused
his temperature set point to rise,

55
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,230
giving him a fever.

56
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,180
But unfortunately in this case,

57
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,770
the virus kept moving down the respiratory
tract despite the efforts of

58
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,990
the respiratory cilia in the airways
trying to beat it back upwards.

59
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:10,770
And also despite the increased respiratory
secretions and blood flow to that area.

60
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,190
Now these weren't the immune system's
efforts to stop the virus from

61
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,740
causing more harm.

62
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,620
But all of these changes also contributed
to the symptoms that

63
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,710
brought this little guy into the hospital.

64
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,410
If the virus had been stopped at any of

65
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,140
the early stages in the nasal passages for
example.

66
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:34,090
Our baby would have ended up with a milder
Upper Respiratory Tract Infection or URTI.

67
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:40,760
A rhinitis, a pharyngitis or a laryngitis,
depending on where the virus had stopped.

68
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,800
But because the innoculin, or

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,450
the amount of virus that our patient first
breathed in, was pretty substantial.

70
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,290
And, because his immune system wasn't
strong enough to

71
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,170
win this battle in the early stages, the
virus managed to move

72
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,828
deeper into the lower respiratory tract,
invading the bronchioles and the alveoli.

73
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:07,060
In the bronchioles, this child's immune
system kept on trying to protect him.

74
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,360
Trying to prevent the virus from going any
further.

75
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,990
The epithelium of the small airways began
to sluff off.

76
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,370
More mucus was released into the lumen.

77
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,890
And the walls to the bronchials became
swollen as blood flowed to

78
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,780
the area increased.

79
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,290
All of these things were immune system
attempts mediated by

80
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:30,550
chemical messengers to block the further
passage of the virus into the lungs.

81
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,410
But they also made it really hard for our
little patient to breathe

82
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,460
because the diameter of each tube was made
so much smaller.

83
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,850
The narrowed airways also caused the
wheezing sounds that you heard when you

84
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,950
examined him.

85
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,280
And his grunting was actually an effort to

86
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,540
create positive pressure to keep those
small airways open.

87
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,020
Often, this narrowing of the bronchioles
can trigger prolonged coughing spells

88
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,720
as a child tries to clear some of those
secretions from his airways.

89
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,750
This bronchiolar hyperreactivity might
make you think about asthma and

90
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,820
the two can be very similar in terms of
their clinical presentation.

91
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,880
In fact, there is an ongoing debate about
whether or

92
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,480
not RSV bronchiolitis is maybe just the
first manifestation of

93
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,650
asthma in a child who had an underlying
predisposition to the disease.

94
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,440
Or whether the RSV broncholitis caused
some kind of

95
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,450
damage that predisposes a child to asthma
attacks later on.

96
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,060
When RSV gets down in to the bronchioles
and

97
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,050
the alveoli the lungs can't do their job
of oxygenating the blood very well

98
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,190
because the diffusion interface gets
thicker than it should be.

99
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,320
And this is because of the increased
secretions and

100
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,270
the edema at that interface.

101
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,240
This means that carbon dioxide and

102
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,190
other waste products in the blood, can't
get out as efficiently.

103
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,350
And oxygen in the inhaled air can't
diffuse into the blood as

104
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,760
quickly as it should.

105
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,770
Remember the nurse who told you that this
baby's oxygen saturation was slightly low?

106
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,515
Well, it's likely that this baby's lungs
we're able to exchange gasses as

107
00:07:09,515 --> 00:07:12,227
efficiently as they do when he's healthy.

108
00:07:12,227 --> 00:07:17,309
The good news is that RSV doesn't change
much from year to year and while we don't

109
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:22,541
yet have an effective vaccine to routinely
prevent RSV infection in all children,

110
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:27,125
we do have a way of protecting some high
risk babies from this infection.

111
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:33,080
By giving them passive antibody protection
from the virus during the winter months.

112
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,010
The difference between these two methods
of prevention,

113
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,740
is that the first kind, vaccination,

114
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,720
involves triggering the immune system to
mount its own long-lasting.

115
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,580
Testing response by exposing it

116
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,540
to an inactivated version of the original
pathogen.

117
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,640
Passive antibody protection involves
giving

118
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,620
a child the product of an immune response,
the kind of immunoglobulins that.

119
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,740
Are typically made to fight a virus like
this.

120
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,390
The only downside is that these passive
anti-bodies don't last very long, so

121
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,620
they need to be given monthly to high risk
children during the winter months.

122
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:14,860
Babies who are at risk of getting really
sick from an RSV infection,

123
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,800
fall into a few categories.

124
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,090
If they were born prematurely or if they
have some degree of chronic lung disease,

125
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,160
and that's often a result of the
prematurity.

126
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,670
If they have a form of congenital heart
disease,

127
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:33,110
that reduces the oxygen saturation of
their blood to start out with.

128
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,720
So a further reduction due to an RSV
infection would really cause trouble.

129
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,990
And then, there are children who are born
with neuromuscular disorders like

130
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,880
cerebral palsy, who lack the muscular
strength or

131
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,310
coordination to cough out the secretions
and successfully clear their airways.

132
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,860
These are also considered high risk
children.

133
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,510
And finally, if a child is immune
suppressed for any reason, these are all

134
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,310
children who would be good candidates for
monthly doses of immunoglobulin.

135
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,090
Luckily, even though our patient was
suffering from bronchiolitis,

136
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,910
he did well on supportive therapy in the
hospital.

137
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,400
He received supplemental oxygen delivered.

138
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,850
Through a face mask.

139
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,000
And, he received fluid and some glucose
through an intravenous line.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,270
So, you can see from this baby's ordeal,

141
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,620
that knowing the characteristics of the
microbe RSV, how it enters and

142
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,690
exits the host, as well as the fact that
the virus has a tendency to colonize,

143
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,600
persist, and replicate in the small
airways of a young child.

144
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,770
This knowledge can inform our prevention
efforts and our treatment strategies.

145
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,940
Similarly, recognizing that the immune
systems early efforts to

146
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,920
eliminate the virus can actually cause
many of symptoms of the disease.

147
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,520
This can facilitate the timely diagnosis
and

148
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,120
treatment of patients like this little
boy.

149
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,399
