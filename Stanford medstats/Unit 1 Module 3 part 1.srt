1
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,190
In this next module,

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,012
I'm going to talk about looking at data,
that is graphing your data.

3
00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:16,730
It's always important when you get a new
data set,

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,480
to graph each of your variables
individually.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,948
When you do that, there's a lot of things
that you can pick up from the graph.

6
00:00:22,948 --> 00:00:25,570
So you all, want to always plot your data.

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,250
And what you're looking for are things
like if you do a, a frequency plot of

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,990
your variables, that what we're going to
talk about in this module.

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,420
You can immediately pick up things like,
are there outliers?

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,730
And outliers are just extreme values, very
high or very low values that

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,630
maybe are outside of the range that's
expected, for your particular population.

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,110
Outliers, by the way,

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,530
are not necessarily data errors, and we're
not going to just throw them out.

14
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,430
But I always get students coming to me and
saying, oh, you know,

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,490
can I call this an outlier and can I throw
it out of my data set?

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,730
We're certainly not going to throw
outliers out.

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,390
But it's important that we know that
they're in there when we're

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,140
doing a data analysis.

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,040
Because they can be very influential on
some of the statistics,

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,282
as we'll see later this week.

21
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:11,450
The other things that you can pick up off
of a graphic,

22
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,140
are data points that just don't make
sense.

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,520
These are usually data entry errors.

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,800
So if the data were entered manually, it's
very easy for

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,980
a data entry error to be introduced.

26
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,450
Most data sets that are entered manually
will have some of these.

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,480
You want to pick those up as early as you
can, in the data analysis process.

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,070
Finally, you want to plot your variable,
so

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,160
that you can see how the data are
distributed.

30
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,610
What's the shape of the distribution?

31
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,240
Where's the center?

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,220
What's the variation?

33
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,980
So you can get a good feel for your
variables.

34
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,470
Just to illustrate the importance of
graphing and

35
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,710
how easy it is to pick up some of these
things from the graphic.

36
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,390
I had a variable in my data set on my
Stanford students, where I

37
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,840
asked them to report how many servings of
fruit and vegetables they eat every day.

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,300
So I went into the data set and made one
data entry error.

39
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,870
I took one of the values, where someone
said that they eat ten servings and

40
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,340
I added a 0.

41
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,560
Just for illustration here.

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,130
And you can see that it would be very
easy, and when somebody's entering

43
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,910
data for something like this to happen, is
0 to be added or left out.

44
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,990
You can see how easy it is to pick up this
mistake on the graph.

45
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,410
Right?
it's immediately obvious that that

46
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,970
point doesn't make sense.

47
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,620
You can't have people eating 100 fruits
and vegetables a day.

48
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,190
So you would pick that error up
immediately, and

49
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,360
be able to resolve it right away.

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,984
But the thing you're looking for

51
00:02:24,984 --> 00:02:28,812
when you're graphing the data, is just to
describe how the data are distributed.

52
00:02:28,812 --> 00:02:32,118
So, for categorical data's, you want to
pick up information like, what

53
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:35,830
are the n's, the sam, numbers and percents
in each of the different categories?

54
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,136
And for quantitative data, you're going to
be asking questions like,

55
00:02:39,136 --> 00:02:40,992
what's the shape of the distribution?

56
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:43,834
Do I have a bell curve, eh, a bell curve
or skewed distribution?

57
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:47,314
Those are some of the different things we
are going to be talking about in

58
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:47,970
this module.

59
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,890
Where's the center of the data?

60
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,680
What's the spread or variability of the
data?

61
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,150
The frequency plots that I'm going to be
showing you.

62
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,680
These are for plotting one variable at a
time.

63
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,080
For categorical variables, I'm going to
show you a bar chart.

64
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,750
Most of you are probably familiar with a
bar chart,

65
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,010
they're fairly easy to interpret and make.

66
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,330
For continuous or

67
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,410
quantitative variables, I'm going to show
you about two types of plots.

68
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,002
There's something called a box plot and
something called a histogram.

69
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:11,780
And I love histograms.

70
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,315
You're going to be seeing tons and tons of
histograms in this course.

71
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:18,730
So it's important that you pay attention
in this module, so

72
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,260
you really understand what's going on in a
histogram.

73
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,480
You'll probably be dreaming in histograms
by the end of this course.

74
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,280
So first of all, a bar chart is used for
categorical variables.

75
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,570
Again, it shows the frequency, that is the
count, or

76
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,210
proportion of observations in each of the
categories.

77
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,980
For example, I asked the students in my
Stanford data set,

78
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,736
did they play varsity sports in high
school?

79
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:41,960
30 said yes, 20 said no,

80
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,840
and that's very simple information to pick
up off the bar chart.

81
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,580
Also, I created a categorical variable for
coffee drinking,

82
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,195
I divided people into none, light,
moderate, and heavy coffee drinking.

83
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:57,660
And you can see the frequency counts shown
in a bar chart here,

84
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,940
the way that I divided the categories I
ended up with,

85
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,230
fairly even numbers in all of those
categories.

86
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,770
Again, very easy to look at and interpret
a bar chart.

87
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,240
For quantitative variables, we're often
going to use a box plot or a histogram.

88
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,730
And again this is to show the shape,
center and

89
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,690
range of variation of that quantitative
variable.

90
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,750
So, we're going to start with a box plot
here.

91
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,520
So, here's the box plot for exercise.

92
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,950
I asked the students to report how many
hours of moderate to

93
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,910
intense exercise that they do every week.

94
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,990
And you can see that my Stanford students
were doing pretty well on exercise.

95
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,570
Most of them are getting a, a decent
amount of exercise weekly.

96
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,290
The way that you interpret this box plot.

97
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,620
So, first of all, the box is the middle
50% of the data.

98
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,980
So if you were to arrange the students
from the lowest exercise per week to

99
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,990
the highest.

100
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,810
That would represent,

101
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,250
the box would be the, those who are right
in the middle 50%.

102
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,700
That is, from the 25th percentile to the
75th percentile.

103
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,520
So the 25th percentile here is 2, the 75th
percentile is 6.

104
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,097
So that means that 25% of my students were
doing less than two hours of exercise per

105
00:05:02,097 --> 00:05:05,880
week, 25%, a quarter of my students were
doing more than six hours per week.

106
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,090
The middle 50% was between 2 and 6.

107
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,620
The line in the box represents the median,
that's the 50th percentile.

108
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,290
It means that 50% of my students were
exercising more than 3 and

109
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,265
a quarter hours per week.

110
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:22,520
50% of my students were exercising less
than 3 and a quarter hours a week.

111
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,010
The distance from the bottom of the box to
the top of the box,

112
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,370
from the 25th percentile to the 75th
percentile.

113
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,140
That's called the interquartile range, or
sometimes we abbreviate that as IQR.

114
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,970
So I'm just going to subtract 6 minus 2 in
this case.

115
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,253
And we see that the interquartile range is
4.

116
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:44,190
The middle 50% of my data, the spread of
that is 4.

117
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,940
So that parts actually fairly
straightforward.

118
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,380
The box is fairly straightforward.

119
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,700
It gets a little more tricky when we talk
about the whiskers.

120
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,000
So I'm going to start with the top
whisker.

121
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,390
The top whisker can be one of two things.

122
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,270
It's either the maximum value.

123
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,600
Or it's this other quantity, which is the
75th percentile, or

124
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,930
q3 plus 1.5 times the interquartile range.

125
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,210
I'll calculate what out, out what that is
in, in just a second here.

126
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,440
But you're going to pick out of those two.

127
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,630
For the top whisker, you're going to pick
whichever of those is lower.

128
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,310
If the maximum is lower, you put the
whisker at, at the maximum.

129
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,400
If the other, if the q3 time, plus 1.5
times the interquartile range is lower,

130
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,520
you're going to put the whisker there.

131
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,310
So let me just calculate what that is
here.

132
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,804
So again, the interquartile range is 4, so

133
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:33,390
1.5 times the interquartile range of 4
gives you a value of 6.

134
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,020
And what we are doing here with this value
of 6,

135
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,186
is we're saying that if you are more than
6 below the 25th percentile, or more than

136
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:46,430
6 above the 75th percentile, you're kind
of outside the expected range for

137
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,540
this population, and we're going to call
you an outlier.

138
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,170
There actually are no outliers in
exercise.

139
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:51,990
We're going to see in the,

140
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,550
in another variable, we're going to see
some outliers.

141
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,923
So in this case the third quartile, the
75% percentile accrued at 6 hours, the 1.5

142
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:06,060
times the interquartile range is also 6,
so this boundary, this value here is 12.

143
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,070
It turns out though, that actually the
maximum value was also 12 here.

144
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,910
So those are equal in this case, there was
a student who exercised 12 hours per week.

145
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,520
Since both of those are equal to 12,

146
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,452
obviously we're going to put this upper
whisker at 12.

147
00:07:18,452 --> 00:07:22,920
For the lower whisker the, lower whisker
will occur at whatever is higher out of

148
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,910
the minimum value,

149
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,320
or, the 25th percentile minus 1.5 times
interquartile range.

150
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,790
You're going to pick the higher of those
two, and put the lower whisker there.

151
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:42,260
So in this case the 25th percentile occurs
at 2 minus 6 is equal to negative 4.

152
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,130
So this boundary would occur at negative
4,

153
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,130
but of course, you can't have negative 4
hours of exercise per week.

154
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,280
So this whisker will occur at the minimum,
which is 0, there are some students who

155
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,150
didn't do any exercise per week, so we put
the whisker at the minimum.

156
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,682
So, in this case, with this boxplot of
exercise,

157
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:02,850
the whiskers just represent the minimum
and maximum values.

158
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,990
We're going to see in the next slide,

159
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,950
that sometimes the whiskers represent this
other quantity.

160
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,130
So I also asked my students to report for

161
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,905
me, how they rated themselves on their
political leanings.

162
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:21,780
And I had a scale that was anywhere from
zero where zero's the most conservative,

163
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,590
up to 100 where 100 is the most liberal.

164
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,200
And I asked my students to rate themselves
on that scale.

165
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,070
You can see by looking at the boxplot that
the majority of

166
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,840
Stanford students cluster in the liberal
range, in the democratic range.

167
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:42,020
And if we just narrow, zero in on the box
here, the 75th percentile occurred at 85.

168
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,520
The 25th percentile occurred at 68.

169
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,212
So, that means the middle 50% of my
students range between a value of

170
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:53,120
68 to 85, so that's very much in the
liberal, Democratic range.

171
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,160
The median occurred at 78, so half of my
students rated themselves higher than

172
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,536
a 78, half rated themselves lower than a
78.

173
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:04,702
The interquartile range is just the
distance from the 25th to

174
00:09:04,702 --> 00:09:09,270
the 75th percentile, so that's 85 minus
68, or a value of 17.

175
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,590
So actually, my, that's a fairly narrow
range here.

176
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,970
My students are really clustered up in
that, liberal, range of values.

177
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,070
Now, in terms of the whiskers here,

178
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:23,430
the upper whisker occurs at the maximum
possible value of a 100.

179
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,330
So one of my students said that they were
a 100, as liberal as it comes, and so

180
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,940
I'm going to put the whisker there.

181
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:34,249
If I were to calculate the 3rd quartile
plus 1.5 times the interquartile range,

182
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:36,699
that's 85 plus 1.5 times 17.

183
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:38,920
Obviously that's going to be higher than a
100.

184
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,070
So the maximum is the lower of those two
values,

185
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,120
we're going to put the whisker there,
there's nobody who falls outside,

186
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,932
of that 1.5 times the interquartile range
boundary.

187
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:50,955
For the lower whisker however, notice it's
different.

188
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:54,810
Because the, the lower whisker here is not
at the minimum value.

189
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,733
So, if you calculate the 25th percentile
minus this 1.5 times

190
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:06,441
the interquartile range, you get 68 minus
1.5 times 17, that's a value of 42.5.

191
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:10,193
So, we're going to put the whisker at
42.5, because that's higher than

192
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:15,149
the minimum value, the minimum value
actually occurred at 27.

193
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:19,177
So what this is saying is that, given the
rest of the people in

194
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:26,364
in this sample anything below 42.5 is kind
of unexpected for this data set.

195
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:27,680
These people, if you're outside,

196
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,799
you're outside the expected range if
you're lower than 42.5.

197
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,639
We're going to call those people who fall
in that range, lower than 42.5,

198
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,687
we're going to call them outliers, and

199
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:42,386
we're going to represent each person who
is an outlier with a dot.

200
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:45,857
Now, what do these outliers actually mean?

201
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:47,691
There's four people here.

202
00:10:47,691 --> 00:10:50,060
Again, the lowest occurred at 27.

203
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,475
So what do those outliers mean?

204
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:54,607
That doesn't mean that those are not data
errors,

205
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:56,968
there's not problems with the data.

206
00:10:56,968 --> 00:11:00,590
Those are real people and though, that's
probably really their political bent.

207
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,140
So these again are not errors,

208
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:07,315
it's just that most of Stanford's students
are more in the liberal range.

209
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:12,700
So anybody who's at 27, 30, and even the
low 40s,

210
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,240
is outside of what's expected for Stanford
students.

211
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,470
Again we're not going to throw them out.

212
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,350
Those are real data.

213
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,390
Those are real, there are really Stanford
students who are Republican.

214
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,720
And clearly they may be outliers for this
particular population.

215
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,900
But if you went elsewhere in the country,
say you went to you know,

216
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,840
to the midwest of the US, it fact,

217
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,580
it might turn out that, that range is
quite common out there.

218
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,842
And, so people that had values of 27, 30,

219
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:41,760
40 may not at all be outliers in a
different population.

220
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,960
But, again, it's important we know that
those outliers are there.

221
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,170
Because they can have a lot of influence,

222
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,735
a lot of sway on certain statistics, as
we're going to see this week.

223
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:54,050
So that's the, the boxplot.

224
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,690
Now, I'm going to show you the histogram.

225
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,830
So I took that same variable exercise, and
I put it into a histogram.

226
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,650
So a histogram, the way you build a
histogram, is you take the,

227
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,840
the range of values.

228
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,630
So in this case, you know,

229
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,540
exercise range from 0 to 12, and you
divide it up in to equal intervals.

230
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,710
So in this case I've made, we call those
bins.

231
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,630
I've made bins of two hours per week.

232
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,688
So I've divided up exercise into zero.

233
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:19,850
To two, two to four, four to six, six to
eight, eight to 10, 10 to 12, 12 to 14.

234
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:24,070
And then what this graph shows you

235
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,240
is what percent of my observations falls
within each of those bins.

236
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,425
So the Y axis here is a percentage.

237
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:34,560
It's the percent of observations that
occur within each of those bin.

238
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,270
And you can see by looking at this graph,
it's immediately obvious that

239
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,672
most of my students, the biggest number of
students fall between two and

240
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:44,930
four hours of exercise per week.

241
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,284
So it's just a really nice graphic,

242
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:48,754
because you can immediately see kind of
where everybody lies.

243
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:52,090
Let me go into a little bit more detail
about how to read this graph.

244
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,340
So again the Y axis is a percentage.

245
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,725
So you would scroll across for example for
this lowest bin, the zero to two bin.

246
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,800
If I scroll across to the Y axis,

247
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,590
I see that intersects the Y axis at 12%,
the height of that bin.

248
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,600
The height of that bar is 12%.

249
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,670
So that means 12% of my students, and

250
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,320
remember I had 50 students so 12% is equal
to a count of six.

251
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,290
So 12% or six of my students exercised
between zero and two hours per week.

252
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,990
And in fact it's actually between Zero and
just up to two, but not including two.

253
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,420
It happens to be that this statistical
program,

254
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,410
the higher value in the bin, is not
included in that bin.

255
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,310
So, it's going to be zero all the way up
to but not including two,

256
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,810
two is going to be anybody who is exactly
two, will be included in the next bin.

257
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,950
So you just have to know that about the
way that this particular program

258
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,540
groups things.

259
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,130
So you read the next bin which has
obviously the highest.

260
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,326
That bar has the highest height as 42% so
that's 21 students.

261
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:56,518
42% of my students exercise somewhere
between two and just up to but

262
00:13:56,518 --> 00:13:58,982
not including four hours per week.

263
00:13:58,982 --> 00:14:01,210
And you can read across all the bars in
the same way.

264
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,530
I'll just read the very last one here for
you.

265
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,990
So it turns out that there was one
student, 2%,

266
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,400
who exercised exactly 12 hours per week.

267
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,310
That person got included in the 12 to 14
bin,

268
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,028
because again, the 10 to 12 bin does not
include 12.

269
00:14:16,028 --> 00:14:20,990
So 12 to 14 is the bin that actually
includes exactly 12 hours per week, so

270
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,520
there, that represents one student who
exercised 12 hours per week.

271
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,340
Now again you can, there's just so

272
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,970
much information that you can pick up
visually here.

273
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,300
So notice that this distribution,

274
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,880
the shape has what we call a right tail or
a right skew.

275
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,050
All this means is that you know,

276
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,750
most people exercise a couple of hours per
week, but there's a few people who

277
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,680
are really heavy exercisers and they fall
form a tail out to the right.

278
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,140
A couple of high values out to the right,
so

279
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,166
we call this a right skew or a right tail.

280
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:56,130
I just want to show you what happens if I
change the bin sizes.

281
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,550
So what if I were to set the bin size to
be really small like 0.2 hours per week?

282
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,440
You can see that this graph is not as
visually appealing.

283
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,940
It's harder to pick up the pattern from
looking at this graph.

284
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,070
So this graph really just has too much
detail.

285
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,530
If you make the bins too small, you end up
with too much detail, it's not as helpful.

286
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,210
Similarly if you make the bins too big,

287
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,345
lets say I set them to be eight hours per
week each.

288
00:15:18,345 --> 00:15:21,730
Again in this case there's too little
detail, and

289
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,040
you're not able to pick up all the
important details from, from this graphic.

290
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,182
So it's a little bit of an art selecting
the right bin size.

291
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:32,710
I, it turns out that most standard
statistical programs have

292
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,070
an algorithm that will choose the bin size
for you.

293
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,860
if you if you don't want to choose it
yourself.

294
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,480
Or you can control that bin size yourself,

295
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,200
to get just the right amount of detail in
there.

296
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,700
[SOUND].

297
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,480
So those are the histograms for exercise.

298
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,370
Let me now show you the histogram for
political bent.

299
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,850
So, again, as we saw with the boxplot.

300
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,690
You had a lot of students clustering in
the liberal democratic range.

301
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,550
That is in between 50 and 100.

302
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,490
And, you can see that this, the shape of
this distribution,

303
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,430
we could say it has a little bit of a left
skew or a left tail,

304
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,020
that is most people are in the 70, 80, 90
range.

305
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,270
But we have a few lower values out to the
left, so

306
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,040
you might describe that as having a left
skew.

307
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,900
You could also describe this distribution
as being bimodal.

308
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,400
That means it has two peaks, or two
groups.

309
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,590
And that's actually pretty informative to
see it that way.

310
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,670
Because what's going on here, is that I
really do have two types of students,

311
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,210
two groups of students in terms of
politics.

312
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,555
I have a large group of Democrats at
Stanford.

313
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:39,540
And you can see that within that group of
Democrats,

314
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,630
if you just look at the distribution of
political readings within my Democrats,

315
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,696
those those ratings actually follow a
pretty nice bell curve.

316
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:52,369
So what that says is, Democrats at

317
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:56,370
Stanford hover around a liberal rating of
sort 80 that's kind of a mean.

318
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,060
But we have some who are more in the 60 or
70.

319
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,320
That's a left tail.

320
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,430
Some who are over in the 90 or 100, that's
a right tail.

321
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,750
So it actually follows a pretty nice bell
curve.

322
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,990
So that represents my Democrats at
Stanford.

323
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,250
But then we also have a second group,
that's much smaller but it does exist.

324
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,230
We have a second group at Stanford
students who are Republicans, we have a,

325
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,410
a number you know a population of students
who are Republicans.

326
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,080
Interestingly, this the,

327
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,630
the political rating within the
Republicans also follows a normal curve.

328
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,590
And it's centered around 40, so

329
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,190
you can see that the Republican group at
Stanford is not highly conservative.

330
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,840
Right?
40 is actually quite close to 50?

331
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,930
So they're a little bit in the
conservative Republican range, but

332
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,030
they're hovering around 40, which is a
rather high in that range.

333
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,630
And then we've got some, who out in the
30s, and down to the high 20s,

334
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,240
and some that are up to, you know, high
40s, and low 50s.

335
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,720
So, again though, it's interesting to see
that there's really two groups here.
