[BLANK_AUDIO].
In this next module,

2
00:00:08,497 --> 00:00:12,017
I'm going to introduce you to survival
analysis and tell you about

3
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:18,155
the statistics that are used to compare
time-to-event outcomes between groups.

4
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:21,963
We talked about time-to-event variables at
the very first week of this course, so

5
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:25,995
a time-to-event variable is something that
you can collect only in a randomized trial

6
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:31,495
or a cohort study where you're actually
following people over time.

7
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:32,870
It's a hybrid variable.

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,160
You're measuring the amount of time that
they contribute to the study before they

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,590
have the event, or until the study ends,
or until they drop out of the study.

10
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,170
As well as you're recording whether or

11
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,080
not they actually have the event, because
not everybody will have the event.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,240
This might be something like time to
death, or time to heart attack, or

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,725
time to chronic kidney disease.

14
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:54,980
People who don't have the event are said
to be censored.

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,640
And that is recorded as well as the amount
of time that they contribute.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,600
So, the time-to-event variable has a time
part.

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,470
That's the time from when enter the study
until you have an outcome, or

18
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,990
you're censored, meaning you leave the
study without having the outcome.

19
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,270
The binary part of the time-to-event
variable is just whether or

20
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,610
not the subject had the event.

21
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,080
And again, subjects who don't have the
event are said to be censored.

22
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,410
For time-to-event outcome survival
analysis, there's a couple of

23
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,870
different statistics we're going to be
talking about in this course.

24
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,190
So, I mentioned already in week two of the
course, we talked about the rate ratio.

25
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,230
I'm not going to go over that again here,
I'll refer you to week two.

26
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,950
This week I'm going to talk about
Kaplan-Meier statistics that's

27
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:42,170
the unadjusted way of comparing survival
experiences between two or more groups.

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,840
In a couple of weeks we'll talk about Cox
regression which is the multivariate

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,230
regression technique that's commonly used
for survival analysis.

30
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,310
What is survival analysis?

31
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,050
Again, it's the statistical methods for
analyzing time to event data.

32
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,200
They get a special name because they are,
they're a set of methods.

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,140
They combinate data from randomized trials
or cohort study designs.

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,640
Again, you have to be following people
over time to collect this type of data.

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,750
Here's an early example of a survival
analysis going back to 1669.

36
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,950
This was a curve, that, someone drew,

37
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,740
showing how many out of a 100 people
survive until 86 years of age.

38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,510
So the way to read this curve is we are
starting at an age of zero,

39
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:27,550
this is a 100 people born in 1669.

40
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,210
Notice that this, this is survival on the
y axis.

41
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:38,230
This, this is the percent of people
surviving out of 100.

42
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:43,060
So it starts at 100%, everybody's born and
then there's a rapid drop off of survival.

43
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:50,090
So notice that at this is at about 10
years old here, only 64% are surviving.

44
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,840
There was a lot of infant mortality back
in the 1600s.

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,400
You get down to about 16 years of age
there's only 40% surviving.

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,500
You get down to you know, 20 years of age,
there's only a third of people surviving.

47
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,660
And you get down to 36 years of age.

48
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,080
Only one in six, 16% of people are still
alive.

49
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,460
So if we all lived in the 1600s most of us
would be dead by now.

50
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,830
So it's a really good thing that we live
now and we have modern medicine.

51
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,190
Modern medicine has really,

52
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,960
really drastically improved survival
compared to this.

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,680
And this is just a few centuries ago.

54
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,950
But this is an example of survival
analysis.

55
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,770
What we're trying to do.

56
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,950
The goal in survival analysis is to figure
out this survival curve.

57
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,480
We start at 100% and drop off from there.

58
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,080
We're going to draw some curves today
called Kaplan-Meier curves.

59
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,559
And essentially that's what we're trying
to do.

60
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:46,370
We're trying to, to define what percent of
people are surviving.

61
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,240
Surviving is going to be used loosely
because we're

62
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,370
not always going to be talking about the
event of death.

63
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,020
We might be talking about other types of
events besides death.

64
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,950
But this was developed, these methods were
developed around.

65
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,040
Death, around survival.

66
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,820
And there's all sorts of things we can ask
about this curve like what's the shape of

67
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,468
this function?

68
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:06,006
This is sort of an exponential curve
you're seeing here.

69
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:09,300
We can define the curve based on what's
the chance a person survived past

70
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,758
a certain age, past 20, past 36?

71
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:14,484
When we talk about the Kaplan-Meier curve,
that's essentially what we're doing.

72
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:20,450
We're saying how many people survive event
free, past certain, time points.

73
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,254
And this is survial analysis.

74
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:23,172
We're trying to estimate this curve.

75
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:26,396
We're going to do what's called a
non-parametric estimate of this curve.

76
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,363
An emprical estimate of this curve.

77
00:04:28,363 --> 00:04:32,247
That's a Kaplan-Meier curve in just a
minute.

78
00:04:32,247 --> 00:04:35,651
Again, this doesn't have to be time until
death.

79
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:40,179
It can be time until any event that you
want, any binary event.
