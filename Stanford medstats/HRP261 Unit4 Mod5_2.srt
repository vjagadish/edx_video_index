1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,550
In this next module, we're going to talk
about the concept of interaction.

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,350
I mentioned it briefly in an earlier week
in this course.

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,710
But now we're going to really delve into
the concept.

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,169
And I'm going to show you how to test for
interaction in a regression model.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,480
First of all, what is interaction?

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,170
Interaction is when the effect size
differs significantly between

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,390
different subgroups.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,500
In other words, the relationship between a
treatment and

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,350
an outcome might differ depending on say,

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:37,320
whether you're a man or a woman or some
other subgroup characteristic.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,330
For example, if you've got a blood
pressure treatment that

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,060
works significantly better in men than in
women, that's interaction.

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,770
That would mean that the effect size for

14
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,770
the blood pressure treatment was
significantly bigger in men than in women.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,380
Another term you'll sometimes heard used
is effect modification.

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,320
Effect modification and interaction mean
the same thing.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,840
You could say that the effect of the blood
pressure treatment

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,290
was modified by gender or you could say
that the treatment and gender interact.

19
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,910
Either one is fine.

20
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,220
How do we test for interaction in a
regression model?

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,390
So to test for interaction in a regression
model,

22
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,930
you can add an interaction term to that
model.

23
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,490
And I'll show you what that is in a
minute.

24
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,050
If that interaction term is statistically
significant,

25
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,810
that indicates, that's proof of
interaction.

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,340
Let's use this little blood pressure
example.

27
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:36,030
If I want to test for interaction between
gender and this blood pressure treatment.

28
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,340
Blood pressure is a continuous outcome
variable.

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,360
So I'm going to be running a linear
regression here.

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,480
I'm going to include in my model, a beta
for treatment, and a beta for gender.

31
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,360
And I'm also going to include a term for
the interaction between gender and

32
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,670
treatment, and what that is,

33
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,630
is it's literally, I'm going to multiply
the value for gender times the value for

34
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,280
treatment, so let me illustrate that by
writing out a little mock data set.

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,710
You've got some variable gender,

36
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,810
in this case I've coded it that one is
male and zero is female.

37
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,065
I've got another variable that's
treatment, one means you're on the drug,

38
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,840
zero means you're on placebo.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,431
Then I've got ID numbers, let's call them
one,two and three, so

40
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:20,211
let's say the first person here was a male
and they were on the placebo,

41
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:24,140
they will get the values one for gender,
zero for treatment.

42
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,140
Then we've got a female who was on the
treatment, that would be a zero, one.

43
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,560
And then let's say we have a male who's on
the treatment, that's a one, one.

44
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,310
If you multiply those values together,
that is what an interaction is,

45
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,485
it's gender times treatment,

46
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:40,120
it's literally we're going to multiply the
values of those two variables together.

47
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,020
So ID number one gets a value of one times
a value of zero.

48
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,880
That's going to give them an interaction
term of zero.

49
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,240
The ID number two, gender is zero,
treatment is one, 0 times 1 is 0.

50
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,730
ID number three, 1 times 1 is 1.

51
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,698
Notice that if you've got two binary
predictors, a zero one variable and

52
00:02:58,698 --> 00:03:00,270
another zero one variable.

53
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,340
The only people who are going to get a one
for

54
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,710
the interaction are the people who have a
one on both of those binary variables.

55
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,450
So in this case,

56
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,480
only people who both are male and got the
drug will get a value of 1.

57
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,540
Everybody else gets a value of 0 for that
interaction.

58
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,350
That's the, the data, the variables that
we're then including in the model.

59
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,570
If the beta for the interaction comes out
to be statistically significant.

60
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,170
This would indicate that there is a
significant interaction And

61
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,460
the way you would interpret the betas from
the model, the beta for

62
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,100
treatment in this case, because women is
the reference group, the beta for

63
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,790
treatment represents the treatment effect
in the women.

64
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,170
The beta, the treatment effect for the
men, you get by adding the treatment

65
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:53,130
effect, the beta for treatment plus the
beta for interaction.

66
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,940
So men, their treatment effect is beta
treatment plus beta interaction.

67
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,960
In other words, the interaction term
represents the difference in

68
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,510
the treatment effect between the men and
the women.

69
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,190
So if that's significantly different,

70
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,930
that indicates a significant difference in
those effect sizes.

71
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,010
Just in, as a side note here.

72
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,850
There is also a beta gender here.

73
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,240
This term would just indicate whether or
not there was a main effect for gender.

74
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,830
That is whether or

75
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,329
not males have higher blood pressure than
females, unrelated to the treatment.

76
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,210
So that's what a model with an interaction
term looks like.

77
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,950
Now let's visit some real examples of how
to apply this in the medical literature.

78
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,060
In this trial we had women smokers who
were concerned about their weight.

79
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,440
They were afraid to quit because they were
afraid of gaining weight.

80
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,980
These women were randomly assigned to one
of four groups, so

81
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,670
they were randomly assigned to either get
weight-focused counseling or

82
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,060
to get standard counseling and they were
randomly assigned to get a drug,

83
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,750
an anti-smoking drug, bupropion or to get
a placebo.

84
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,670
So that makes up four total groups.

85
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,740
The outcome here was smoking abstinence.

86
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,330
It was biochemically confirmed.

87
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,830
It's a binary outcome.

88
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,460
You either were abstinent or you weren't.

89
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,899
So that means we're going to be using
logistic regression to analyze the data.

90
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,400
Here's the results of that study.

91
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,420
It's a rather busy table, so I'm going to
zoom in on some things now.

92
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,200
First of all, we're looking at actually
three different outcomes here.

93
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,300
They measured the abstinence rates at
three months, six months, and

94
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,360
12 months into the study.

95
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,330
So each of those rows represent a
different time point in the study.

96
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,660
If you just look at the placebo groups
within each of those counseling groups.

97
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,840
You'll see that the rates of abstinence
are pretty similar.

98
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,150
So at three months it was 18%, were at,
were in the placebo group.

99
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,037
In the weight-focused counseling group,

100
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:52,630
were abstinent versus 19% in the placebo
group in the other counseling group.

101
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,600
Those rates look very similar to what we
would say here is that there

102
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,940
doesn't appear to be a main effect for
counseling.

103
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,880
In the placebo groups,

104
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,500
those quitting rates in the two counseling
groups looked pretty much the same.

105
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,620
What about an effect for a drug?

106
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,400
So if we compare the placebo group to the
drug group within each of

107
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,450
those two counseling types, what do we
see?

108
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,690
It appears that the drug actually does
improve quitting rates in both groups.

109
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,270
So if I look at the weight-focused
counseling group,

110
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,540
if you were in the placebo group,

111
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,570
the quitting rate was 18% at three months,
versus in the drug group, and it was 41%.

112
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,360
At six months, you also see a similar, a
pretty big increase.

113
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,630
In the standard counseling group, the drug
also appears to have an effect.

114
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,550
At, the effect isn't quite as big, but

115
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,590
you do see almost a doubling of the
quitting rates if you add the drug.

116
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,655
So, for example, in the placebo group,

117
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:53,290
at three months, the quitting rate was
19%, then went to 33% in the drug group.

118
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,900
At six months, it went from 10% to 21%,

119
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,660
so there's a pretty big increase basically
a doubling of

120
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,800
quitting rates in the drug group even
within the standard counseling group.

121
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,950
Now as we talked about in the earlier
module on this example,

122
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,220
the P-value's highly significant for the
weight-focused counseling group,

123
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,610
the P-value comparing placebo and drug
within that group.

124
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,510
It didn't quite make statistical
significance.

125
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,220
It, within the standard counseling group.

126
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,540
But it's very close to that.

127
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,000
What we would conclude is there just
appears to be a main effect for drug.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,790
Overall, drug seems to be doing something.

129
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,720
Even though it didn't quite reach
statistical significance in the standard

130
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,300
counseling group.

131
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,020
We talked about not misinterpreting those
P-values in an earlier module.

132
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,820
If you look at the, what the authors
concluded in the media coverage of

133
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,800
this study, here's the basically
conclusion that was drawn.

134
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,350
Among weight-concerned women smokers, drug
therapy increases cessation rates

135
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,010
when added to a specialized weight
concerns intervention,

136
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,890
the weight counseling, but not when added
to standard counseling.

137
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,470
The implication there is that there is an
interaction.

138
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,730
They're saying that the drug works in one
group but not the other.

139
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,650
They're implying that there is an
interaction between drug and

140
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,320
counseling type.

141
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:13,120
However, they haven't done any formal
analyses to test for an interaction here.

142
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,720
So there is, they haven't specifically
talked about interaction, but

143
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,120
that's really the implication here.

144
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,840
And they haven't formally tested that.

145
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,610
So I actually took the data in their paper
and ran it in a logistic regression to

146
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,730
test for interaction, to see whether or
not there really is an interaction.

147
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,200
And what would it mean if there was an
interaction?

148
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,620
So just go back to this slide for a
minute.

149
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,630
An interaction would mean that the drug
effect, the difference between, you know,

150
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,490
going from here to here, the difference
between placebo and drug was much bigger

151
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,460
in the weight-focused counseling group
than in the standard counseling group.

152
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,500
It does appear to be somewhat bigger.

153
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,710
That the change from placebo to,

154
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,350
to drug, appears to be somewhat bigger in
the weight-focused counseling group, but

155
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,360
not a lot bigger than in the standard
counseling group.

156
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,890
We can formally test whether or not that
effect size is bigger.

157
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,460
We can run a logistic regression with an
interaction term.

158
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,480
Here's the logistic regression model
[INAUDIBLE].

159
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,850
Outcome is smoking abstinence.

160
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,370
I'm going to put in the model a main
effect for drug, a main effect for

161
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,080
counseling type, and an interaction
between drug and counseling type, and

162
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,110
these are all binary variables.

163
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,610
When I run that model using the data that
was available in the paper,

164
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,210
I find a significant effect for drug.

165
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,670
There's a significant main effect for
drug.

166
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,840
I find nothing for counseling effect.

167
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,030
The counseling, the beta for

168
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,550
counseling does not come out statistically
significant.

169
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,650
And the interaction between drug and
counseling type also does

170
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,620
not come out to be anywhere near
statistically significant.

171
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,630
Indicating that we can't say that there's
a difference in how that

172
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,770
drug works in those two groups.

173
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:49,570
And here I'm just showing you the P-values
for interaction from those models I ran.

174
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,890
I ran three logistic regression models for
each of the time points.

175
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,160
And in none of the cases Does the P-value
even approach statistical significance, so

176
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,770
we have no evidence that the effect of the
drug differs by counseling type.

177
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,350
Our main conclusion then, our correct
take-home message would be that the drug

178
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,930
improves quitting rates over counseling
alone, period.

179
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,580
There's a main effect for drug.

180
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,170
There's no main effect for counseling
type, and

181
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,610
there's no interaction between drug and
counseling type.

182
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,770
It's not statistically significant at
least, so we don't have evidence

183
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,760
that the drug behaves differently in those
two groups, at least not from this study.

184
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,860
The second example I'm going to show you
is a cross sectional study of

185
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,730
about 1700 men and women.

186
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,480
In this study, they actually did formally
test for

187
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,330
interaction and they actually did find a
significant interaction.

188
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,090
This study was looking at the relationship
between sleep duration and

189
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,080
sleep problems and hypertension.

190
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,000
It's a cross sectional study but

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,700
they treated hypertension as the outcome
variable.

192
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,662
Hypertension is binary, yes, no.

193
00:10:50,662 --> 00:10:53,720
So we're going to be using, they did use,
logistic regression.

194
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,290
Let me show you the main results of that
study,

195
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,050
this chart's a little complicated, so I'm
going to kind of walk you through it.

196
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,120
And I want to actually also write out the
logistic regression model that

197
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,930
was used here.

198
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,310
I think it's, it, it's a little
complicated but it's instructive.

199
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,630
So first of all, what are we looking at?

200
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,400
The outcome here is hypertension.

201
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,600
So we're looking at odds ratios for

202
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,620
hypertension based on two predictor
variables.

203
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,920
Sleep difficulty and sleep duration.

204
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,020
If you read the fine print, I just want to
note here,

205
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,240
that there's other things in the model
between, besides those two predictors.

206
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,633
It says all data were adjusted for age,
race, sex, BMI, et cetera, et cetera.

207
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:35,310
So, there's a whole bunch of other
variables in the model that I'm not even

208
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,730
going to bother to write out in the model
but they're,

209
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,480
those predictors are also included in the
model, just to adjust for confounding.

210
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,270
The predictors that the researchers cared
about here were two predictors,

211
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,970
sleep difficulty, which is a three level
categorical variable.

212
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,330
You were either a normal sleeper, that's
the reference group.

213
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,310
You had poor sleep, kind of not at the
level of insomnia, but some trouble.

214
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,880
And then you could have insomnia, which is
really troubled sleeping.

215
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,130
They also looked at a three category
variable for sleep duration.

216
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,720
So they categorized people as getting more
than six hours per night,

217
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,810
getting five to six hours per night, or
getting less than five hours per night.

218
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,450
The reference group is getting, is the
highest sleeping group,

219
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,810
more than six hours per night.

220
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,510
They ran a logistic regression model with
those two categorical variables as well as

221
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,300
the interactions.

222
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,848
So let me write out that model,

223
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:30,380
again we're modelling the log odds of
hypertension.

224
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,740
It's going to have an intercept.

225
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,635
And because we've got a multilevel
categorical variable,

226
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:39,550
we're going to be dummy coding, so this is
good review of dummy coding.

227
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,030
The reference group is normal sleepers.

228
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,790
To dummy code a three level categorical
variable I need two dummy coded variables.

229
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,690
So normal sleepers will will not get its
own beta but I'll have a beta for

230
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,140
poor sleep, and I'll have a beta for
insomnia.

231
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,380
If you have a zero, zero for poor sleep
and

232
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,940
a zero for insomnia you are by default in
the normal sleeping group.

233
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,280
For sleep duration, I'm going to put in,
the reference is greater than six hours,

234
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,268
so I'm going to put in the beta for

235
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:11,100
five to six hours, and I'm going to put in
the beta for less than five hours.

236
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,010
If you get a zero on both of those binary
dummy coded variables,

237
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,270
that means by default you're in the
greater than six hours duration group.

238
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,600
That's how I dummy code those two
predictors.

239
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,280
But now, the researchers also put it in an
interaction term between those

240
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,340
two predictors.

241
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,350
So let me show you what that looks like in
the model.

242
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,150
If we're interacting two three level
categorical variables,

243
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,759
we're going to end up with four
interaction terms in the model.

244
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,290
First of all, we're going to have an
interaction between poor sleep and

245
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,120
five to six hours duration per night.

246
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,966
We're going to have an interaction between
poor sleep and

247
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:45,481
less than five hours per night.

248
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,103
We're going to have an interaction term
for insomnia,

249
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:01,046
times the five to six hour duration, and
we're going to have an interaction for

250
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:02,260
insomnia and the less than five hour
duration.

251
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,350
Plus remember this model also has all
those other betas for

252
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,670
the confounders that I'm not going to
bother to write out.

253
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,320
So it's a little complicated, but

254
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,220
each of these interaction terms is either
a one if you are in that group.

255
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,240
So for example, the, the poor sleep times
five to six hours per week.

256
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,390
If you're in the poor sleep group and

257
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,940
you sleep five to six hours per night
you're going to get a one for

258
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,070
that interaction term, everybody else is
going to get a zero.

259
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,280
So this breaks down to a bunch of binary
variables.

260
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,410
From all of these betas,

261
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,590
by fitting all these betas you are able to
get an odds ratio for

262
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:39,060
each of these different categories of both
sleep duration and sleep difficulty.

263
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,610
That's what they generated here.

264
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:45,290
They generated those odds ratios right
from the logistic regression model.

265
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,720
If you look at the fine print, it says the
interaction between insomnia and

266
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,490
objective sleep duration is statistically
significant.

267
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,089
So two interaction terms came out
statistically significant, those that

268
00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:01,459
interacted insomnia, not poor sleep but
insomnia, with the short sleep duration.

269
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:04,120
And you can also see the interaction just
by

270
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,510
looking at the odds ratios that were
generated by the model here.

271
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,430
So if you look at the odds ratios again,
the reference group is normal sleepers who

272
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,450
are sleeping more than six hours per
night.

273
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,360
If you compare poor sleepers and
insomniacs who, where,

274
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,740
everybody is sleeping at least six hours
per night, long sleepers,

275
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,880
you'll notice that poor sleep and insomnia
didn't make much difference.

276
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,510
There the odds ratios are 0.79 and 1.31.

277
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,000
So you don't really get much increase in
your chances of

278
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,080
hypertension if you have bad sleep as long
as you're sleeping enough every night.

279
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,200
If you move over, however, to the group
who's sleeping much shorter,

280
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,460
five to six hours per night, then you'll
notice that normal sleepers and

281
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,780
poor sleep there wasn't too much going on.

282
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,350
But, those who have insomnia and

283
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:55,610
are also sleeping only five to six hours
per night have a 3.5 odds ratio there,

284
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:01,020
so a drastic increase in the odds of
hypertension.

285
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:09,120
finally, if you look at the really short
sleepers, the effect of insomnia is even

286
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,310
greater, so as you get up to the insomniac
group, and you're having really poor

287
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:19,440
sleep, you get a increase, a much bigger
increase in your odds of hypertension.

288
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,510
And notice that this odds ratio comes out
statistically significant.

289
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,530
So does this one.

290
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,870
So again, there, there's a significant
interaction here.

291
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,780
The sleeping difficulty doesn't seem to
matter as long as

292
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,570
you're getting enough sleep, but if you
are not getting enough sleep,

293
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,320
then the sleeping difficulty seems to
really impact your risk of hypertension.

294
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,500
That's what, that's what the interaction,

295
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,870
that's the sort of verbal way to describe
the interaction here.

296
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:52,230
I want to point out and remind you that we
are dealing with odds ratios here, and

297
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,880
as I told you, talked a lot about in week
two of this course,

298
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,990
odds ratios, you have to be careful about
interpreting them.

299
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,300
This was a cross-sectional study.

300
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,020
The outcome was extremely common.

301
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,290
In the reference group, about a quarter of
people in

302
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,430
the reference group had hypertension, so
the outcome is very common.

303
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,809
So you have to be careful about
interpreting,

304
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:15,761
these odds ratios look really big, 3.5 and
5.1.

305
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:17,835
You would not want to say that this was a,

306
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:22,105
that this 3.5 represented a three-fold
increase in the risk of hypertension in

307
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:25,948
this group, and you would not want to say
that this five, this odds ratio of

308
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:29,400
five represented a five-fold increase in
risk of hypertension.

309
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,400
Since the outcome is common these odds
ratios are distorted.

310
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,350
These are not the increases in risk.

311
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,390
They are the increases in odds.

312
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,640
If you use the little formula I gave you
in week one you could actually convert

313
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,640
back and figure out the risk ratios, the
corresponding risk ratios.

314
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,170
It turns out that there's more like a
doubling in the risk of hypertension here,

315
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,220
not a fivefold increase, so I don't want
you to forget.

316
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,890
When we're doing logistic regression and
you're getting odds ratios,

317
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,300
be careful about the interpretation when
you have a common outcome.

318
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,260
This final example actually comes from a
paper that

319
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,333
I wrote in graduate school and so excuse
the,

320
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:11,110
the poor resolution of the graphic it's a
little bit of an older paper.

321
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:16,270
But this involved a, an interaction term
that we found in a linear regression.

322
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,660
So just to show you how this works also
for linear regression.

323
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,200
We were looking at three outcomes.

324
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,990
This was looking at bone density so

325
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:28,650
we looked at the bone density in the spine
and in the hip, and overall in the body.

326
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,090
Those were the outcomes.

327
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,780
Since our outcomes are continuous, bone
density is continuous,

328
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,140
we were actually doing linear regression
here, not logistic regression.

329
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,700
Women athletes, this is a study about
women athletes, women runners.

330
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,270
Women athletes sometimes if they have
disordered eating And

331
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,690
irregularities in their menstrual cycle,
it can cause them to lose bone density.

332
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,830
That's what this paper was about.

333
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,200
So we were looking at kind of two factors
here.

334
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,510
We were looking at an eating disorder
score, called the EDI score.

335
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,630
This tells us about eating, disordered
eating behavior,

336
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,840
so higher scores is, women is more likely
to have some kind of eating disorder.

337
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,950
We also looked at menstrual cycle, and so
we divided women into two groups.

338
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,570
Those with the normal menstrual cycle,
those are the eumenorrheic women,

339
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,920
those are all the bars in the back of
these graphics, and

340
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,125
women with menstrual irregularities, we
call that the oligo and

341
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,018
amenorrheic group and that, those bars in
the front.

342
00:19:22,018 --> 00:19:27,250
So we looked at those two menstrual groups
as well as this disordered eating

343
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,140
score and we looked at the interaction
between those two things and

344
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,150
we did find a statistically significant
interaction here.

345
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,310
And it's kind of nicely pictured in these
graphics.

346
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,220
So what's happening here is that if you
look at

347
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,760
the women who already have menstrual
irregularities.

348
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,250
If you look at the effect of eating
disorder score, that doesn't seem that

349
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,540
their bone density changes much at all
across different eating disorder scores.

350
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,040
Once you already have menstrual
irregularities,

351
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,870
there doesn't seem to be much additional
effect of eating disorder score so

352
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,040
the bone density is pretty flat across
those different eating disorder

353
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,820
score groups.

354
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:06,700
If you look however at the women with
normal periods, the eumenorrheic group,

355
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,000
the bars in the back.

356
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,550
You can see there's a pretty dramatic
effect for eating disorder scores, so

357
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:14,510
as your eating disorder score increases,
your bone density goes down quite a bit.

358
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,226
That's in all three sites.

359
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:23,885
So interestingly, there's an interaction
here because the the effect

360
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:28,990
of the eating disorder score was different
between these two menstrual groups.

361
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,740
And that had some certain implications
that were of interest.

362
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,220
But we got this significant interaction in
a linear regression by

363
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,470
including the interaction between EDI
score and and menstrual group.
