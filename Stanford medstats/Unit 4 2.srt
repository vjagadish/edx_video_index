2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,760
Okay, now that you have some of the basic
tools under your belt,

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,710
let's talk a little bit about some of the
thought processing in terms of

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,320
conducting that root cause analysis.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,060
And it starts off with the concept of the
five why's.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:27,530
The 5 Whys is primarily geared to be able
to focus on drilling

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,840
down on those individual reasons why a
particular cause was to occur.

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,010
You ask, the thought is, is if you ask the
why five times you may be

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,410
able to drill down to the point where you
actually get to the heart of the issue.

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,835
So, let's take one situation here not an
uncommon scenario is,

11
00:00:47,835 --> 00:00:50,660
why did a patient get the wrong
medication.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,535
And the response that was obtained was
because the staff did not do

13
00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:58,641
the double-check, that is,

14
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:04,590
the double-check of the medication, the
identification of the patient.

15
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,820
Make sure the dosing is right, the route
is right the frequency is right.

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,070
You know, all those five rights, you know,

17
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,210
that needs to be done to make sure the
right patient gets the right medication.

18
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,640
Second why.

19
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,190
Why did the staff do not do the double
check?

20
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,820
Well, reason being because the computer
was not available to confirm the order.

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,990
Sounds reasonable.

22
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,370
There's a number of reasons why that
maybe, you know, it didn't happen.

23
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,921
But the fact is is that when you query the
staff about not doing the double check,

24
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:40,529
they'll give you an answer and in this
case, the computer was not available.

25
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,400
Why was the computer not available, you
ask?

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,140
Well, because many of the computers were
being charged up.

27
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,770
Starting to scratch your head a little bit
so,

28
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,150
we have all these computers, they're all
available, not being used or

29
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,690
not being able to be used because they're
being charged up, well why is that?

30
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,910
Well, because the batteries don't
necessarily seem to hold their charge.

31
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,583
Well, so, the computers, which we rely on,

32
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:12,804
as a core identify as tool to be able to
identify, who the patient is and

33
00:02:12,804 --> 00:02:17,226
make sure the order and medication rights
are not available, because of the,

34
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:21,550
batteries in these computers are not able
to hold the charge.

35
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,570
So, why is the batteries not holding the
charge?

36
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,650
Because the batteries were not being
maintained as scheduled.

37
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,246
You should probably know a lot of our
technology relies on battery and

38
00:02:30,246 --> 00:02:34,586
batteries also have maintenance issues,
maintenance concerns that needs to

39
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:38,182
be addressed as well as any other
electrical devices and as a result,

40
00:02:38,182 --> 00:02:42,810
in this situation, the batteries are not
being maintained as scheduled.

41
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,800
So you ask, why the sixth time.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,400
Why are the batteries not being maintained
as scheduled?

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,256
Because the budgeting did not anticipate a
need for replacement or

44
00:02:50,256 --> 00:02:52,140
maintaining the batteries.

45
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,038
So, in this situation, when you drill
down, you're figuring out well,

46
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:56,520
let's get to the heart of the issue.

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,220
What's really going on here?

48
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,180
It's really kind of an issue of budgeting.

49
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,720
Why wasn't budgeting done to account for
battery maintenance?

50
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,570
Well, because the vendor said these
batteries will last forever.

51
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,600
So, if you drill it down, you look at the
core issues the root cause.

52
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,000
The reason, you know, you ask the five
whys and

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,900
drill down to the point where you can
really find out what that real reason is,

54
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,350
why something has actually contributed to
this adverse outcome.

55
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,600
If you looked at this question one or two,
you probably would've stopped and

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,150
said well, let's just make sure we go buy
more computers and

57
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,800
make sure they're all available so that
staff can do the double check.

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,341
Or, as we do in many cases, we go out and

59
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:41,310
fix the problem by addressing the first
thing we, we heard.

60
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,510
Which was, staff didn't do the double
check.

61
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,920
So, the immediate knee jerk reaction is,

62
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,500
well, let's go get the staff provide an in
service to them.

63
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,570
Review the policy and procedure, and make
sure they, you know, do that double-check.

64
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,791
And, you know, you may come to find, after
putting in that kind of a corrective

65
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,949
action plan, that within a few weeks,
maybe even a few days, you have the same

66
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:07,440
kind of event occurring again because you
really didn't address the root cause.

67
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,480
[BLANK_AUDIO].

68
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,600
So, we have a scenario.

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,530
We're going to do a mini root cause
analysis here.

70
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,700
And in this situation, you can, if you can
picture a block of

71
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,700
large very good Swiss cheese, you know,
I'm a kitchen table.

72
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,480
Few feet, few feet away from an open
screen door.

73
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,320
The weather outside is warm.

74
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,059
A, a man comes to the table for some wine
and cheese and sees a mouse in the cheese.

75
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,830
So, you got the vision in your head about
what you're looking at.

76
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,610
Well, you know, of course, we picked Swiss
cheese, because, you know,

77
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,524
if you, are aware of the James Reason's
model of why, you know, serious events,

78
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:54,619
accidents occur is that all the checks and
balances that are in place to try and

79
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:58,840
prevent a bad thing from happening, the
holes line up in this Swiss cheese, and

80
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,260
as a result, the outcome is going to be
that event.

81
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,300
So, in this case here,

82
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,450
we're actually going to try to enjoy the
cheese a little bit.

83
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,910
But it is a warm day and as a result, we
have the door open.

84
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,056
And the door's open because we need to get
some breeze into this room, and

85
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:21,030
we sit down, and you end up finding a
little mouse, inside that cheese.

86
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,370
So, here's the problem.

87
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,216
There is a mouse in the cheese,

88
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:29,890
that's the undesirable, unwanted,
untoward, event that was, that occurred.

89
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,254
So, what's our typical response, to this
kind of event,

90
00:05:35,254 --> 00:05:40,422
in this little element of brainstorming,
or blue-skying, or,

91
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:45,280
you know, well what were some of the
things we can do as possible solution.

92
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,403
Well, you know, our immediate response it
throw out the cheese with the mouse and

93
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:52,760
put a new block of cheese on the table.

94
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,190
That fixed the problem and what's the
likelihood of

95
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,590
a mouse showing up in the cheese again if
we really don't address the core issue?

96
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,916
Well, partially addressing a core issue,

97
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:09,110
if the mouse came from the outside, if we
replace the screen door.

98
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,355
That fixed the problem, it might be a
little bit of an overkill but

99
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:16,690
never the less, you know, by replacing the
door, hopefully it keeps the mouse out.

100
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,400
Or, as we have a tendency to do in
healthcare, you know, is put a sign up.

101
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,630
Anytime there's a deficiency put another
sign up.

102
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,300
Put a poster up.

103
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,884
In my experience posters, signage, you
know, up on the wall if it's up for

104
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:34,220
more than 21 days, people don't pay
attention to it.

105
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,454
But, we can actually, you know, provide a
solution in this scenario to keep mouses,

106
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:41,470
mice from being inside the cheese is put a
note on the door.

107
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,500
And just say, close me.

108
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,820
Alright.
Or keep door closed.

109
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,560
That, you know, another typical fix.

110
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,210
And I mentioned this one earlier where
basically we could create a policy.

111
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,230
Have everyone read and

112
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,610
sign and agree to follow the policy of
keeping the door closed.

113
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,380
And sometimes it comes down to the knee
jerk responses.

114
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,978
Gotta blame somebody, so fire or sue the
cheese maker.

115
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:08,786
They must a created a situation where a
mouse,

116
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:12,170
mice are able to be able to hide and get
in the cheese, and

117
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,396
as a result we can go out and fire or sue
the cheese maker.

118
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:19,312
We all know if you did any one of these
things, it's, you know,

119
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:21,580
the likelihood of a, another mice showing
up, or

120
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,360
another mouse showing up in the cheese is
very high, you know, is highly likely.

121
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,950
So, mouse and cheese, you ask why?

122
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,110
Well, mouse in the house, why is the mouse
in the house?

123
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,566
Screen doors are left open, why?

124
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:37,534
Cat is gone, left the screen door open,
solution, it actually create,

125
00:07:37,534 --> 00:07:42,014
create a situation where the screen door
with the spring latch is kept continuously

126
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:45,662
closed so that way you can enjoy that nice
breeze from the outside and

127
00:07:45,662 --> 00:07:47,960
enjoy your wine and cheese.

128
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,291
You know, I like this little saying that
nothing changes unless you make it change,

129
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,707
but you can't change what you don't know
what needs to be fixed and

130
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:58,935
that's the whole concept behind root cause
analysis.

131
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:03,735
My experience with doing them over the
last several years is that sometime we

132
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:08,120
knee-jerk to come up with the root cause
of a particular problem.

133
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,880
Quickly put in solutions, thinking that's
going to fix the problem.

134
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,708
And in realty, because we never actually
addressed the root cause or

135
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:19,887
the system process issue, those events
occur, again down the road.

136
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:25,139
