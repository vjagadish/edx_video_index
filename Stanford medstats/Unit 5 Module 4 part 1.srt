1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,500
In this next module,

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,800
I'm going to show you the distribution of
some common statistics.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,065
A mean, an odds ratio, and a correlation
coefficient.

4
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:21,710
In order to illustrate all of these, I'm
going to use some example data.

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,330
Some made up hypothetical data.

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,185
These are actually computer generated
data.

7
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:28,900
I have the computer generate some data,
and

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,910
it's loosely based on a real example in
the literature.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,480
About that, that study was looking at
middle age and

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,420
older European men, and it was looking at
Vitamin D levels and cognitive function.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,830
So I loosely based my made up data on that
study.

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,590
But it's just nice to have some toy data
play with this week.

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,640
There's 2 statistics that we're going to
look at from my hypothetical data.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,780
I chose a sample of 100, so my sample size
here is 100 in my hypothetical data.

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,359
We're going to look at the Vitamin D
levels in those 100 men.

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,190
And we're going to look at the correlation
between Vitamin D and

17
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,740
cognitive function in those 100 men.

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,350
And cognitive function was measured by a
particular test,

19
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,080
the Digit Symbol Substitution Test.

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,020
And for the purposes of generating this
made-up data,

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,360
I assumed that the true mean vitamin D in
all middle-aged and

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,690
older European men is somewhere around 62
nanomoles per liter, and

23
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,244
the true correlation coefficient between
vitamin D and IQ function.

24
00:01:25,244 --> 00:01:29,165
The cognitive function was 0.15, which was
a very weak correlation.

25
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:33,459
So let me just illustrate for you this
hypothetical, made-up data.

26
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:35,870
So, in the sample, I have a sample of a
100 men, and

27
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,230
I've got their vitamin D levels.

28
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,340
And I've plotted those vitamin d levels
here in histogram.

29
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,110
So, notice that the vitamin D levels in
the sample follow a right

30
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,175
skew distribution.

31
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:46,150
That makes sense for

32
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,990
something like vitamin D because you can't
get lower than zero.

33
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,770
But, you know, vitamin D can get quite
high in a handful of people.

34
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,690
So you get this tail up to the right.

35
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,800
The mean vitamin D turned out to be 63
nanomoles per liter in my sample.

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,540
And the standard deviation was 33
nanomoles per liter.

37
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,810
Here's a graph showing the correlation
between the vitamin D levels and

38
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,320
this cognitive test, the DSST score higher
values on

39
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,540
that cognitive test mean that are
cognitive function.

40
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,630
You can see that there's a small, very
weak,

41
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,110
positive correlation between vitamin D
levels and cognitive score.

42
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,910
And I built this into my made up data, a
very small weak correlation here.

43
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,589
You can actually calculate a statistic
that quantifies that correlation.

44
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:30,410
It's called the correlation coefficient
and

45
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,130
it comes out here to be a value of 0.15.

46
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,450
Some of you may have heard of correlation
[INAUDIBLE] coefficients before.

47
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,020
If you haven't, a correlation coefficient
is this nice little measure because its

48
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,690
unit less.

49
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,890
Its a value that ranges from negative one
to positive one.

50
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,700
If you're at zero or

51
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,588
somewhere close to zero, that means those
two variables are uncorrelated.

52
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:51,726
You're measuring the correlation between
two variables.

53
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:53,356
So zero would mean uncorrelated.

54
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:56,810
Positive 1 would be perfect positive
correlation.

55
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,210
Negative 1 would mean perfect inverse
correlation, that is that if vitamin D

56
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,500
levels went up and cognitive function went
down, and anything in between positive one

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,290
and zero or negative one and zero is some
kind of in between amount of correlation.

58
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,155
So 0.15 is pretty close to zero so it's a
small, it's a very weak correlation.

59
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,990
But the correlation coefficient in the
sample of

60
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,470
a hundred came out to be 0.15 here.

61
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,600
So how would I figure out, what's the
distribution of the mean here?

62
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,800
So we're going to use the mean Vitamin D
as my example.

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,180
What's the distribution of the mean?

64
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,160
How can I figure that out?

65
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,820
Well, I'm first going to figure it out by
running a computer simulation.

66
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,650
So, here's how the computer simulation
works.

67
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,490
I'm going to tell the computer that
there's some

68
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,180
large population of men European men.

69
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,710
And I'm going to tell the computer the
distribution of vitamin D in

70
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,410
this large population.

71
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,680
And I'm going to tell the computer it's a
right skewed distribution.

72
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,530
So vitamin D follows a right skewed
distribution.

73
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,670
It has a standard deviation of 33.

74
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,482
And let's say that the true mean value in
the the population is 62 [INAUDIBLE]

75
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:02,540
nanomoles per liter.

76
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,540
It doesn't matter too much what I pick
there.

77
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,790
But lets say I'm going to pick the value
of 62.

78
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,540
So I tell the computer, this is the
population you're sampling from.

79
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,915
And then I have the computer sample a
random sample of

80
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:17,730
100 virtual men from this underlying
population.

81
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,850
Each of those men is going to have a
vitamin D level.

82
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,460
I take those vitamin D levels and I
average them to calculate the mean.

83
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,580
Vitamin D level for that sample of 100.

84
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,580
Then I'm going to repeat the experiment
over and over and over again.

85
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,440
Again this is the though experiment.

86
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,095
I'm going to select a different random
sample of 100 men, calculate their mean.

87
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:38,660
Then I'm going to do that again and

88
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,298
again and again, to get a sense of the
distribution of the means.

89
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:45,607
I've arbitrarily decided to do that 10,000
times.

90
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:47,100
Again, 10,000's a pretty large number but

91
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,670
not so large that it will hang my
computer.

92
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,750
Then, then we can explore the distribution
of those 10,000 means.

93
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,600
We can actually look at the distribution
of the statistic here and

94
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,310
the statistic here is a sample mean.

95
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,130
[SOUND] So here's the results of this
computer simulation.

96
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,370
What you are looking at is the histogram.

97
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,230
On the Y axis is the count.

98
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:11,100
Out of 10,000 times, how much did
different outcomes, different means occur.

99
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,710
On the X axis is the mean vitamin D level.

100
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:18,940
So this represents the mean out of 100
men, and in each sample of a hundred men.

101
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,012
So you can see that most often we got a
mean of about 62,

102
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:28,810
somewhere around 62, because remember the
true mean in the population is 62.

103
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,390
So that's not surprising.

104
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,295
What else can we say about this
distribution?

105
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:34,800
Well, you might have noticed, and

106
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,340
this might have surprised you, that it
turns out to be normal distribution.

107
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,230
The means follow a normal distribution.

108
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,670
This is a little surprising because
remember, Vitamin D,

109
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,860
the trait followed a right skewed
distribution.

110
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,120
The, that distribution, that underlying
distribution is right skewed.

111
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,035
But, when we take the means, the means
follow a normal distribution.

112
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:04,500
And we can prove this with a theorem
called the central limit theorem.

113
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,010
For those of you who are interested in
that,

114
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,050
there's an optional module on the central
limit theorem.

115
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,890
But it turns out that when you take
averages,

116
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,260
averages follow a normal distribution.

117
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,900
Conceptually, what's going here is

118
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,120
you can image your on this right skew
distribution.

119
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,340
There's going to be a very few number of
people who have very high values.

120
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,950
So you might get a man in a particular
sample who has a value of 200 for example.

121
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,750
Well if you average that 200 in with 99
other men,

122
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,560
that has the effect of bringing everything
towards the center.

123
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,138
So that 200 really gets diluted, because
you averaged it with 99 other men.

124
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:43,790
So it ends up when you take averages, it
ends

125
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,040
up bringing everything towards the middle
and it ends up forming a normal curve.

126
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,180
The mean of the means, I'm going to say
that again, the mean of the means,

127
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,060
that's the, this is the mean of the means
we're talking about here.

128
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,400
The mean of the means turned out to be 62
nanomoles per liter.

129
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,750
Well, that's just the true value, the true
mean, so that's not surprising.

130
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,730
The mean of the means is the true mean in
the population.

131
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,870
Well that makes sense because if that's
the true mean,

132
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,140
then most of our samples should hover
around 62, the true mean.

133
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,970
The standard deviation of the means turns
out to be 3.3 nanomoles per liter.

134
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,191
Now that's interesting, you remember that
the, the standard deviation of the trait

135
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,357
was 33 nanomoles per liter [SOUND] but the
standard deviation of the means which we

136
00:07:23,357 --> 00:07:30,304
also called the standard error of the mean
turns out to be 3.3.

137
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:35,930
It's exactly 33 divided by 10.

138
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,940
Well, the sample size here was 100, so
what we're actually doing is,

139
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,350
we're dividing the standard deviation by
the square root of n, and

140
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,182
that's what gives us the 3.3.

141
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:48,830
This 3.3, I didn't get by a mathematical
theory though.

142
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,955
I just had the computer calculate the
standard deviation from these

143
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:54,560
10,000 observations.

144
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,860
And it turns out to be 3.3.

145
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,790
So, the distribution of mean vitamin D
that I got from this computer simulation.

146
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,710
I see that it's normally distributed.

147
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,230
The mean is equal to the true mean.

148
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,000
And the standard deviation, or

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,020
what we also call the standard error, is
3.3 nanomoles per liter.

150
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,570
I got this all out of the computer
simulation.

151
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,250
But the distribution of a sample mean,

152
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,180
in general, people have long ago worked
out with mathematical theory.

153
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,080
And it turns out that if you're talking
about sample means,

154
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,040
means that you calculate from data, they
follow,

155
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,509
actually they don't exactly follow a
normal distribution.

156
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,220
If you want to know more about why that
is,

157
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,910
watch the optional module on the Central
Limit Theorem.

158
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,150
It turns out they follow a T-distribution,
but

159
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,140
remember that a T-distribution is
essentially the same as a normal

160
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,530
distribution as long as you're talking
about n's sample sizes at least of 100.

161
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,450
So since we have a sample size of over
100, essentially it's,

162
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,940
it's on a normal distribution.

163
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,060
This means that if you're talking about
sample means and

164
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,430
you're talking about small samples,

165
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,710
actually small samples you have to worry
about it being on a T-distribution.

166
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,590
You'll have slightly fatter tails than the
normal.

167
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,890
So it's not exactly, means don't exactly
follow a normal distribution for

168
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,430
real data.

169
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,560
They usually follow a T but by the time
you're talking about a sample size of

170
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,730
greater than 100 where, where it's
interchangeable with the normal.

171
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,540
So I'm just going to call it a normal
distribution.

172
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,400
In general, sample means the mean of the
means is the true mean in the population.

173
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,890
Well, that make sense.

174
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,110
The standard error, somebody has worked
out the formula for standard error,

175
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,110
the standard error of a mean is the
standard deviation of the trait,

176
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,500
the variability of the trait like vitamin
D,

177
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,740
divided by the square root of n, the
number of people you're averaging over.

178
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,960
And let's remember,

179
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,940
we saw that that in fact works out with
exactly what we saw in the simulation

180
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,520
because the standard deviation here was 33
if I divide by the square root of 100.

181
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,480
I get exactly 3.3, exactly what came out
in the simulation as well.

182
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,980
So both the simulation and mathematical
theory are matching up.

183
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,400
So the standard error of a mean,

184
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,210
again, is the standard deviation of the
trait divided by the square root of n.

185
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,130
So you can see some things about how
standard error works just by

186
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:00,980
looking at the formula.

187
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,490
The formula gives us some insight here.

188
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,890
I don't, we're not worry about memorizing
the formula but

189
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,010
look at the formula in terms of what is it
telling us.

190
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:13,030
So standard error decreases as sample size
goes up because sample sizes in

191
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,830
the denominator.

192
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,610
So bigger sample size means less standard
error.

193
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,950
Well that makes sense.

194
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,540
As you sample more people you would expect
the uncertainty to go down,

195
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,740
the imprecision to go down.

196
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,720
The variability of the static from sample
to sample will go down if

197
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,990
you're sampling more people.

198
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,290
going to get closer to the true mean.

199
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,420
The standard error increases with greater
trait variability, that, that s,

200
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,890
that standard deviation of the sample is
in the numerator.

201
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,380
So if vitamin D were more variable,

202
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,730
that's going to cause more variation from
in the statistic.

203
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,380
Right?
It's going to cause more uncertainly.

204
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,400
So those are the two elements of standard
error.

205
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,260
And just to illustrate those,

206
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,830
I did another simulation where I increased
the sample sizes to 400.

207
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,390
So I did many, many, many samples of 400.

208
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,820
Notice to what happened to my normal
curve, it shrunk.

209
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,970
It, the standard deviation went down.

210
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,970
The standard deviation in this situation
came up to be 1.7.

211
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,510
My mathematical theory would predict that
it would be 1.7.

212
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,110
If Vitamin D was more variable, let's say
the standard deviation of Vitamin D in

213
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,210
the population was 40 rather than 33,

214
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,240
you can see that that causes this curve to
widen.

215
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,840
The standard error goes up here, it goes
up to four because if Vitamin D

216
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,995
is more variable we get more variations in
the means from sample to sample.

217
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:29,110
So standard error again depends on the the
variability of

218
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,110
the trait as well as the sample size.
