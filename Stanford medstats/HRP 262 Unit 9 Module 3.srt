1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,160
In this next module, I'm going to show you
how to fit a mixed model

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,280
with a time independent predictor, and
this is very similar to what we did with

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,040
generalized estimating equations, the
interpretation of the beta coefficients is

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,930
pretty similar so hopefully if you
understood the material last week,

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,259
this module will be pretty easy.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,660
I'm going to use this same data set, on
bone density in women runners,

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,070
these 41 women runners, divided into the
three groups.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,220
You've seen these pictures before, so I
won't explain them again.

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,920
I'm going to take that same data,.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,310
And fit first in a random intercepts only
model.

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,170
So in this model, I just allow the
intercepts to be random.

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,520
And I did not put in a random time slope.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,520
And, so what you'll see here is this is
very similar to the results.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,930
That we got out of the generalized
estimating equation for these same data.

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,560
The effect for time.

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,982
The main effect for time is interpreted as
the rate of change in time for the blue

17
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:06,210
group, and that's very close to 0 because
the blue group is mostly flat here.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,615
The intercept represents the baseline
spinebone density

19
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,700
a- average score in the reference group,

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,630
in the blue group, as before, as with
generalized estimating equations.

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,290
The main effect for the black group and
the red group represent the difference at

22
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:28,110
baseline in the spine bone density in the
black group versus the blue group and

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,430
in the red group versus the blue group.

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,510
So for example,.

25
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,400
The black group was about 0.03698 higher
in bone density on average than

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,990
the blue group at baseline.

27
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,170
Those differences were not statistically
significant,

28
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,000
just saying that at baseline the black and
red groups were higher, but

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,770
they weren't statistically, that wasn't a
statistically significant difference.

30
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,250
The blue group is the reference group.

31
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,098
And then we get what we care most about,

32
00:01:51,098 --> 00:01:54,730
which is the interactions between the
group variable and time.

33
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,570
And you can see that we get for

34
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:04,420
the black vi time interaction .01079 that
would be interpreted at a .01079 increase.

35
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:10,210
In spine bone density which is measured in
grams per centimeter squared.

36
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,730
However, the average spine bone density
you know you can see

37
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,590
that it's very close to 1.0.

38
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,830
It's a little bit, just a hair under 1.0
in this population.

39
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,936
And so that is very close to a better 1%
increase in bone density, per year,

40
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:24,710
over time.

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,025
And the increase in the red group is just
slightly higher at 0.

42
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:34,260
0.14 advance per centimeter squared per
year.

43
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,690
And both of those are statistically
significant.

44
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,020
And these are very, very similar
estimates.

45
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,400
To what we've got for a, from the
generalized estimate equations.

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,960
If you look at the P values and the data
coefficients, you have to go,

47
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,030
like, to the third decimal place to see
any difference.

48
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,810
I want to just point out the AIC, fit
statistics here.

49
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,630
So, I wanted to point out, that, for
whatever reason we ended up with

50
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,150
negative values for the the AIC, and that
can happen sometime in [UNKNOWN].

51
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,080
Models.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,090
When you have negative values for the AIC,
even though their outputs are.

53
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,740
Smaller is better.

54
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,150
Closer to 0 is better.

55
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,530
So you want to be smaller in the absolute
value.

56
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,310
So the value, we want to pay attention to.

57
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,080
Ignore the sign and just pay attention to
the 410.6 here.

58
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,930
I just want to show you this [INAUDIBLE]
code so

59
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,480
you know exactly what I'm doing here.

60
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,720
I have.

61
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,330
Fit a model with a random statement, but
only a random intercept so far.

62
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,990
So I then went ahead and fed a model with
both a random intercept and

63
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,780
a random slope just to see the comparison.

64
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,180
What you'll notice is that if you just
kind of scan across the point

65
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,240
estimates for the beta coefficients and
the P values,

66
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,360
nothing is material, materially different,
they're all pretty similar.

67
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,450
We're still getting significant effects.

68
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,608
For the group by time effects the beta
coefficients are very close to what we

69
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:50,340
got before.

70
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,820
So it didn't make a huge difference here.

71
00:03:52,820 --> 00:04:00,950
But I want to point out that the AIC was
about 410 before, it's now at 419.5.

72
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:05,040
And so we want to be smaller in the
absolute value, so

73
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,630
actually, the random intercept only model
is a much better fit.

74
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,770
Than the model with also a random slope.

75
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,900
The random intercept model only model was
sufficient to capture the between

76
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,000
subject variability and account for the
correlation within subject.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,560
There wasn't a lot of variation in the
slope over time here.

78
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,410
And again just to show you the code, I
have put a random statement in.

79
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,410
Random effect for the intercept and for
time and

80
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,840
I also had to specify the covariance
matrix for

81
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,750
this g matrix of the random effects.

82
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,650
And then finally, I had also wanted to
show you similar to what I showed last

83
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,360
week for generalized estimating equations
that you can put

84
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,990
a continuous time-independent predictor in
as well.

85
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,880
So, I took the baseline calcium in the
diet for these women.

86
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,230
That was in Z scores, I had, taken the
residual calcium to correct for

87
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,840
calories, and I put into, standardized
units, so Z scores.

88
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,730
And we get very similar output again to
what you saw in

89
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,840
the generalized estimating equations last
week.

90
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,050
I ran this model with a random intercept
only,

91
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,640
because that turned out to have the best
model fit again.

92
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,670
This is from a larger data set, this data
set has 125 women.

93
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,940
So more of that same,

94
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,830
more than the 41 women that were included
in the other analysis.

95
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,960
But the random intercept model still
turned out to be superior here.

96
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,140
Let me just walk you through how do I
interpret all of this.

97
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,120
So the intercept is .9888.

98
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,750
So that would say that at base line, when
time equals 0,

99
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,270
and at a calcium standardized residual
square of 0, which would represent,

100
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,200
a Z square of 0 would represent the
average calcium intake here.

101
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,100
So if you were at, have the average
calcium intake at base line then at.

102
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,680
Based on your, spine bone density.

103
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,970
Was, on average, about .9888.

104
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,640
And of course that's significantly
different than 0.

105
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,940
Because we don't have, you know?

106
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,000
You can't have a skeleton that has no,
grams of calcium in it.

107
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:03,220
The time effect here is also statistically
significant, it's .0035.

108
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,628
And this time effect would correspond to
somebody with,

109
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:09,090
again, a calcium score, z score of 0.

110
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,950
So the average calcium intake.

111
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,184
They were going up about .0035 in grams
per centimeter squared in

112
00:06:15,184 --> 00:06:17,750
[UNKNOWN] over density over time.

113
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,910
It's a small effect but it is a real
increase over time per year.

114
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,000
If the main effect for calcium here
represents that

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
every one standard deviation unit higher
than you were in calcium and.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,840
Baseline corresponse is you would have a
slightly lower spine bone

117
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,040
density although it's very, this data
coefficient's very, very close to 0 and

118
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,150
it's not statistically significant.

119
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,480
In other words, your baseline calcium was
not strongly related to

120
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,300
your baseline bone strength.

121
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,990
However, if you're eating a lot of calcium
at a baseline.

122
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,440
If we interact with time, you'll see that
there was a near-significant,

123
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,350
increase in spine bone density over time,
if you had a high calcium diet.

124
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,240
So somebody who had a Z score of one, at
baseline had a high calcium diet,

125
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,110
they were predicted to have a higher rate
of change in bone density, over time.

126
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,480
So if you had the average in calcium, you
were 0.003506.

127
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:21,100
Somebody who was at one standard deviation
higher than average in calcium

128
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,620
would be predicted to have 0.001807 higher
rate of change so yu can add those up and

129
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,570
they, they're rate of change would be
about 0.005 rather than 0.0035, so

130
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,670
again, it's a small difference,.

131
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,750
But it is statistically significant so
eating more calcium does seem to

132
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,350
positively affect your bone strength over
time.
