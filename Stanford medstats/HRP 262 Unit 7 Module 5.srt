1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,470
In this next module,

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,420
we're going to continue our discussion of
repeated-measures ANOVA.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,600
However, we're going to complicate the
picture just slightly by now adding

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,040
a comparison of groups.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,834
So, we're going to use the same, simple,
example data set as in the last module.

6
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:25,118
But now we're going to distinguish between
whether subjects are in group A or

7
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:27,030
whether they are in group B.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,620
Again, these are depression scores
measured at four time points.

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,010
So, we can add that distinction to the
graphics.

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,200
So, here I've graphed people according to
whether or

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,000
not they're in group B or in group A.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,320
It's a little bit messy to see patterns
here.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,290
So, I'll then graph the mean plots.

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,000
So here is the mean for group B and the
mean for group A.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,870
And you notice that group B in general
seems to be

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,660
a little bit higher than group A.

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,870
But they both follow the same general
pattern over time.

18
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,320
The both start a little higher, kind of
drop a little bit in time point three,

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,680
and then go back up in time point four.

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,260
And there's a number of questions that we
can ask in terms of

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,240
statistical significance.

22
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,170
There's more than one question we can ask.

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,370
We can ask about what's called the time
effect.

24
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,660
Is there anything significant changes, or
differences over time?

25
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,320
So, for example,

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,000
is time point three significantly
different than the other time points?

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,760
We can ask whether there's any change over
time, overall kind of ignoring group.

28
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,780
That's called the time effect.

29
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:28,320
We can ask whether the groups differ at
all, kind of ignoring time points.

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,150
So just overall, sort of
cross-sectionally, is B higher than A?

31
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,700
Is that a significant difference?

32
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,100
That would be called the group effect.

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,950
And then, finally, the effect that we're
going to comp, care most about is

34
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,470
actually the interaction between those
two, the time by group effect.

35
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,120
And what that is telling us is whether or
not there any, are any

36
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,480
significant differences in the changes
over time between group B and group A.

37
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,090
So it's the pattern over time different in
group B than in group A?

38
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,110
And that's what we really care about.

39
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,000
From this graphic,

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,300
just looking at this graphic, it does not
look like the time by group effect would

41
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,770
be significant here because they seem to
have basically the same pattern over time.

42
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,434
One thing that you need to kind of get
clear in your mind before we

43
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:16,325
jump into the ANOVA here is the difference
between a between-subjects effect and

44
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,130
a within-subjects effect.

45
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,610
So let me just clarify that a little bit.

46
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,030
So when I talk about a between-subjects
effect,

47
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,742
this is anything where you're literally
just comparing between subjects.

48
00:02:28,742 --> 00:02:33,320
So when we calculated in the previous
module, the sum of squares between,

49
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,180
that was comparing, say, subject one
versus subject two.

50
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,020
That's between-subjects because it's
comparing different subjects.

51
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,200
When we're going to be talking about
groups, comparing group A, for

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,850
example, versus group B.

53
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,530
What I'm going to call the group effect.

54
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,440
When we compare the groups, that's
going to be a between-subjects effect.

55
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,460
Because, there are three people in group A
and three different people in group B.

56
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:05,270
So, any differences between the groups
would be a between-subject effect.

57
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:10,110
Something where somebody in group A is
different than somebody in group B.

58
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,020
When we talk about within-subjects
effects, so

59
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,451
this is just sort of like the individual
effect.

60
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:20,585
[SOUND] If we talk about within-subjects
effects, well,

61
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:24,505
we're talking about things that are
happening over time.

62
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,148
Because, what does it mean to be within a
subject?

63
00:03:26,148 --> 00:03:29,004
That means we've got the same subject at
different time points and

64
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:32,110
we're comparing the same subject at
different time points.

65
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,810
So, if I compare subject one at time point
one

66
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,194
to subject one at time point two that
would be a within-subject comparison.

67
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,830
And this is going to correspond roughly to
what I'm going to call the time effect.

68
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,100
Over time our individual subject's
changing.

69
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,310
So that's the time effect.

70
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:05,610
So we want to know whether or not the
within-subjects changes in group A,

71
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,960
for example, are different than the
within-subject changes over time

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:17,200
changes in group B.

73
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,709
And this would correspond to what I'm
calling the time by group effect.

74
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,889
because it's actually asking to look at an
individual subject over time and

75
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,657
say whether or not they're changing.

76
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:30,230
And is that change different in one group
versus the other.

77
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,236
So in our output from repeated-measures
ANOVA,

78
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:36,450
we're going to get things that correspond
to between-subject effects,

79
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,170
that is just individual variability, as
well as what group you're in.

80
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,290
And we're going to get things that
correspond to within-subjects effects.

81
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,450
This is the time effect, and the time by
group effect.

82
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,219
You'll get two pieces in your output.

83
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:54,641
I'm going to start just by analyzing the
data with a regular two-way ANOVA here,

84
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:58,686
ignoring the fact that we have
repeated-measures just to illustrate.

85
00:04:58,686 --> 00:05:02,557
All of the variability, the sums of
squares, add up in ANOVA.

86
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:05,625
So we're just going to break down all of
the variability but we're going to

87
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:09,720
ignore for the moment the, the fact that
we have the same subjects over time.

88
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,760
So I'm going to run an ANOVA, a two-way
ANOVA,

89
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,020
on the long form of the data ignoring the
correlations within subjects.

90
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,020
I have used the long form of the data here
because I'm sort of pretending that I

91
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,570
just have 24 independent people, that's
not the same people over time.

92
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,700
And my predictors are, what time period
you're on, that's like one factor.

93
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,440
What group you're in, that's a second
factor.

94
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,345
And then the interaction,

95
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:34,600
two-way ANOVAs usually have the
interaction between those two.

96
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,560
So I, this is going to be the incorrect
two-way ANOVA.

97
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,450
But let me just show you how it's
calculated, because there's only going to

98
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,810
be one additional thing we have to do to
do this correctly.

99
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,860
So now we've got the distinction of group
and time.

100
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,510
So I can calculate the, mean for

101
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:54,360
each group at each time point, and I can
calculate the mean for each group overall.

102
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,580
So now I'm going to calculate several
things.

103
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,290
First of all, I can calculate a sum of
squares between time.

104
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,820
We actually already did that.

105
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,080
So the overall mean for time one was 27.

106
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,872
We subtract the overall, the mean overall
for all 24 measurements, that was also 27.

107
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,932
If you recall the mean for time two, time
point two for

108
00:06:15,932 --> 00:06:20,150
all six subjects was 28 minus the overall
mean, and so on and so forth.

109
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,530
We already calculated this, so that stays
the same.

110
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,569
The sum of squares between time is still
224.79.

111
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:30,469
Now, we're going to add a sum of squares
between groups, and

112
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:31,800
how do we calculate that?

113
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,350
Well, we look at the mean for each group
overall, and

114
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,220
the mean for group A and the mean for
group B.

115
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,365
So, ignoring time point, the mean for
group A is 24.75.

116
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:45,013
We're going to compare that to the overall
mean, ignoring time point, the,

117
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:46,680
the mean for group B is 29.3.

118
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,794
We're going to compare that to the overall
mean.

119
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:52,290
So, 29.3 minus 27 squared, plus 24.75
minus 27 squared.

120
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,910
We have to multiply by 12 because we need
24 terms in the sum of squares,

121
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,750
24 sum of squares things, that comes out
to be 126.

122
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,320
So that's the sum of squares between
group.

123
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,320
Now when we calculate the sum of squares
error the unexplained variability,

124
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,360
we're going to be taking the, each person.

125
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,810
And subtracting now from their group and
time mean.

126
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,640
So, so person, subject one, at time point
one, had a depression score of 31.

127
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,400
We're going to compare that to the mean
for group A at time point one.

128
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,760
So we'll do a 31 minus 23,

129
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,070
and then we're going to do a 24 minus 23
squared, 14 minus 23 squared.

130
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,598
So each subject is going to comp, be
compared only to the current time point,

131
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:40,290
and to their, to their, their group's mean
at that time point.

132
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,080
So we do that for all 24 subjects.

133
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,240
We get 24 sum squares.

134
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,841
That comes out to be 100, 523.

135
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,110
And then there's one additional thing we
need to worry about.

136
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,900
So we've got now, two factors, time and
group.

137
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,170
And we're going to need to calculate the
sum of squares for their interaction.

138
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,930
And the easiest way to do that is just to
remember that sum of

139
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,500
squares always sum up.

140
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,256
So we're going to take the sum of squares
total, which we found,

141
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:04,266
we calculated before, was 900.96.

142
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:07,590
We're going to sat, subtract away the sum
of squares for time, the sum of

143
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,880
squares for group, and the sum of squares
error, the ones we've already calculated.

144
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,620
That will give us this, the, sum of
squares for the group by time interaction.

145
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,950
That comes out to be 26.79.

146
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,680
So, not very big here.

147
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,540
That gives us, with our breakdown now.

148
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,660
We know, of course, we've ignored subject,
at this point,

149
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,000
but this breaks down everything else.

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,340
We can then ask the computer, or put this
together in a, in ANOVA table.

151
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,892
Again, so we then ended up with our
explained variability.

152
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:37,064
That's due to which group you're in or
which time period you're at, or

153
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:38,472
the interaction of those two.

154
00:08:38,472 --> 00:08:40,519
Those summed up to 377.

155
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:47,500
So if you add up the 224, 126 and 26.79,
that gives you a total of 377.

156
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,810
The unexplained variability is 523, the
total is 900.

157
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,833
We can calculate our F statistic and our
p-value.

158
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,120
It turns out to be not statistically
significant.

159
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,840
And then, we can break it down to the
source of the variability.

160
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,232
So, we have a time effect, a group effect,
and a time by group effect.

161
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:07,180
We already calculated those, 224, 126 and
26.

162
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,706
We can calculate corresponding F-values,
and

163
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:14,120
then we get p-values that go with those.

164
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,920
So the p-value for time is 0.11, the
p-value here for

165
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,630
group is 0.06, and the p-value for time by
group is 0.84.

166
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,960
So now, of course, we have to correctly
account for

167
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,430
the between-subjects variability, that's
what's missing in this picture.

168
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,620
So let's do that now.

169
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,913
So to do this the correct way, remember
the unexplained variability is 523.

170
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:36,693
Once I account for

171
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:40,308
which subject I'm talking about, I'm going
to reduce some of the variability.

172
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:44,408
Because subject one, of course, you know,
might be higher than subject two.

173
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:45,394
They're always going to be higher.

174
00:09:45,394 --> 00:09:48,477
That explains some of the variability.

175
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:49,517
Same as before, so

176
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:53,973
I'm going to run a repeated-measures
ANOVA, the correct analysis on this data.

177
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:57,543
And all that I'm going to additionally add
now, we've already calculated the sum of

178
00:09:57,543 --> 00:09:59,809
squares between groups, the sum of squares
time.

179
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:03,463
We've already calculated the interaction
between group and time,

180
00:10:03,463 --> 00:10:08,090
now we additionally have to calculate the
sum of squares between subjects.

181
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,486
So how do I do that?

182
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:12,850
So the sum of squares between subjects I
calculate by taking the mean for

183
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,480
each subject, fro, for each subject.

184
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,601
And now I'm going to compare it to the
group mean.

185
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:24,529
And so, 25.25 minus 24.75, 26 minus 24.75,
23 minus 24.75,

186
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,950
all of these squared of course.

187
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,800
We're going to do this for all of the
subjects, all six subjects and

188
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,480
then multiply by 4 to get a total of 24
squared things.

189
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,926
This gives me a total value of 150.

190
00:10:37,926 --> 00:10:43,848
If you remember, when we calculated the
sum of squares between-subjects

191
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:49,681
when we didn't have a group factor in,
that came out to be about 276.

192
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:51,977
When I calculate it now after I have
accounted for

193
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:53,625
group, it comes out to be 150.

194
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,583
But remember, that the between,

195
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:02,558
the sum of squares between groups was
actually equal to 126.

196
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:08,226
So, if you add those two up, the total
variability between subject was 276.

197
00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:12,179
But now some of the variability between
some of the differences between subject

198
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:16,278
has, subjects has now been explained by
which group you're in, 126 of that.

199
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:19,788
So 150 represents the remaining
variability that

200
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:23,100
exists between subjects not explained by
group.

201
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,670
The unexplained variability is therefore
going to be reduced from 523,

202
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,260
we subtract away this 150 and it's reduced
down to 373.

203
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,450
We've lowered our unexplained variability
now.

204
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,730
In our output from repeated-measures
ANOVA,

205
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,750
we're now going to get two elements.

206
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,870
We're going to get what are called
between-subjects effects.

207
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,820
Usually, these are of less interest.

208
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,500
We actually care less about these.

209
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,890
This, these have to do with the
differences between subjects.

210
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,160
And usually, that's not what we care
about.

211
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,240
We don't care that subject one happens to
be,

212
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,410
have higher depression than subject two.

213
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,929
We care about how things are changing over
time, usually.

214
00:12:00,994 --> 00:12:02,932
So so I tend to end up ignoring these, but

215
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:04,911
you have to understand where they come
from.

216
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:10,010
So the between-group sum of squares we
already calculated was 126.

217
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:16,050
The between-subject variability, the
unexplained variability between subjects.

218
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,880
So the differences between subjects that
aren't due to group but

219
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,900
what's left over is this 150.

220
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:26,060
This you can, you can compare what's
explained and

221
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,650
what's unexplained here in the normal way
we would for ANOVA.

222
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:33,180
And you can get a p-value, and this is
what I've been calling the group effect.

223
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,820
So this is completely ignoring changes
over time and

224
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,965
just seeing, out of all the differences
between subject, the subject,

225
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:43,967
subject one versus two, two versus three,
et cetera.

226
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:45,850
How much of the differences are explained
by whether or

227
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,240
not you're in group A versus B?

228
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,690
And how much, many of the differences
between subjects are left unexplained?

229
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,300
And so, it doesn't quite come out to be
statistically significant here.

230
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,200
And the picture is, what you're really
comparing is, is line, the blue line,

231
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,420
is it significantly higher than the red
line?

232
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,500
That's what the group effect is asking
about.

233
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Now notice that the p-value comes out to
be 0.14.

234
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,080
Here, if we go back to when I did the
wrong analysis, the p-value was smaller,

235
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,810
it was 0.06.

236
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,158
Because remember, when you fail to account
for correlation for between-subjects

237
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:21,080
comparisons or between-group comparisons,
the p-values will end up too small.

238
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,700
We see that here.

239
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,388
The correct p-value was actually higher
than what we got

240
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,360
with the incorrect analysis.

241
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,450
So that's the group effect.

242
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,970
Again, we don't usually care whether or

243
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,210
not group B happened to be a little
higher, overall, than group A.

244
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,330
We usually care about comparing their chi,
their differences over time.

245
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,060
But that's what the group effect is.

246
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,830
You also get, within-subjects effects, in
a separate section of your output.

247
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:46,070
This is talking about the time effect and
the time by group effect.

248
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,350
Which are usually the things that we care
about.

249
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,315
The error, the unexplained variability in
terms of

250
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:52,880
within-subjects effects, is now this 373.

251
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,990
We already calculated the sum of the
squares between time and

252
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,590
the sum of squares for the interaction.

253
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,700
We take all of these.

254
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,490
We can calculate F statistics and
p-values.

255
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,340
Notice that the p-values that come out
here are smaller than the ones that we

256
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,090
got when we failed to account for the
differences between subjects.

257
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,220
However, again, with this data set, we
haven't met compound symmetry.

258
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,430
So, we would probably be more correct to
report the a,

259
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:24,850
the corrected p-values that have corrected
for that violation of compound symmetry.

260
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,254
And those are 0.17 and 0.69.

261
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:32,120
These are not significant, and well, that
kind of matches the picture.

262
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,660
The time effect is getting towards
significance.

263
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,620
And that would say that there's some
differences over time.

264
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,140
And, indeed, if you look at time point
three,

265
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,400
time point three looks a little bit
different than the other time points.

266
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,790
That's what the time effect is asking.

267
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,034
Just is there any overall differences over
time.

268
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:48,762
Something where there wasn't a time
effect, you know,

269
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,500
would sort of look flat over time.

270
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,680
We have a little bit of a blip in time
point three.

271
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,080
That's, you know, getting us towards the
statistical significant.

272
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,340
The time by group effect is ask, asking
whether the pattern of changes over time,

273
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,700
this is essentially whether the slopes of
these two lines are equal.

274
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,970
And clearly, those lines are pretty
parallel with one another.

275
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,020
So it doesn't look like there's much
differences in the the trajectory over

276
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,750
time between the groups.

277
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,350
And that's reflected in this very non
significant p-value for

278
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,610
the time by group effect.

279
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,480
And that's usually what we care most
about.

280
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,240
So from this repeated-measures ANOVA
analysis,

281
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,584
we can sort of answer three questions.

282
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:27,610
We can ask is there overall significant
differences between time points.

283
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,550
That's the main effect for time.

284
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,140
We did not find a significant effect here.

285
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,410
I'm reporting the adjusted p-value here,

286
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,440
because of that violation of compound
symmetry.

287
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,880
Do the two groups differ at any time
points?

288
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,530
So this is ignoring time,

289
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,940
just as though a blue line higher than the
red line overall.

290
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,010
And that did not come out to

291
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,620
be significant either in the correct
analysis.

292
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,960
And then finally what we care most about,

293
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,260
do the two groups differ in their
responses over time?

294
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,080
That's that time by group interaction and
clearly that's totally not significant.

295
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,990
And again, that matches what we see in the
picture, but

296
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,652
it's just adding some p-values to it.

297
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,930
Another thing that you can get easily,

298
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,380
at least in SASS, is something that you
can use just for exploration.

299
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,980
I wouldn't use this as a formal test.

300
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,940
But, it's very easy in SASS to ask for
what's called a polynomial.

301
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,600
You can test for the shape of the response
profile.

302
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,320
I find this a useful tool,

303
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,570
because when we build to doing regression
models like GE and mixed models.

304
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:26,770
We are going to be putting in time as a
linear term, usually.

305
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,700
But what if there isn't actually a linear
change over time?

306
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,370
What if there's a quadratic change?

307
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,940
You can kind of probe that with this
little, asking for

308
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,890
this polynomial, which is one little
additional piece of code,

309
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,100
when you're asking for repeated-measures
ANOVA in SASS.

310
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,260
So it's fun just to ask for that.

311
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,230
Remember that the shape here for the two
groups, it looks something like that.

312
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,340
So that's probably best modeled as, as a
cubic, if anything.

313
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:55,210
And that's what comes out here, in fact,
that, it gives you some output for

314
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,690
linear, quadratic, and cubic.

315
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,950
Since we have four time points, we can go
up as high as cubic.

316
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,720
And, none of these come out significant.

317
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,980
The cubic one, however, is bordering on
significant.

318
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,830
Indicating that this is probably best mea,
estimated as a cubic if, if anything.

319
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:17,770
Now let me apply repeated-measures ANOVA
back to that same bone density example.

320
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,350
So remember this is the picture for the
bone density example.

321
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,150
I've got these three groups.

322
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,450
We're measuring their bone density over
time.

323
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,490
And it did look like the red group and

324
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,220
the black group seemed to be doing better
overall than the blue group.

325
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,280
So, I've now, I'm showing you the output
just from

326
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,790
the within-subjects output from a
repeated-measures ANOVA.

327
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,300
I'm not even bothering to show you the
between-subjects output,

328
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,922
although I'll get that output.

329
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:45,410
The between-subject output would say
whether or not,

330
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,590
overall, ignoring time point the groups
differ, and that's not really of interest.

331
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,240
What I want to know is whether or not
their, their changes in

332
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,780
bone density over time are different
between the different groups.

333
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,872
So, I'm going to get two things of
interest here.

334
00:17:56,872 --> 00:17:58,060
I get a time effect and

335
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:03,300
a time by group effect when I put these
data into repeated-measures ANOVA.

336
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,380
The time effect is highly significant, and
by the way,

337
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,730
the epsilons here are very close to one.

338
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,270
These data actually very well meet
compound symmetry.

339
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,740
So highly significant result for time.

340
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,940
What that's saying is that, ignoring
group,

341
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,570
if you were to just kind of draw a line
which didn't distinguish between blue,

342
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,606
red and black, sort of the overall changes
across all groups.

343
00:18:23,606 --> 00:18:28,346
You can imagine that it's going to be
something like if this is zero,

344
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:31,210
they're definitely going up on average.

345
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,370
Even if you average in the blue group,
it's going to be something like that.

346
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,230
So that's saying that there really is a
significant change over time,

347
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,130
highly significant.

348
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,388
Their bone density, on average, is going
up, ignoring group.

349
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:46,150
The time by group effect is going to
answer the question of whether or

350
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:50,600
not the, there any differences in the
changes over time between the groups.

351
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,900
It's not going to tell you where those
differences lie because it's an ANOVA,

352
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,310
it's a global test.

353
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:59,490
But we're bordering, we didn't quite make
statistical significance, but it's 0.06.

354
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,240
Saying that somewhere, some group is at
least one group differs from

355
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,530
the other in terms of their changes in
bone density over time.

356
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,000
And you can see that the blue group
doesn't change,

357
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,510
whereas the other two go out.

358
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,110
Didn't quite reach statistical
significance, but it's very close.

359
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,210
So that would be applying
repeated-measures ANOVA to that example.

360
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,480
Just for fun, I also asked for that
polynomial function, to see whether or

361
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,070
not the changes over time are more linear
or more quadratic.

362
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,670
I only have three times points, so the
most I can ask for is quadratic here.

363
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:32,280
This corresponds to the picture where I
tried to plot things,

364
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,680
in fitting smoothing lines.

365
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,300
And you can see that it looks like there's
a little curvature there,

366
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,680
but, basically those are pretty straight
lines.

367
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,970
Or, that would probably be best modeled as
straight lines.

368
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,540
The blue looks kind of flat, and then the
other two are going up over time.

369
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,710
And, indeed, when I ask for linear versus
quadratic, I get pretty significant for

370
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,230
linear and nothing for quadratic.

371
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,030
So that just gives me a sense of that
matches the picture.

372
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,490
That probably if I'm going to be doing
regression on these data,

373
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,880
it would be fine for me to model time as a
linear component and

374
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,881
assume that the changes over time were
linear.
