00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,120
Hello, students.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,320
We'll learn about a system that will
revolutionize molecular medicine.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,870
The system is called CRISPR, which can
target any site in the genome.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,225
What is CRISPR?

5
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:16,237
Well, what CRISPR stands for

6
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:24,560
[NOISE] is clustered regularly
interspersed short palindromic repeats.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,560
The repeats are depicted here by back to
back triangles,

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,317
because they're palindromic.

9
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:32,830
And the repeats are separated from each
other by spacers,

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,068
each with a different DNA sequence.

11
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:42,251
[SOUND] There's a leader to initiate
transcription.

12
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:45,228
And there is a terminator to stop
transcription.

13
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:49,716
[SOUND] Now [SOUND] turns out that CRISPR
is

14
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:54,758
the immune system in bacteria and archaea.

15
00:00:54,758 --> 00:00:59,840
[SOUND] The first step in the, the immune
system is immunization.

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,820
[NOISE] We're depicting a bacterial cell
here.

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,410
And inside the bacterial cell are cas
genes.

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,810
The cas genes encode a multi-subunit
protein called cas.

19
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:24,320
[BLANK_AUDIO]

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,508
Cas stands for CRISPR associated protein.

21
00:01:26,508 --> 00:01:35,240
Now [NOISE] what happens [NOISE] when the
cell is infected by phage?

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,500
The phage is a virus.

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,020
That injects its DNA into the bacterial
cell.

24
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,770
That DNA is thus sent to go on and do its
dirty work.

25
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,210
But if the bacterial cell survives, it's
going to use the cas

26
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,900
system to develop a memory for what
happened.

27
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,520
And what can happen is that the cas
[NOISE] system

28
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,780
will process the phage DNA into spacers.

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,665
So the spacers are actually phage
sequences.

30
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:17,609
And then that spacer is incorporated
[NOISE] into the CRISPR array.

31
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:23,160
[SOUND] So that now, that blue
sequenceappears in the array.

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,366
[SOUND] So now, the bacteria is ready just
in case it's going to be infected again.

33
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:31,862
[NOISE] So, that's the second step.

34
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:33,200
[SOUND] Which is immunity.

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,555
The CRISPR array can be transcribed into
pre CRISPR RNA.

36
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:46,583
Turns out the palindromic sequences are
cites for cleavage.

37
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:51,625
[COUGH] So, the cleavage generates crisper
RNAs and

38
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:56,880
we'll be showing you one of them, the blue
one.

39
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,539
But the others are there, as well.

40
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:07,568
The cast system [NOISE] can make cas
protein.

41
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:11,785
[SOUND]
Which associates with the CRISPR RNAs.

42
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:14,620
[SOUND]

43
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,515
Now, what happens this time if the phase
tries to infect the same bacterial cell.

44
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:27,682
[SOUND] It injects its DNA into the cell.

45
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:33,107
But this time, the CRISPR cas system

46
00:03:33,107 --> 00:03:38,532
takes that DNA [NOISE] and chews it up.

47
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:43,104
[NOISE] So, how does it do that?

48
00:03:43,104 --> 00:03:46,746
[SOUND] Well, the CRISPR RNA.

49
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:52,396
Base pairs with the phage DNA.

50
00:03:52,396 --> 00:04:00,293
[SOUND] If [NOISE] [COUGH] the phage DNA
has a sequence PAM,

51
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:08,192
which stands for proto-spacer associated
module,

52
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:14,699
then the CRISPR system will chew up the
DNA.

53
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:21,813
So I'm, on the other hand, the CRISPR

54
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:30,447
array [SOUND] itself lacks [SOUND] PAM
sequences.

55
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:39,747
[SOUND] As a result, the system doesn't
digest itself preventing autoimmunity.

56
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:49,476
[SOUND] So, the CRISPR-cas9 system [SOUND]
makes double-strand breaks in DNA.

57
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:53,069
In Streptococcus pyogenes it turns out,

58
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:58,810
that single polypeptide performs all the
cas functions, so.

59
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,940
It's a single polypeptide with multiple
pyogenes instead of multiple proteins.

60
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,669
Cas9 cutting can be directed by a single
guide RNA [SOUND] provided you do

61
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:12,288
a little genetic engineering, which we'll
talk about in a minute.

62
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:14,881
The Cas9 PAM is short.

63
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,690
It's a nucleotide followed by two Gs.

64
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:22,579
And Cas9 cuts both DNA strands.

65
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:28,758
So, I'm showing you here, the CRISPR RNA
that

66
00:05:28,758 --> 00:05:36,187
can base pair [SOUND] to the target DNA
[SOUND] which is here.

67
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:39,243
[SOUND] Now,

68
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:46,579
if the CRISPR RNA has another

69
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:53,005
RNA associated with it.

70
00:05:53,005 --> 00:05:54,632
[SOUND] A tracer RNA for

71
00:05:54,632 --> 00:05:59,890
transactivating CRISPR RNA, which base
pairs with the CRISPR RNA.

72
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,848
Then it can do its job.

73
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:07,462
And you can make this into a single RNA
[SOUND] molecule,

74
00:06:07,462 --> 00:06:09,878
by putting in a linker loop.

75
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:12,580
[SOUND] Okay?

76
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,975
So once you have all these parts ready to
go [SOUND] and

77
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:20,975
the target DNA [SOUND] includes PAM
sequences.

78
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:28,649
Then the whole thing is held together
[SOUND] by the cas9 protein.

79
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:34,972
[SOUND] To actually, cut both

80
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:41,038
strands of the target DNA.

81
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,830
[SOUND] So that's how that works.

82
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,460
[SOUND] It turns out that CRISPR-cas9 can
be delivered in a lentivirus.

83
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,350
I'm showing here [SOUND]

84
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,316
a primo, a rudimentary lentivirus with two
long terminal repeats at the end.

85
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:04,690
And pure [UNKNOWN] gene that can be used
to [SOUND] select for

86
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,690
cells that take up the lentivirus.

87
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:12,527
But the guts of the system is [SOUND] two
transcriptional cassettes.

88
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:17,390
One cassette encodes the single guide RNA.

89
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,570
[SOUND]

90
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,168
And the other cassette encodes the cas9
protein.

91
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:28,018
So the CRISPR-cas9 can make DNA
double-strand break at the target site.

92
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:32,521
Then the double strand break is repaired
by non-homologous end joining to

93
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:33,742
create a mutation.

94
00:07:33,742 --> 00:07:39,256
Or if the system is transduced with an
oligonucleotide with a very specific

95
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:45,222
sequence, hom, homologous recombination
can modify the cleaved [SOUND] site.

96
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:50,090
[SOUND] So [SOUND] how can you apply this
system?

97
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,533
You can apply this system using GeCKO.

98
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,266
What does GeCKO stand for?

99
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,496
[SOUND] GeCKO stands for

100
00:07:57,496 --> 00:08:04,310
ss genome-scale CRISPR-cas9 knock-out.

101
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:09,920
It was applied to look for resistance
against the drug Vemurafinib.

102
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,959
Turns out Vemurafinib can treat about 50%
of malignant melanomas.

103
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,000
That's amazing.

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,170
Because prior to Vemurafinib there was not
affective treatment against melanoma.

105
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,080
But the problem was the drug only works
for seven months.

106
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,200
So then resistance develops.

107
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,040
So this group was interested in trying to

108
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,770
figure out mechanisms of resist,
resistance.

109
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,440
They transduced cells with a lentiviral
CRISPR library.

110
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,520
And then they grew the cells in a
Vemurafinib defined genes that

111
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,440
when mutated conferred resistance.

112
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,090
And they found such genes, which is a very
nice demonstration [SOUND] that

113
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,920
the system can lead to new discoveries.

114
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,826
Should MDs care?

115
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:54,544
Of course.

116
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:56,262
Thank you.
