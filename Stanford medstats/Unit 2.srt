00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
[BLANK_AUDIO].

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,144
The background on the subject of medical
error is based on

3
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:17,434
the 1998 Institute of Medicine's report,
To Err is Human,

4
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:23,630
which really started the initial patient
safety move here in the United States.

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,880
In 2002, the Joint Commission formerly
known as the Joint Commission on

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,130
Accreditation of Healthcare Organization
or

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,949
JCAHO, established it's National Patient
Safety Goals or NPSGs.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,279
Implemented in 2003, National Patient
Safety Goals were required,

9
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:48,899
to help accredited organizations address
specific areas of concern in

10
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,860
regards to patient safety.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,049
The joint commission has a term called
Sentinel Event.

12
00:00:56,049 --> 00:01:00,381
It's definition is, an unexpected
occurrence involving death or

13
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:05,720
serious physical or psychological injury,
or the risk thereof.

14
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,048
Serious injury, especially including loss
of limb or function.

15
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:15,168
The phrase, or the risk thereof, includes
any process variation for which

16
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:20,310
a recurrence would carry a significant
change of serious adverse outcome.

17
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,550
Such events are called sentinel because
they signal the need for

18
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,160
immediate investigation and response.

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,060
The term sentinel event and error are not
synonymous.

20
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,624
Not all sentinel events occur because of
an error and

21
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:39,450
not all errors result in being called a
sentinel event.

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,010
The source of this information is from

23
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:48,275
the Joint Commission's Comprehensive
Accreditation Manual,ah, 2013.

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,192
Now, what are some of

25
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:56,220
the events that are considered Joint
Commission Reviewable Sentinel Events?

26
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,119
As I mentioned earlier, the event that
results in an unanticipated death or major

27
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,947
permanent loss of function, not related to
the natural course of the patient's

28
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:10,350
illness or underlying condition, or the
event is one of the following.

29
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,230
If the outcome was not death or permanent
loss of function not related to

30
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,519
the natural course of the patient's
illness or underlying condition.

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,690
These may include invasive procedure,

32
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,750
including surgery, on the wrong patient,
the wrong site, or the wrong procedure.

33
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,400
Unintended retention of foreign object in
a patient after surgery or

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,815
other invasive procedures.

35
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:42,860
[SOUND] Prolonged fluoroscopy with
cumulative doses of greater than 1500

36
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:48,533
rads to a single field or any delivery of
radiotherapy to the wrong body,

37
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:54,170
region, or greater than 25% above the
planned radiotherapy dose.

38
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,440
Hemolytic transfusion reaction involving
administration of blood or

39
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,890
blood products, having major blood group
incompatibilities.

40
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,120
That is, ABO or Rh or other blood group
types.

41
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,980
Abduction of any patient receiving care,
treatment, or services.

42
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,810
Sexual abuse, assault, including rape.

43
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,440
The National Quality Forum has developed a
Serious Reportable Event

44
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,519
definition in Healthcare.

45
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,890
In 2002, to facilitate uniform and
comparable public reporting to

46
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,580
enable systematic learnings across
healthcare organizations and systems and

47
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,060
to drive systematic national improvement
in patient safety based on what is

48
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,270
learned about, both from the events and
how to prevent their recurrence.

49
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,702
Many organizations recognize these events
as never events,

50
00:03:45,702 --> 00:03:49,870
such that they should not occur while a
patient is receiving healthcare.

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,480
The following is a list of the National
Quality Forum Serious Reportable Events.

52
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,840
They include surgical invasive procedures,
intra operative and post operative death.

53
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,659
Product or device events.

54
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,990
Patient protection events, care management
events,

55
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,710
environmental events and radiologic
events.

56
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,049
Also on the list are potential criminal
events.

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,510
The Joint Commission has been collecting
data submitted by

58
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,170
accreditor organizations since the early
2000.

59
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,460
Since those years, Joint Commission has
taken data from these submissions to

60
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,710
establish work groups to develop
recommendations that can

61
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,639
help organizations learn and prevent these
events from occurring.

62
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,732
Through the sentinel event alert
publications,

63
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:48,758
healthcare organizations, whether
accredited by Joint Commission or

64
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:52,322
not, have been able to implement solutions
that would assist in

65
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:57,070
making sure that these events do not occur
within their organization.

66
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,832
This activity has also led to the
development and implementation of

67
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:04,726
National Patient Safety Goals that are
accreditation standards that

68
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:09,750
healthcare organization must comply with,
in order to maintain their accreditation.

69
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,620
The NPSGs are program specific.

70
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,880
Which means our specific national patient
safety goals for

71
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,100
hospital, as there are specific for
ambulatory accredited organizations.

72
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,314
The information on this slide,

73
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:30,808
most frequent sentinel event reported to
joint commission between January and

74
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:37,350
July 2013, as you look at the top 10
that's been reported to Joint Commission.

75
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,949
You'll see that there are certain
commonalities and certain frequency of

76
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:47,059
events and considering that these are
voluntarily reported to Joint Commission,

77
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:51,220
you could just imagine that any one of
these events probably occur in

78
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:57,220
much greater frequency in healthcare
organizations across the United States.

79
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,070
Now, I'm going to take a few minutes here
to highlight some of

80
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,729
the hospital specific national patient
safety goals.

81
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,405
Regardless of where you practice, if you
are working in

82
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:12,805
a joint commission accredited hospital,
these standards will be enforced no matter

83
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:17,905
whether it's a United States academic
medical center, a community hospital,

84
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:22,090
Department of Defense, county, for profit,
or VA facility.

85
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,200
So, let's take a minute to review what the
current requirements are.

86
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,040
Number one, failure to utilize two patient
identifier, and

87
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,990
two independent person verification for
blood administration.

88
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,639
The need to perform medication
reconciliation.

89
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,840
You need to respond appropriately to
clinical alarms.

90
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,790
You need to perform hand hygiene.

91
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:53,614
And you need to perform proper universal
protocol from marking of procedure site

92
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:59,389
and timeout, to prevent wrong patient,
wrong side, wrong procedure events.

93
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,280
Joint Commission expects that an
organization responds to a sentinel event.

94
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,600
At a minimum, the items listed on this
slide are completed.

95
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,920
Your hospital may have additional
requirements that must be fulfilled due

96
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,470
to state laws, hospital policy, and
procedure.

97
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,060
So, starting off with the physician or
attendant,

98
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,810
should be notified that an event occurred,
but there's an expectation that

99
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:31,090
internally administration is informed of
this particular event.

100
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,040
At some point there needs to be a
notification or

101
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,300
information provided to the patient and or
their care designee.

102
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,270
There may be a need to notify certain
regulatory agencies, there is a need to

103
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:48,940
conduct a root cause analysis that it is
comprehensive and thorough.

104
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,140
And then, ultimately, a need to implement
corrective actions to

105
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,030
ensure that these things do not occur
again.

106
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,089
