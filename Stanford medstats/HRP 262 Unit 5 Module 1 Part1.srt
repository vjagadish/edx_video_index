[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,544 --> 00:00:09,730
In this next module, I'm going to talk
about what to do,

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,223
when you have competing risks.

4
00:00:12,223 --> 00:00:14,728
So, first of all, what is a competing
risk?

5
00:00:14,728 --> 00:00:19,720
A competing risk is an event that either
precludes the event of interest, or

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,467
alters its probability.

7
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:22,379
So, up until now,

8
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,970
we've been talking about, you either have
the event of interest, or you're censored.

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,570
And there's the no, nothing else in that.

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,607
And we've actually been assuming
implicitly,

11
00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:35,010
that the censoring was independent of the
event of interest.

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,780
Didn't influence your chance of having the
event of interest.

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,750
But what if there's something else that
can happen in your data set?

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,850
You can have something happen that
actually changes your probability of

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,990
having the event of interest, or prevents
it all together.

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,610
So, as a couple of examples, imagine that
what you

17
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:56,480
care about in a particular data set is
death from melanoma, a specific cancer.

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,820
But, some of the people in your data set,
this you know,

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,120
this people tend to be older.

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,710
So some of these patients actually die
from other causes.

21
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,850
Well if you die from something else, then
clearly, you are no longer at

22
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,910
risk of dying from melanoma, so that would
be a competing risk.

23
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,580
Or as another example, imagine that what
you cared about,

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,703
your event of interest was death while on
dialysis, in a kidney patients.

25
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,340
But some kidney patients,

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,730
who are having kidney failure, will go
onto get a kidney transplant.

27
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,570
And once you get a kidney transplant,
you're removed from dialysis.

28
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,690
So you can no longer die while on
dialysis.

29
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,150
So that also, the kidney transplant in
that case, would also be a competing risk.

30
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,620
What do you do in that situation, when you
have such a competing risk?

31
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,760
So, if competing risks are present, we
now, instead of having sort of

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,100
two possibilities, event or censored, we
have a third possibility.

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,180
So, we could have the event of interest.

34
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,740
You could be censored.

35
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,610
And again, up until now, we've only been
considering those two possibilities.

36
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,410
But now there's a third thing that could
happen.

37
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,390
You could have a competing risk,

38
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,400
which changes your probability of having
the event of interest.

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,800
And this is a little tricky.

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,160
You have to think about it carefully, but,
competing risk is distinct from censoring.

41
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,710
So if you think carefully,

42
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,530
if you ask the question, who failed from
the event of interest?

43
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,800
What do we know?

44
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,940
So, if somebody has had the event of
interest, so somebody, say, died from

45
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,890
melanoma, we can say for sure that yes,
they have had the event of interest.

46
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,820
We observed that for them.

47
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,730
If somebody was censored, all we know is
that up until the last time we saw them,

48
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,090
they had not have, had yet the event of
interest.

49
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,540
But, there's still, we've left of it,

50
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,840
open the possibility that sometime after
the study ended or, after we

51
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,350
lost them to follow up, they could have
gone on to have the event of interest.

52
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,830
So, the answer to this question for people
who are censored, is maybe.

53
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,160
Maybe they went on to fail from the event
of interest later.

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,218
That possibility is still open.

55
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:00,260
However, imagine you've got a competing
risk that precludes the event of interest,

56
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,660
like dying from other causes.

57
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,860
If they died from other causes, then
clearly we know for

58
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,240
sure that they certainly did not die from
melanoma.

59
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,480
So, censoring and the competing risk have
a different answer to this question.

60
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,880
The censoring, they could have gone on to
have the event, but

61
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,530
the competing risk, they could not have.

62
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,595
One of the ways that people typically
we'll handle competing risks,

63
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:25,580
is just to treat them as censored values.

64
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,880
To lump them together with the censored
individuals.

65
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,100
The problem with this, is it can run into
some trouble.

66
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,000
Especially when calculating probabilities.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,440
Because what you're essentially doing,

68
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,310
is you're treating these nos, you're
treating them as maybes.

69
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,150
You're glossing over that distinction.

70
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,270
If you treat the nos as maybes, you're
factoring into your estimate of

71
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,770
probability, that it's possible that some
of the people who got censored,

72
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,940
could have gone on to have the risk.

73
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,990
You're factoring that in, in some way in
your probabilities.

74
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,570
Because you're treating some of the nos,

75
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,990
who couldn't have gone on to have that
event of interest, as maybes, you're

76
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,690
actually going to end up overestimating
your risk of having the event of interest,

77
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,010
or equivalently underestimating your
survival probabilities.

78
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,760
And it's easiest just to illustrate this
with a few examples.

79
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,060
So, think about this melanoma data set
that you dealt with for

80
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,920
the first couple of homeworks.

81
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,720
That had actually two competing risks in
it.

82
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,080
You could die of other causes, or you
could die of melanoma.

83
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,730
And, for the purposes of the homework, to
make sure we got everything correct and

84
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,330
it was simple, I had you lump those two
causes of death together, and

85
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,680
just look at the overall probability of
survival.

86
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,870
And that's what's represented here on the
left-hand side.

87
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,729
This is just the Kaplan-Meier curve, for
the overall cohort, for overall survival.

88
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:49,915
So, about something like maybe 55% of the
cohort,

89
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:56,132
had the probability of survival somewhere
around 55% for the entire cohort.

90
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:58,342
This is a perfectly valid analysis, but

91
00:04:58,342 --> 00:05:01,680
it doesn't allow you to isolate different
causes of death.

92
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:10,100
We also sometimes call this, event-free
survival, or overall mortality.

93
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,010
Because we're indicating that you didn't
have.

94
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,820
This is the probability of having none of
the events available.

95
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,740
None of the competing risks in the data
set.

96
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,868
Now, look over on the right-hand side.

97
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:24,200
Here's the Kaplan-Meier curve that I've
drawn specifically on the top here,

98
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,100
is specifically for death from other
causes.

99
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,250
[SOUND]
And I've lumped together people who

100
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,410
died of melanoma, in the censored people,
for this Kaplan-Meier curve.

101
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,770
So, everybody who died of melanoma is
counted as censored for

102
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,220
this Kaplan-Meier curve.

103
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,600
And on the bottom here, I'm showing the
Kaplan-Meier curve from,

104
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,890
for death from melanoma specifically.

105
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:54,240
And in that cure, I've treated people who
died of other causes as censored.

106
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,180
And let's just look actually at the five
year survival probabilities.

107
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,260
A lot of times with cancer,

108
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,580
we're very interested in the five year
survival probabilities,

109
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,150
those are often what people will cite.

110
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,580
So, if you look at the survival
probability for the overall survival,

111
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,380
it's about, somewhere around 75%, and I've
specifically gotten the actual numbers.

112
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,900
It was exactly a 26.8% chance of dying.

113
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,890
That's the overall failure probability.

114
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,770
So I'm going to talk now about the failure
probabilities.

115
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,630
Your chances of dying in five years was
26.8%.

116
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,540
Chances of survival, of course, would be 1
minus that.

117
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,020
That's, and this is the valid analysis on
the, on the left-hand side.

118
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,630
When we do the Kaplan-Meier, when we're
censoring the competing event [INAUDIBLE]

119
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,740
you're going to see that something funny
happens.

120
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,310
So, if we look at the five year survival
on death from other causes, it was,

121
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,990
only a low number of people had died, but
there was a 4.7% chance of dying,

122
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,140
from other causes according to this
Kaplan-Meier curve.

123
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,470
And then, if you looked specifically at
the melanoma-specific five year

124
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,630
survival rates, the chances of dying,

125
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,470
the survival probability's about 77% and
the chance of dying specifically from

126
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,646
melanoma as projected on this Kaplan-Meier
curve was 23.1%, but

127
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:17,150
you'll notice something interesting,
there's two ways to die in this data set.

128
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,680
You can die from other causes, or you can
die from melanoma,

129
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,040
those are mutually exclusive, and it
covers all possible ways of dying.

130
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,830
So it should be case that if we add up the
probability of dying from other causes,

131
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,300
plus the probability of dying from
melanoma,

132
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,300
that should equal the total probability of
dying.

133
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,630
But notice that it doesn't add up here.

134
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:45,210
So if I do 4.7% plus 23.1%, I actually get
a, a total probability of 27.8%.

135
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,700
It's slightly different, than the 26.8%
that we got for the overall survival.

136
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,450
So, something's funny here,

137
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,610
because they're not adding up in the way
that they should.

138
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,302
And this difference isn't so huge, but
it's, I mean it should add up exactly, and

139
00:07:58,302 --> 00:08:01,154
so that the fact that there's any
difference is problematic.

140
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:04,829
But yeah, just to give you an even more
humorous example or

141
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:09,779
more kind of dramatic example here is an
example from the literature, and

142
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:15,511
if you look at the overall serv the, this
is the cardiovascular mortalities.

143
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:19,487
So if you look at just Kaplan, this, this
is a Kaplan-Meier curve on the left-hand

144
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:23,619
side for cardiovascular mortality dying
from some heart disease related cause.

145
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:25,815
The survival probability is estimated for

146
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:29,170
the whole study is estimated to be about
50% in this low group.

147
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,793
And the low group is just, they divided
the study subjects into three groups based

148
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:37,947
on a blood biomarker, if we just look
specifically at the low group,

149
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:42,763
then the chances of dying in that low
group of heart disease was about 50%.

150
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:46,393
But what's interesting if you go on and
look at the low group, for

151
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,297
non-cardiovascular mortality on the right
here,

152
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:53,790
it turns out that this is somewhere around
44 or 45% survival probability.

153
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,090
So, one minus that will give you the
probability of death,

154
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,974
which turns out to be about 55% or 56%
chance of dying From non-cardiovascular,

155
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,053
and from, from something other than heart
disease.

156
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:07,773
Now, again you should be able to add these
up and

157
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:10,670
get the total probability of dying at all.

158
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,310
And if you have a 50% chance of dying of
heart disease, and

159
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,250
a 50% chance of dying of things that
aren't heart disease.

160
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,760
That should sum up, but that would say
that you have a 105% chance of dying,

161
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,700
which of course is clearly impossible.

162
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,380
So, something is wrong with treating the
competing risk as censored.

163
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,444
You get the wrong probabilities.

164
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,580
[SOUND]

165
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,390
And in fact, here is the overall all cause
mortality graph.

166
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,330
And what you'll notice,

167
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,400
is that in fact in the low group, in fact
they had about a 15% chance of surviving.

168
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,020
So they had about an 85% chance of dying.

169
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,860
So certainly, that's very different than
105 or 106% chance.

170
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,010
And obviously, anything above 100% is, is
impossible.

171
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,230
So this is just a really extreme example.

172
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,600
And you can see that some other authors
kind of pointed out this error.

173
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,682
And they actually did a nice little table
here, which shows you at the one year,

174
00:10:03,682 --> 00:10:06,190
the three year, and the five year
follow-ups.

175
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,110
The all cause mortality values are valid,
from the Kaplan-Meier curves.

176
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,900
But if you calculate separately, using
Kaplan-Meier methods.

177
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,930
With the competing risk treated as
censored.

178
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,370
You'll notice that if I get the heart
disease mortality, and

179
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,100
the non-heart disease mortality, and I add
those up.

180
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,090
Those ought to su, sum up to the total
mortality.

181
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,810
But they don't, in any of these cases.

182
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,630
And in some of these cases, you can see
that the gap is quite large.

183
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,610
Obviously, again, you can't have more than
100% chance of dying either.
