00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,470
Hello, students.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,890
Today we will learn how to analyze gene
expression data sets when the data

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,080
sets are very large.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,220
In fact, we want to analyze gene
expression across the entire genome.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,680
On approach is unsupervised analysis.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,090
You may already know something about your
samples.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,180
But unsupervised analysis doesn't use the
information.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,739
Instead, it simply looks at the data
without any preconceptions.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,140
One example of unsupervised analysis is
called hierarchical clustering.

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,540
Imagine they chopped data from two
samples, X and Y.

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,440
The data are the levels of expression for
four genes.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,053
And suppose the level of expression for

13
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:48,221
gene one in sample one in sample X is X1,
and

14
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:53,270
its level of expression in sample Y is Y1.

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:00,150
Similarly for gene two, it's X2 in

16
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,710
sample X and Y2 in sample Y.

17
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:10,780
And so on and so forth for this toy
example for genes three and four.

18
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,910
Now, it looks like something is going on
here, and in fact, that there is.

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,040
And that's something can

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,880
be measured by what's called the Pearson
Correlation Coefficient.

21
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,110
R [INAUDIBLE]
of X and Y.

22
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,410
And it's given by this formula.

23
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,270
And what the Pearson correlation
coefficient will do is give you

24
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,830
a value between plus one and minus one.

25
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,245
So, for perfect correlation R is 1.0.

26
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:42,270
For absolutely now correction is zero.

27
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:48,100
And, for anti correlation, where say the
level of expression if it's low

28
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,160
in sample X, it's always high in sample Y
and, and so on.

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,246
The R value is minus one.

30
00:01:55,246 --> 00:02:00,774
Now, I've given you some examples here of
R values for examples with

31
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:07,081
many more data points, and these R values
go from plus one, down to minus one.

32
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:12,298
And you can see the R values of 0.8 and
0.4 show correlation that gets

33
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,833
progressively weaker down to R value of
zero, and

34
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:20,991
then anti-correlation from minus 0.4 to
minus 0.8 to minus one.

35
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:21,610
'Kay.

36
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,290
How does this play out?

37
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,113
Well.

38
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:29,620
Suppose now, you have three samples X, Y,
and Z,

39
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,380
and you calculate the Pearson correlation
coefficient between each pair of samples.

40
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,770
So you get values between X and Y of 0.2,
X and

41
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,380
Z of 0.8, and between Y and Z of -0.6.

42
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,470
The most highly correlated samples here
are X and Z.

43
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,390
So, I've put them together here in this
example and

44
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,600
to express that you want to draw.

45
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,317
You can draw a diagram that will allow you
to show graphically

46
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:04,080
what's happening, and you can see that X
and

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,140
Z are linked by two short branches on a
tree, and the branches go up to .8.

48
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,560
What about sample Y?

49
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,200
Well, you really want to know the
correlation between sample Y and

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,690
the mini cluster of X and Z.

51
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,020
One way of doing that is by using the
already calculated values

52
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:30,210
of the correlation between Y and Z which
is minus 0.6 and

53
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,550
between Y and X which is 0.2, and

54
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:40,050
take the average of those two numbers, to
give you minus 0.2.

55
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:48,740
And then, you can take that number and
draw a tree,

56
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,640
extend the tree diagram [SOUND]

57
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,016
to show the relationship between sample Y
and

58
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:02,750
the mini-cluster X and Z.

59
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,530
And, you can do the same thing with
additional samples, say, for

60
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,430
X prime and so on.

61
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,130
Okay.

62
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,650
So here's an example of real data.

63
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,140
[COUGH]

64
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,180
This shows samples going across the top
and genes going across the bottom.

65
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,439
And you can see a tree diagram showing
decreasing correlation.

66
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:29,880
In addition, I have to let you know that
the genes are also clustered.

67
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,800
Okay.

68
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,400
So now let's take a look at these samples.

69
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,480
We've kept track of what they are,

70
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,280
we've just allowed hierarchical clustering
to do its thing without any supervision.

71
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,500
So in yellow here are a bunch of samples,
for example from chronic lymphocytic

72
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,108
leukemia, and green here are a bunch of
sample from follicular lymphoma.

73
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:59,800
In a addition, the largest group of
samples [SOUND]

74
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,560
In blue here come from

75
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,265
an entity called diffuse large B cell
lymphoma.

76
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,270
And you can see that the clustering isn't
perfect, but it's pretty darn good.

77
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:22,240
All the samples that we know biologically
should be similar [UNKNOWN] are together.

78
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,670
Although it's not perfect, there are few
samples of

79
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:31,410
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that have
gone elsewhere in the tree diagram.

80
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:37,390
Now, in conversely, the diffuse large
B-cell

81
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:42,810
lymphoma samples are mixed with samples
that came

82
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:50,685
from germinal center, GC, B-cells.

83
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:51,971
Okay.

84
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:57,265
And indeed, a few of the samples among the
diffuse large

85
00:05:57,265 --> 00:06:00,470
B-cell lymphomas look like germinal center
B-cells.

86
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:06,180
And you can see that not all of them do,
so that what this heirchical clustering

87
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,310
has done is discovered that diffuse large
B-cell lymphomas are heterogeneous,

88
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,650
that some of them are germinal center
type,

89
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,212
and some of them are non-germinal center
type.

90
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:24,650
And then you can begin to do things that
are medically relevant.

91
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,300
So let's move on.

92
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,940
A second approach is to use supervised
analysis.

93
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,050
Supervised analysis looks at the data with
supervision.

94
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,740
You have information about your samples,

95
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,550
and supervised analysis uses that
information.

96
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,950
Suppose you have two classes of samples.

97
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,520
Thing one and thing two.

98
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,710
Supervised analysis will find the genes
with expression profiles that

99
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,690
differ between thing one and thing two.

100
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,260
An example of how this is done is the
method known as

101
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,450
Significant Analysis of Microarray or SAM.

102
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,640
Now, thing 1 and thing 2 could be samples
from Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma and

103
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,250
Follicular Lymphoma, or they could be
samples from cells before and

104
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,110
after exposure to ionizing radiation, etc.

105
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,613
And you're going to look for

106
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:20,210
genes,specifically, that are specifically
different between Thing 1 and Thing 2.

107
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:26,450
And here you see such a gene.

108
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,800
And then you find another one down here.

109
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,780
That's interesting, that's one such gene.

110
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,450
That's green, green, green, red, red, red.

111
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,170
The other one was red, red, red, green,
green, green.

112
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,310
And you look some more and oh, low and

113
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,970
behold here's another one green, green,
green, red, red, red.

114
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,126
And you get really excited.

115
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:50,616
You've discovered

116
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:57,360
three genes, but how reliable is that
discovery?

117
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,910
You could do the experiment over and over
again and

118
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,170
see if you keep getting the same answer.

119
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,320
But that's very expensive.

120
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,240
Instead you can do something called
permutation analysis.

121
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,130
And that is to make nonsensical
categories.

122
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:17,090
You'll call one set of genes T one and T
two, for example.

123
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,120
And of course the way you do this is you
take one of the samples from

124
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:34,050
Thing 2, say this one, and you move it
over to Thing 1, over here.

125
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:44,940
And you take one of the samples from thing
one and

126
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:51,230
you move it over here and call it T two.

127
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,450
So these are nonsensical categories.

128
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,840
And then you look for genes that might be
doing something between nonsensical

129
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,500
categories, and you see, look at that,
green, green, green, red, red, red.

130
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,680
And you can do this again, and call,

131
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,455
make some more nonsensical categories, say
top one and

132
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:18,700
top two and look for genes, and there's
one, green, green, green, red, red, red.

133
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,170
Now this allows you to calculate what's
called the false discovery rate.

134
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:30,070
If you get an average, say, of one gene
from nonsensical categories and

135
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,080
three discovered genes from the real
experiment.

136
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,787
So the false discovery rate is one out of
three.

137
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:42,960
[SOUND]
Or 33%.

138
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,950
In practice, we set our cutoffs to

139
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,150
achieve false subscribery rates much lower
than this, say 5%, 2%, or 1%.

140
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,740
So how does this play out in real life?

141
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,670
Well, here's some real data.

142
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,610
This is data from small, blue, round-cell
tumors,

143
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,590
which pretty much look the same under the
microscope.

144
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:07,020
And, the supervised analysis was done to
find a set of

145
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,710
genes that distinguish these tumors from
each other.

146
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,368
The tumors that are shown here are all
small, round, blue-celled tumors.

147
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,380
But they're Burkitt's Lymphoma in this
category, and Ewing's Sarcoma

148
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:29,598
in this category, and neuroblastoma in
this category, and

149
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:36,500
rhabdomyosarcoma in this category.

150
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,680
And there are a total of 43 genes that are
differentially expressed and

151
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,430
actually distinguish these categories from
each other.

152
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,140
Now, within each category, the data has
been organized by hierarchical clustering,

153
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,420
so that you can see whether there's any
variation among the tumors.

154
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:01,320
So there you have it, how to analyze gene
expression across the entire genome.

155
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,220
We've talked about two types of methods,
unsupervised methods,

156
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,450
example of which is hierarchical
clustering.

157
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,110
That's an exploration without fore
knowledge that seeks out

158
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,410
new hypotheses somewhat akin to Captain
Kirk.

159
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,650
These are the voyages of the Starship
Enterprise.

160
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,310
Its five year mission to explore strange
new worlds.

161
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,490
To seek out new life and new
civilizations.

162
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,850
To boldly go where no man has gone before.

163
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,350
The second type of method that we've
studied are the supervised methods.

164
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,530
One example of which is significance
analysis of microarrays.

165
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,390
That's a study with foreknowledge that
identifies differences between

166
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,280
sample classes.
