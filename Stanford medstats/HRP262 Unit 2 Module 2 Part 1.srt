[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,920
In this next module, I'm going to talk
about two probability distributions that

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,360
are often used in survival analysis, the
Exponential and the Weibull.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,109
It turns out that survival times often
follow one of those distributions.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,420
So, to build up to talking about the
Exponential and

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,050
the Weibull, I'm actually going to start
with the hazard function.

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,140
Every probability distribution has a
hazard function and

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,180
I think it's easier if we start by
defining the hazard function here And

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:40,360
then I'll show you how that leads to
particular probability density function.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,310
So, the hazard function as I mentioned
earlier,

11
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,040
is the instantaneous incidence rate.

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,720
If the probability that if you survive up
to a particular time, event free,

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,460
you haven't had the event yet, it's the
probability that you're going to have

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,600
the event in the next, instant and
probably the pregnancy data that we've

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,650
talked about earlier is a good example of,
for kind of

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,660
putting this into words because women can
only get pregnant once in a given month.

17
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,860
So for that pregnancy data we talked about
earlier,

18
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,740
it would be the probability that if a
woman is,

19
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,430
has remained as still not pregnant at the
beginning of a given month,

20
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,410
it's the probability that she's going to
get pregnant within that next month.

21
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,590
So, that's what we mean by a hazard
function.

22
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,070
We can define it mathematically for those
of you who like this kind of case,

23
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,230
it's just saying this is in, the
mathematical terms.

24
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,220
If you like that words though, the
probability that again, if you survive up

25
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,200
until a time t, that you will succumb to
the event in the very next instant.

26
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,870
And lemmie just review some potential
hazard functions.

27
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,260
What might hazard functions look like?

28
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,760
Well, the most obvious one is that maybe
the hazard function would just be

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,140
constant over time.

30
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,530
That makes a lot of sense with something
like the pregnancy data where it's

31
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,320
probably the case that a woman's
probability of getting pregnant in

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,510
any particular month is pretty constant
from month to month.

33
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,450
So we could say that the hazard function,
and the way I'm going to represent

34
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,440
the hazard function is I'm always going to
right it as h of t.

35
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,620
All that little t is in there to remind
you that the hazard function itself is

36
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,090
a function of t, and it might change over
time.

37
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,260
Now in the instance and when the example
where it's constant over time, then

38
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,970
the hazard function will just be equal to
the same thing, regardless of time.

39
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,040
And, so, it's going to be equal to some
constant, which I'm calling here c.

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,840
c stands for constant.

41
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,030
So it could be constant over time, and

42
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,150
that makes a se, sense with a lot of types
of data,

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,170
that the hazard rate is roughly the same
from month to month or year to year.

44
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,100
That's the simplest case.

45
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,290
However, you could imagine scenarios where

46
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,170
the hazard function is increasing over
time.

47
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,270
Maybe it's not constant but

48
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,650
it's increasing in some predictable way
over time.

49
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,220
So a very simple function where the hazard
would be increasing over time is,

50
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,360
is c times t.

51
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,830
So this means that the hazard would be a
function of time.

52
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,590
And as time goes up the hazard function
goes up.

53
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,510
A little bit more general than that we
could define hazard function,

54
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,070
which was c, some constant, times time
raised to a power.

55
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:14,280
If that power was greater than 0, then t,
there's going to be some, you know,

56
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,290
we're multiplying by something greater
than 0, then,

57
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,690
so this is going to be an increasing
function.

58
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,420
And if k is equal to 1, then we would be
back on this c times t.

59
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,660
So I can draw a little picture here, so if
here's time and here's my hazard function,

60
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,715
which is a function of time, yes, we are
equal to the first one, c times t, it's

61
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:40,880
going to look like that as we go across
time, the hazard function increases.

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,530
And we don't have to have it increase so
quietly so steeply, so

63
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,360
the second equation allows us to have

64
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,490
the hazard function increase less steeply
over time something more like that.

65
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,070
You can also imagine in scenarios where
the hazard function

66
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,050
decreases in some predictable ways.

67
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,770
For example if you had a constant but were
dividing by time and

68
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,830
as time got bigger, as you went further in
time, the hazard rate is going to go down.

69
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,512
Or you can again have a more general
equation which has a constant time

70
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:13,240
raised to some power.

71
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,830
If that power is negative that puts t in
the denominator and

72
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,580
again overtime the hazard function would
be decreasing.

73
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,320
I told another possibility which is often
the case of real data is that

74
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,430
perhaps the hazard function doesn't have a
smooth mathematical function.

75
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,280
So you can some scenario, I'm just making
this up.

76
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,730
But here is time, here is the hazard
function.

77
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,370
There's nothing that says that it has to
follow a nice smooth function.

78
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,850
With real you know,

79
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,860
things in life, perhaps the hazard
function looks something like that,

80
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,960
some weird squiggly thing that's too hard
to define mathematically.

81
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,680
So we're going to see that eventually when
we get to cox regression.

82
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,590
We are going to try to avoid specifying
any particular destination for

83
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,490
the hazard function because of the fact
that often times it doesn't

84
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,600
follow something that we can easily
estimate mathematically.

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,210
So just keep that in the back of your
mind.

86
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,420
This week we are talking about parametric
regression,

87
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,710
trying to actually estimate that hazard
function, but eventually we may try to,

88
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,610
want to try to avoid estimating it and,
and giving it any

89
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,820
particular mathematical form and that's
what cox regression does for next week.

90
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,250
Alright, so, I now just kind of want to go
through an example to

91
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,620
show you how How this works.

92
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,080
When the hazard function is constant what
does that tell us about survival times?

93
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,900
For the pregnancy data, we have this
pregnancy data that I

94
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,252
showed you last week, some women who had
sub-frudoil or

95
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:40,190
sub-frutile they were given some treatment
they were followed over 2 years.

96
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,320
When we look at that data,

97
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:47,450
we cal, we calculate an average incidence
rate of 10.4% per month.

98
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,790
In other words, about 10.4%of women who
were at

99
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,640
risk of getting pregnant in any given
month, got pregnant.

100
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,280
Now, for the purposes of just making this,
really, a really simple calculation.

101
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,650
What I'm going to say is that we imagine
we have a case where the hazard rate is

102
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,970
a con, a constant.

103
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:08,389
And, it's equal to .1 at 10% chance per
month, .1 chance of pregnancy per month.

104
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,110
So, if I were to tell you that every woman
has a 10% chance of getting pregnant in

105
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,060
a given month if she, obviously if she's
not already pregnant, and I were to say,

106
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,000
what's the chance that a woman is going to
survive pregnancy free, she's going to

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,720
make it to 6 months without becoming
pregnant or you could equivalently ask

108
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,940
what's the chance that she's going to get
pregnant within the first 6 months?

109
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,740
Your instincts looking at this 10% might
be to do the following.

110
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,810
You might say okay well I want to know the
chance she's going to get

111
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,350
pregnant within 6 months so I'm going to
say she has a 10% chance every month.

112
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,940
I'm going to multiply that by 6 and I'm
going to say that her probability of

113
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:53,340
getting pregnant within 6 months or less
is equal to,

114
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,130
I'm going to say she has a 60% chance of
getting pregnant and therefore her chances

115
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,970
of the pregnancy taking greater than 6
months is equal to 40%.

116
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,560
That would be kind of you're first guess.

117
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,310
That actually wouldn't be quite correct
though and

118
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,410
I'm going to show you that, why, why that
is now.

119
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,220
You can't just multiply like that because
when you multiply like that,

120
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,800
you forget the fact that every month some
women are getting pregnant.

121
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,960
And that changes the denominator, so let
me illustrate that now.

122
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,850
So this again might, might be your first
instinct, but

123
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,580
it would actually not be correct.

124
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,325
So let's just do a little math out here.

125
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:28,110
[BLANK_AUDIO]

126
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,764
I want to calculate the probability that a
women gets pregnant within 6 months or

127
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:36,290
1 minus half the probability that she
survives pregnancy three past 6

128
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,504
months if the hazard rate is a constant
10% per month.

129
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:44,690
So, I gotta write down the time, the
hazard,

130
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,630
the number of women at risk of getting
pregnant, once you're pregnant already,

131
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,570
you can't, you have no chance of pregnant
again that's why you have been,

132
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,340
within once you're already pregnant, until
of course that baby is born.

133
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,500
And, incident pregnancies.

134
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,330
I am just going to make this little table,

135
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,068
I think it is easier to keep track of
things, and then women left.

136
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,260
Okay, so here we go.

137
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,330
So, first month happens.

138
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,950
Let's start, to make this really easy
we'll start with 100 women.

139
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,050
So we're make, we're going to put whole
numbers to then start with 100 women.

140
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,210
So, at time point one, the first month of
the study, the hazard rate is 10%.

141
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,750
I'm going to write it as a percent to make
this really easy.

142
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,150
The number of women at risk at that point,
time point is 100.

143
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,080
How many are then going to get pregnant?

144
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,680
Well, we start with 100 women, about 10%
are going to get pregnant so

145
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,960
we are expecting about 10 pregnancies that
month.

146
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,700
How many women are then left and are now
at risk of pregnancy?

147
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,890
Only 90, so 100 minus 10.

148
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,490
Time .2, the hazard rate is still 10%.

149
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,770
We have a constant hazard, so everybody
who's not pregnant now still has a 10% of

150
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,770
chance of getting pregnant in month two.

151
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,080
How many women are at risk now?

152
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,790
Only 90, because some already got
pregnant.

153
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,330
This is what I mean about the denominators
changing.

154
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,030
How many incident pregnancies are we
going to expect?

155
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,860
So how many women are going to get
pregnant then roughly in month two?

156
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,510
Well 10% of 90 is 9.

157
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,780
So we're not expecting 10 to get pregnant
in that month.

158
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,370
But 9, because some of the women have
already gotten pregnant.

159
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,520
That leaves 81 women left.

160
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,730
We go to time point 3 again, the hazard is
still 10%,

161
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,770
we have a constant hazard makes the
problem easy the number of women,

162
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:22,990
at risk is 81, while 10% of 81 is about 8,
we're going to just rounding here for

163
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:30,440
ease, to make the point, so 81 minus 8
we'll give us that we have 73 women

164
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,792
left who are still at risk of becoming
pregnant,8 more have gotten pregnant.

165
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:39,540
Time .4, same hazard rate, 73 women at
risk.

166
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,220
How many pregnancies are we then
expecting?

167
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,470
Well, 10% of 73 is about 7, again, I'm
just going to round for simplicity here.

168
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,040
That leaves us with 66 women who are still
not pregnant.

169
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,095
Time .5, 10%, we're at 66 women.

170
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:00,910
10% of 66 is about 7, I'm rounding again a
little bit so

171
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:06,740
that's going to leave me with about 59
women

172
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,160
who are not, sorry, 59 women who are not
pregnant.

173
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,811
And I'm going to keep going here [COUGH]
to month six.

174
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:20,300
10% hazard, 59 women are not pregnant,
about 6 of them will get pregnant,

175
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,430
so about 10%, that leaves me with a
probability of 50,

176
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,330
that leaves me with 53 women who are not
pregnant.

177
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:32,640
So notice now that the probability of
getting pregnant within 6 months is

178
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,650
not equal to 60%, which might have been
your instinct here.

179
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,798
It's actually only equal to 47%,

180
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:43,620
because there is a 47 women out of a 100
who got pregnant within 6 months.

181
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,180
So the probability of not getting
pregnant.

182
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,880
If the pregnancy taking greater than 6
months.

183
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,940
That's kind of our trivial probability
here.

184
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,960
It's 53%.

185
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,020
You had a 53% chance of it taking longer
than 6 months here.

186
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,510
So it's a little counterintuitive, you
kind of have to work it out.

187
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,080
But what I've just illustrated for

188
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,950
you is actually why we're on an
exponential distribution when the,

189
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,020
hazard function is constant, we end up on
an exponential distribution and

190
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,790
that's because the denominators every time
are shrinking as I've shown you here.

191
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,440
So, it turns out when the hazard function
is constant, we are on an exponential.

192
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,830
Remember this number the probability of
surviving pregnancy for

193
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,230
any past 6 months is about 53% and I've
rounded a lot here so

194
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,240
this is going to be a very rounded number,
but I'll show you that when we

195
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,860
pretend we're on an exponential, or we say
we're on an exponential and

196
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,500
I use the formulas for an exponential, it
will spit out the same answer.

197
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,640
So it turns out when the, the hazard rate
is constant, we are on an exponential.

198
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,170
Now the exponential distribution is
actually a family of distributions because

199
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,510
the parameter h changes how steep the
curve is.

200
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,230
You can have various steep exponential
curves that drop really fast, or you can

201
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,460
have very shallow exponential curves which
don't drop as fast, and that all

202
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,850
depends on the value of h, how the hazard
rate, how fast events are occurring.

203
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,970
The probability density function for a, an
exponential is the following.

204
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,980
h, your hazard rate, your constant hazard
rate

205
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,090
The exponential function raised to
negative ht, t here being time.

206
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,100
So that's the probability function if you
wanted to say,

207
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,980
what's the probability of having the event
in any particular month?

208
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,680
So for the pregnancy example, if I wanted
to say, what's the probability that

209
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,250
a woman is going to get pregnant in
exactly at, during the 7 month exactly and

210
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,940
that's a funny question to ask but you
know, if she wants to know she is

211
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,425
going to get pregnant during that 7
months, what's the probability of,

212
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:38,410
of that specific time point being, when
she gets pregnant.

213
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,570
That's what we mean by a probability
density function.

214
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,618
Once we know we are on an exponential,

215
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:46,720
we can also define a cumulative
distribution function.

216
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,500
So the cumulative distributive function is
a,

217
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,810
a calculated by taking the inner growth
from 0 to t.

218
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:58,690
So what's the chance on a particular curve
that I, that takes,

219
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,270
so for example what's the chance that it,
that, you know, I'm going to get pregnant.

220
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,930
What's the probability that I'm going to
get pregnant within 6 months?

221
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,700
So we've put he was 6 months here.

222
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,550
I can calculate if I know I'm on an
exponential,

223
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,620
I can figure out that the cumulative
distribution function.

224
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,980
I'm doing out the calculus here for you,
you don't need to do out the calculus, but

225
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,720
for those of you who are curious, I take
the integral from 0 to t,

226
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,860
t being the time that I want to know
about,

227
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,130
when I take that integral I can show that
cumulative distribution function for

228
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,632
an exponential has the general form 1
minuse raised to negative h and

229
00:13:30,632 --> 00:13:34,620
then t plug in whatever time you are
interested in.

230
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,660
So for example, 6 months.

231
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,300
So if you just apply that here.

232
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,060
Remember for this pregnancy data, we said,

233
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:44,948
well, what's the probability that I get
pregnant within 6 months?

234
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,789
You can just apply the cdf if we know that
the pregnancy is constant at point one,

235
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,870
10% chance per month.

236
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,650
We can just apply the cdf formula here to
get probability,

237
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:00,030
rather than us having to do out all the
math like I just did on a previous slide.

238
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,190
So if we just apply 1 minus e raise to
negative.

239
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,290
Now the houser right here is point 1 per
month.

240
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,100
And then we have to make sure we enter
time in months which we're going to at

241
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,260
six months.

242
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,410
We would just plug into that formula.

243
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,358
So if I do 1 minus e raise to negative .6.

244
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:18,580
[BLANK_AUDIO]

245
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,600
So when we calculate this out, this turns
out to be right around 45%.

246
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,580
So not exactly what we got before because
of course we

247
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,470
were doing a bunch of rounding there, but
right about that.

248
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,340
So, we had found about 43%, about a 45%
chance of

249
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,680
getting pregnant within 6 months, and then
what we're usually interested in

250
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,610
when we're doing survival analysis is
actually the survival function.

251
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,320
So the survival function is just the area
to the right, what's the chance of,

252
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,820
not getting pregnant within the first 6
months of it happening, after that

253
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,700
instead of that's just going to be 1 minus
the cumulative density function.

254
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,520
So it's easy to just subtract 1 minus the
cdf and

255
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,128
you can show that that's equal to e raised
to the negative ht, so again if we plug-in

256
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:10,648
to that e raised to the negative 1 times
6, well that's just

257
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:15,300
going to be 1 minus what we calculated on
the previous page, it's right about 55%.

258
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,810
So again women have, the constant hazard
rate,

259
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:23,568
is 10% per month, there's a 55% chance of
surviving pregnancy,

260
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:27,410
free of not getting pregnant within the
first 6 months.

261
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,740
So that's an exponential function, and
just to show you all of

262
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,640
these together the hazard, the probability
density function, the cumulative density

263
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,940
function and the survival function, all as
functions of time.

264
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,840
I've made graphs where we have a constant
hazard of .1,

265
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,390
just to show you what these all look like.

266
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,150
So the hazard function is here in this
upper left hand panel, so

267
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,910
the hazard function is constant over time,
it doesn't change over time.

268
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,420
That translates to a pdf, a probability
density function,

269
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,380
that looks like an exponential, because
we're on an exponential.

270
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,500
It's not a terribly steep one.

271
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,130
It's a rather shallow exponential.

272
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,610
That corresponds to a cumulative density
function that looks like this,

273
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,220
where women are becoming pregnant and you
can see that at 6 months,

274
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,470
you know, not quite half our pregnant yet,
but if we were to keep going we

275
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,900
would expect about 90% of the women to be
pregnant by about two years.

276
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,250
And then, finally the survival probability
is just like a Kaplan Meier curve,

277
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,820
that's what we're trying to estimate when
we do a Kaplan Meier curve.

278
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,820
And you can see that this is the chances
of remaining pregnancy free or

279
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,060
event free and that one again drops.

280
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,970
It's kind of a complement of the cdf.

281
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,020
So this is just to show you that once you
know one of them, if you know the hazard

282
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,250
then you'll know the pdf, the cdf, and the
survival probability.

283
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,430
You can, you can know the functions for
all of them.

284
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,990
When we do parametric regression, what
we're actually going to be estimating.

285
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,380
Our regressions equation is going to be
centered around the hazard function But

286
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,010
often, and what we want to generate is a
survival function, a survival curve.
