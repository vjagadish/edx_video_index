00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:06,890
Hello students we will learn about the
quantitative chain reaction or QPCR.

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,610
This measures the amount of target DNA in
the sample it does this by

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,990
measuring fluorescence production by
magnification of the target DNA.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,590
What makes QPCR go well you need the usual
PCR reagents.

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,360
DNA, primers, DNTPs, DNA polymerase and

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,230
thermal cycling, but you'll also need an
extra ingredient.

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:35,770
One example of that extra ingredient is
the intercalating dye, SYBR-Green.

8
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,369
This is how SYBR-Green works.

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,910
In free solution it does not glow.

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:48,540
In the presence of double stranded DNA
however the SYBR

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,560
green will interrelate in the DNA and glow
green.

12
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,250
SYBR green does not interact.

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,290
With single stranded DNA such as the DNA
in the, all the nuclei type primers, so,

14
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,270
in the presence of the primers, it will
not go green,

15
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,940
it will only go green in the presence of
double stranded DNA, so

16
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,229
this is how the SYBR green strategy
works,.

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,910
Look up here, we've got a solution of SYBR
green, and

18
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:23,440
as we amplify our target DNA, the SYBR
green has an opportunity

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,160
to intercalate and glow green, and as we
get more DNA.

20
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,240
The saccharine has more opportunities, to
intercalate and pro-create.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,620
So the saccharine will, is an indicator
for

22
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,640
how much double stranded DNA is being
amplified.

23
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,300
Now, there's another strategy.

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,755
That uses, a reporter oligonucleotide.

25
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:57,010
[NOISE] And this reporter oligonucleotide.

26
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:02,400
Is complimentary to the target DNA, and
will hybridize, but

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,140
it's specially constructed so that one
nucleotide on the reporter contains

28
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:14,330
a quencher, and another nucleotide on the
reporter contains a fluorescent dye.

29
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,280
Because the flourecent dye is close to the
quencher it fails to glow.

30
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,840
But on release from the oligonucleotide it

31
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,790
is no longer close to the quencher and it
can glow red so here's how.

32
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,980
The reporter of the nucleotide works.

33
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:42,630
Suppose we have the target DNA, and we
have a.

34
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,760
Poly oligonucleotide.

35
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,840
In addition to that, suppose, the reporter
oligonucleotide also,

36
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,600
finds, to the target DNA.

37
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:10,340
DNA polymerase comes along, and bumps into
the re, reporter oligonucleotide.

38
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,100
The DNA polymerase that's used in the
reaction in addition to

39
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,290
having a five prime to three prime
polymerase activity also has a five prime

40
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,210
to three prime exo nucleus activity.

41
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:27,760
So as a result, the polymerase

42
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:38,290
can chew through the reporter
oligonucleotide,

43
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,550
releasing the reporter oligonucleotide.

44
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:47,680
First, releasing the oligonucleotide bound
to the fluorescent dye but

45
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,520
now that's free and no longer near the
clincher, and

46
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:59,039
then it releases, the other single
nucleotides.

47
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:07,080
Until it reaches the quencher which is no
longer close

48
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,580
to the fluorescent dye and therefore
unable to quench it, and as you,

49
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:19,680
go through multiple cycles of PCR, there
are more and more opportunities for

50
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,570
reporter oligonucleotide to hybridize to
the target DNA,

51
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,600
and more and more opportunities for it to
release its fluorescent dye.

52
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:38,030
So, the either of these strategies capable
of,

53
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,950
reporting on the amount of DNA in any one
of several reactions.

54
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:49,160
So you can search around for say a plate
with lots of wells so

55
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,720
you can do lots of experimenting in
parallel.

56
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,790
And look, down here.

57
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,770
Here is a 96 well plate.

58
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,810
Well I'm going to use it and put a whole
bunch of reactions into the 96 well plate,

59
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,860
and each reaction is somewhat different,
and I expect each reaction

60
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,450
will have different amounts of the target
DNA.

61
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:20,900
So if I were using SYBR green for example
some of

62
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,108
the samples will glow a bright green and
other samples.

63
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:30,470
Glow less brightly indicating different

64
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,500
concentrations of the target DNA in each
well.

65
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,510
And there is a way of doing this that
allows you to be very quantitative.

66
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:44,000
Here's an example of QPCR data for five
different samples.

67
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,780
Each sample was run in triplicate so for
example.

68
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,660
The green sample had the highest
concentration

69
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:02,290
because it reached the threshold signal in
the fewest number of cycles,

70
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:13,520
and the turquoise sample over here at the
lowest concentration.

71
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,440
Because it required the greatest number of
cycles

72
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:26,561
to reach the threshold.

73
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:34,670
So, in summary,

74
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,730
there were two strategies for

75
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:47,600
quantitative PCR, one.

76
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,020
Was the SYBR green strategy, and

77
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:06,140
that's cheap because all you need is a
fluorescent dye with the right properties.

78
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,110
The second was the reporter
oligonucleotide.

79
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,640
Strategy and that's much more expensive
because you

80
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:21,180
have to synthesize chemically synthesize
an oligonucleotide tailor made for

81
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,750
the target sequence you're interested in
and therefore it costs more.

82
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,760
However the reporter oligonucleotide.

83
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,280
It's more specific, because,

84
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,610
a signal is produced only

85
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:49,700
to report our olignuc, oligonucleotide
hyperdizes to the target DNA sequence.

86
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,110
So you need, you have the specificity of
the.

87
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,570
Two [UNKNOWN] type primers plus the
reporter of the oligonucleotide.

88
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,670
So, there you have it, quantitative PCR.

89
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,829
