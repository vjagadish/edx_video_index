00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,720
Hello students.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,880
This is a quick tutorial on how to read a
paper.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,060
Why learn how to read a paper?

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,260
Aren't review articles good enough?

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,017
Well you're an outstanding physician, and
want to see the real data.

6
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:17,000
A patient may ask you about a breakthrough
reported in the news.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,190
You may want to screen many articles.

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,050
So you need to know how to get the key
points of each article in a few minutes.

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,820
You may want to focus on one article, so

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,370
you need to know how to read an article
with a critical eye.

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,730
Imagine you're a pulmonologist.

12
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,776
You see a patient with pulmonary fibrosis.

13
00:00:34,776 --> 00:00:37,510
The disease runs in his family.

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,910
You find a paper by searching the
internet.

15
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,510
What should you do?

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,290
What you shouldn't do, is reading from the
beginning to the end.

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,410
You don't have the time, you don't have
the attention span,

18
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,240
you want the answers right away.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,760
You're going to fall asleep, you just ate
lunch.

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,090
So, here's how to approach the paper.

21
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,520
First, you look at the title [SOUND].

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,720
If it's interesting, you look at the
abstract.

23
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,539
There may be words or concepts you don't
understand.

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,710
That will happen almost all the time.

25
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,710
So you'll go to Google for information.

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,892
And then, at that point.

27
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:25,836
You have enough information, so you can
look at the key data.

28
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:29,893
Now, if you want to dig deeper, you can
look at other stuff.

29
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:34,220
You can look at other figures, you can
look in the introduction, for

30
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,140
some more background, definition of terms.

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,760
You can look up key references.

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:50,000
You can scan the methods, to see if they
generally will give you reliable data.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,360
You should look at the conflicts of
interests.

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,348
The prospect of getting rich can cloud an
author's judgment.

35
00:01:56,348 --> 00:02:01,950
Then if you're really interested, you can
read the entire paper.

36
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:08,028
So, here's the paper we found by searching
the internet.

37
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:14,200
It links telomerase mutations, to a
disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

38
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,880
Well that looks very interesting,
completely unexpected.

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,210
And then you look at the authors.

40
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,920
And one of the authors here, you recognize
her name,

41
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,540
because she shared the Nobel prize in
discovering telomerase.

42
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,000
This is probably a solid group of
researchers.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,320
You don't know much about idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis, so

44
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,610
you do a Google search.

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,690
You type this into the search box, and
this is what you get.

46
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,310
And over here, on the right hand side,

47
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,610
is a definition for idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis.

48
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,540
Idiopathic means without known cause.

49
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,750
Pulmonary fibrosis means scarring and
thickening of the lungs.

50
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:05,670
And look here, down here, pretty high on
the search, is an entry from Wikipedia.

51
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,670
I often go to Wikipedia sites, if I need
to get more information.

52
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,920
Now, we jump to the abstract.

53
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,049
You don't even read the abstract, from
beginning to end.

54
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:23,090
No, you look for the punchline, and the
punchline is down here in the conclusions.

55
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,800
And you see that mutations in the genes
encoding telomerase components,

56
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,850
can appear as familial idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis.

57
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,560
That's the punchline.

58
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,240
Well, the connection between those two
things is completely unexpected, and so

59
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,450
you want to know, what's the background
behind that?

60
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,699
Well, it turns out that mutations in genes
including telomerase,

61
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,380
cause a different disease called
dyskeratosis congenita.

62
00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:01,892
Well, it's a rare disease, but contained
in that disease, are other manifestations.

63
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:06,710
Aplastic anemia and in particular,
pulmonary fibrosis.

64
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,290
So you can immediately surmise that what
the authors did, was they decided to look

65
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:21,100
for germ line mutations, and the same
genes in patients who come from families

66
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:27,020
with pulmonary fibrosis without the other
manifestations of dyskerytosis congenita.

67
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,430
And you can immediately see how they did
this.

68
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:38,352
They screened 73 probands from a registry
of familial pulmonary fibrosis.

69
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:45,453
And of those 73 probands, six had
mutations in the telom,

70
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:49,640
telomerase genes, HTERT and HTR.

71
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:57,220
Okay, so now you know what the key
features of the paper are.

72
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,980
And you have enough information to jump to
the key data.

73
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,710
And here are the key data.

74
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:07,090
And you can tell, because it's labelled,
mutations in telomerase.

75
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,384
And you can see the six probands listed.

76
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:15,470
They came from six different families, A,
B, C, D, E, and F.

77
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:22,940
Okay, and each of them has a mutation in
one of the genes that encodes telomerase.

78
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,580
Five of them in the HTERT gene, and one of
them in the HTR gene.

79
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,670
And then the next question you have is,

80
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,425
do these mutations really cause shortened
telomeres.

81
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:42,172
And so you, you realize that this figure
here,

82
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:46,113
is going to be key because it shows
telomere length.

83
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:49,262
Here's telomere length.

84
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:52,229
In mutation carriers versus their
relatives.

85
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,620
So here are the carriers, in orange.

86
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,200
And here are their relatives, in blue.

87
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,430
And generally speaking, you can see.

88
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,889
[BLANK_AUDIO]

89
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:13,911
That the orange dots, and squares.

90
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:21,379
Are, generally showing shorter telomeres,
than the blue dots and squares.

91
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,163
So, you have a pretty good idea of what
the data look like.

92
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:31,878
Now, you have a pretty, in the, in the
period of time that we've taken

93
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:38,091
you through this, you can see that we have
the general gist of the paper.

94
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:40,720
So in summary, what have I asked you to
do?

95
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,273
I've asked you to read, by jumping.

96
00:06:45,273 --> 00:06:51,721
And then when, very early on,

97
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:57,438
you jump, to the key data.

98
00:06:57,438 --> 00:07:00,705
[SOUND]

99
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:06,615
You understand very quickly what's new.

100
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:11,660
[SOUND]

101
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,320
And if you've taken the trouble to read
the paper with a critical eye,

102
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:26,410
you can decide for yourself, if you
believe the conclusions.

103
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,700
Don't worry, you'll get better at this.

104
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,110
Your medical knowledge will grow so

105
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,800
that you can put things into context more
quickly.

106
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,180
You'll overcome your math phobia.

107
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,970
You better overcome it, and understand
some statistics.

108
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,620
You will acquire good judgment, and

109
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,330
will be able to apply what you find in the
medical literature to help your patient.

110
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,100
Thank you.
