1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,760
Now let's talk about contingency tables.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,740
For this example, we'll be building our
own data set related to marital status.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,170
It will be three variables.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,852
One for gender, where females get a one
and males get a zero.

5
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:15,920
There will be another variable for race,
with one for white and zero for black.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,520
The third variable is for marital status.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,625
Those who are single get a zero, people
who are married get a one,

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,190
and those who are divorced get a two.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,510
Now we have our new data set.

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,922
Let's start with a simple contingency
table.

11
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:31,490
There will be one row variable and one
column variable.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,430
Let's take a look at some code.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,770
Notice how I've included
gender*MaritalStat.

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,550
This is the way of specifying which two
variables you want to analyze.

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,390
By putting gender first, we are
establishing this as the row variable.

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,120
Marital stat will then automatically
become the column variable.

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,860
Let's run the code and take a look at the
output.

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,080
Here you see we've created our two by two
table for gender and marital status.

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,960
[BLANK_AUDIO]

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,550
As you can see from the table, you have
Frequency, Percent, Row Percent, and

21
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,930
Column Percent.

22
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,600
Let's take a look at the first cell in our
table.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,380
These are the people in the gender equal
to zero and marital stat equal to zero.

24
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,410
In other words, this cell depicts makes
who are single.

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,460
The first number 13, is the number of
single men in our data set.

26
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,920
The second number, 34.21 is the percent of
single males in our total group.

27
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,845
The row percent is the third number.

28
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:37,284
So 72.22% means that out of the males,
around 72% were single.

29
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:41,269
Finally, 56.52 is the column percent.

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,740
This means that nearly 57% of all single
people in our data set were males.

31
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,720
[BLANK_AUDIO]

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,520
>> Staring at all of these numbers can be
pretty confusing.

33
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,390
It's easy to make a mistake and choose the
wrong number when you do your analysis.

34
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,150
Luckily, SAS lets you suppress certain
output values.

35
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,790
Here's the code for how you can do that.

36
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:09,950
By including nocol, nopercent, and norow,
we'll be left with just our frequencies.

37
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,560
Let's run this code.

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,600
As you can see, we have a much cleaner
table now with just the frequencies.

39
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,280
So now we know there are 13 single men,
five married men, and zero divorced men.

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,430
This couple use the dataset that we looked
at earlier,

41
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,980
with people who are treated and people who
are cured.

42
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,570
This code will set up a two by two
contingency table, and

43
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,085
only give us the frequencies that we want.

44
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:36,440
[SOUND]

45
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,910
This quadrant shows the number of subjects
who were treated and cured.

46
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,350
This one shows that unknown subjects were
treated and not cured.

47
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,520
This is the number of subjects who were
not treated, but were cured.

48
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,056
And these are the subjects who were not
treated and not cured.

49
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:54,860
In your HRP 225 course, you learn how to
calculate risk ratios and Oz ratios.

50
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,810
Now that we have a two by two table setup,
you can calculate a risk ratio to

51
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,590
estimate the association between getting
treatment and being cured.

52
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,751
In the next module we'll show you how you
can use Proc Freq to

53
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,820
have SAS solve this for you.
