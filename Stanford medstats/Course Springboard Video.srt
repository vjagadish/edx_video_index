1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,070
As you probably already know, microbiology
is the study of microscopic organisms.

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,330
And these can be tiny single celled
organisms like bacteria or

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,098
colonies of cells like fungi.

4
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:17,900
Or even non-cellular entities like
viruses.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,210
That need to live inside host cells, in
order to replicate.

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,640
Microbes live in every ecosystem on earth.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,190
And the earliest ones have been around for
more three billion years.

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,320
The human microbe biome,

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,840
is the collection of around two hundred
trillion bacteria that live on the skin.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,170
Inside the mouth, and eyes, and in the
gastrointestinal tract,

11
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:48,170
of the average adult human, there are ten
times as many microbes, as there are cells

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:53,090
in the adult human body, and many of these
microbes are commensals, they live in

13
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,960
peace with us, or even help us to do
things, like break down nutrients.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,610
In the digestive tract, or produce
vitamins that keep us healthy, but

15
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,500
obviously, sometimes microbes can cause
disease, and

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,300
this happens in a variety of ways.

17
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,770
In order to cause disease, microbes need
to enter and

18
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,960
colonize a part of the body, they are not
supposed to inhabit, then they

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,034
have to find ways of persisting there or
replicating beyond their usual numbers.

20
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,620
In order for the species to survive, they
need to exit the host.

21
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,360
And through all of these activities,
microbes will evolve,

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,760
sometimes developing virulence factors
that help them survive and

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,969
potentially make them more pathogenic than
they were before.

24
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,370
The science and practice of immunology,
tries to

25
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:50,090
understand the host immune defenses, that
either keep commensal microbes in check,

26
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,470
or actively defend the body against
pathogenic ones.

27
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,870
Physical barriers like skin and mucus
membranes, help keep pathogens out and

28
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,760
a variety of specialized cells,

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,260
help to protect the host from disease
causing organisms,

30
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,470
the first line cells in the immune system
form part of the inate immune system.

31
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,500
They detect and

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,300
recognize potential pathogens, even if
they never encountered them before.

33
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,550
And they can then deploy a cascade of
other body defense,

34
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,990
including activating the adapted immune
systems with

35
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,450
the end goal of either eliminating the
pathogen or in the case of commensals.

36
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,280
Finding a way to tolerate the existing of
certain microbes in ways that

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,620
don't result in disease.

38
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,880
Through these encounters with microbes,
the adaptive immune system,

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,380
will remember certain pathogens and

40
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,400
store an arsenal of [UNKNOWN] in case that
pathogen every gets encountered again.

41
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,730
Most of the time.

42
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,190
The microbes in and

43
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,290
on the host, are successfully kept in
check, by the host's immune system.

44
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,240
But when the steady state is disturbed or

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,590
if the immune system, begins to behave
inappropriately towards host cells.

46
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,520
The result is a clinical presentation of
disease.

47
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,290
If the immune system becomes too weak, or

48
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,160
too strong, or if the microbes become to
aggressive or

49
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,660
go places they're not supposed to be in
the body, the equilibrium is disturbed and

50
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,120
physicians need to figure out what went
wrong.

51
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,630
By understanding the characteristics of
different microbes and

52
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,140
how the host immune system usually reacts
to them.

53
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,460
Physicians can recognize, collections of
signs and

54
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,470
symptoms and integrate that with other
details from the history and

55
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,860
physical exam, to lead to a list of likely
diagnosis.

56
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,480
Which can then be confirmed in many cases,

57
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,950
with the help of things like lab tests and
imaging.

58
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,890
Understanding the relevant microbiology
and immunology as it

59
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,960
applies to each patient, helps the
physician initiate the right therapy.

60
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,600
For example, choose the right antibiotic
for a specific type of bacteria.

61
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,080
Or recognize when the immune system, may
itself be causing damage to the body,

62
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,340
and the physician can then try to mediate.

63
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,680
Knowing when these diseases are most
likely to occur,

64
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,870
how different microbes are spread, and how
they cause disease.

65
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,830
This knowledge can help with prevention
efforts,

66
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,460
both at the level of the individual
patient and on the population level,

67
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,809
when we start thinking about the
epidemiology of a disease.

68
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,340
Using a framework of this kind can help
physicians approach a variety of

69
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,670
different diseases in an organized and

70
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:47,160
systematic way by trying to understand the
clinical presentation of a patient

71
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,980
as a result of the interplay between
microbes and the host immune system.

72
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,610
We'll be much more likely, to succeed in
managing the disease.
