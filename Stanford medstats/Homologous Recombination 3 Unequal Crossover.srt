1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,937
Okay.
This is,

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:08,420
chapter three of our series on Homogolous
Recombination.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,545
Here, we're going to describe something,
called unequal crossover,

4
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:22,696
so in unequal crossover, you can actually
get something called Gene Duplication.

5
00:00:22,696 --> 00:00:25,720
And what I am going to do is, diagram for
you how this can happen.

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,620
The only way you can have unequal
crossover of courses, if

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,740
you have crossover and in the last section
we described how crossover can occur.

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,050
If you resolve the two holiday junctions
with one longitudinal cut and

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,900
one transverse cut.

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:47,240
And so I've drawn for you, or I've kept
for you here the diagram

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,300
of the cuts in the holiday junctions that
will lead to crossover.

12
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,900
And as a result of this you will have

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,380
a blue chromosome turning into a red
chromosome from here this blue chromosome.

14
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,300
Okay.
On the other side of the resolution of

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,240
the resolution of [INAUDIBLE] will
continue on as a red chromosome and

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,148
this red chromosome over here will
continue on as a blue chromosome.

17
00:01:14,148 --> 00:01:21,700
Because the transverse cuts lead to
crossover.

18
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,510
So now imagine that you have a genome
where there are homologous sequences

19
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,260
scattered throughout.

20
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,070
Let me give an example.

21
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,800
This, and this did happen to the beta
globin gene.

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,029
Suppose you have beta globin genes and,
one beta globin gene and

23
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:41,860
it's surrounded by repeated sequences.

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,270
So I'm going to draw for you a beta globin
gene.

25
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,100
Here is a beta globin gene.

26
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,590
All right.

27
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,860
And it's surrounded by repeated sequences.

28
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,370
All right.

29
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,220
So this beta globin gene is surrounded by
repeated sequences.

30
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,400
And I'll draw for you a repeated sequence.

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,100
And in fact let's call this repeated
sequence, let's just in fact it's true.

32
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,990
That there are sequences called line
elements that actually,

33
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,660
could flank the beta globin gene.

34
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,811
So let me call this line element L1.

35
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,078
Okay?

36
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:28,870
L1.
And again, this is the beta globin gene.

37
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:34,440
And I'm going to describe to you how
unequal crossover can generate

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,110
duplication of the beta globin gene.

39
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,840
Imagine that the DNA undergoes homogolous
recombination but

40
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,780
it undergoes homogolous recombination by
lining up the homoged chromosomes.

41
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:57,410
But occasionally, it can produce a
misalignment because of these,

42
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,330
presence of these repeated sequences.

43
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,919
And as a result of that misalignment, this
is what could happen.

44
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:13,260
So, let me draw the beta globin gene over
here.

45
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,229
All right?

46
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:20,834
And there's another line element.

47
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:26,625
I'm running out of space, but bear with me
and

48
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:33,307
over here, the other side of the beta
globin gene

49
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:39,520
with the other line element that flanks
it, so.

50
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,359
So suppose during that homologous
recombination occurs.

51
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,670
By searching for the homology between the
line element on the upper chromosome and

52
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,440
the line element on the lower chromosomes.

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,790
As a result of that the homologous
recombination if it occurs between these

54
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,110
two line elements will lead to a
misalignment of the DNA.

55
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,990
And that will result in what's called a
cross-over.

56
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,040
I'll use that as the notation and

57
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,780
the way that would happen of course is by
homologous recombination up here

58
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,532
because we're going to imagine that the
line element L1 is here in

59
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:23,713
this region, L1, line.

60
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,650
Okay.
So the homologous recombination would be

61
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,620
occurring between two line elements.

62
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:38,868
So I've drawn say a blow up of the line
element here in the upper panel.

63
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:45,740
And and then you'll have resolution of the
holiday junctions.

64
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,430
In a way that leads to crossovers.

65
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,520
So this, this X here, indicates the
crossover.

66
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,837
As a result of that crossover,

67
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:54,380
you now have a resolution into two
different chromosomes.

68
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,575
One chromosome will have, two beta globin
genes.

69
00:04:57,575 --> 00:05:05,670
So the upper chromosome here,

70
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:13,020
let's draw that in, we'll have one beta
globin gene.

71
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,530
Okay.
So you have one beta globin gene,

72
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,130
along with its line element, L1.

73
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,660
Okay.

74
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,460
And then you come over here, to this
downstream line element,

75
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,310
you have a modest combination with a
crossover.

76
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:40,260
And so, you would end up with a line
element.

77
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:40,770
Right?

78
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,680
.
Let's line them up.

79
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,160
Let's line up the line elements.

80
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,963
Oh boy.

81
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:47,560
Bad pun.

82
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,570
Okay.
Here we go with a second beta globin

83
00:05:52,940 --> 00:06:01,130
gene and it's downstream line element.

84
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,421
Okay.
And, the lower chromosome will start

85
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:05,400
over here.

86
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,010
Do the un, the crossover, and come up
here.

87
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,140
And as a result of that.

88
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,133
[BLANK_AUDIO]

89
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:21,314
You'll have this kind of a chromosome with
only a single line element,

90
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,590
and no beta globin genes.

91
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,940
So as a result of this unequal crossover,
one chromosome now

92
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,740
has two beta globin genes, and the other
chromosome has no beta globin genes.

93
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,380
And again, these are the products of what
we call unequal crossover.

94
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,570
So this is unequal.

95
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,761
[BLANK_AUDIO]

96
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:48,468
Crossover.

97
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:51,520
[BLANK_AUDIO]

98
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,940
And you can see, that this type of unequal
crossover can now lead to

99
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,260
a chromosome with no beta globin genes.

100
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,970
Or think of another situation, where you
have a primordial globin gene.

101
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,810
You may already know that there are many
different globin genes.

102
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,870
There's an alpha globin, there's a beta
globin and so on.

103
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,890
And what may have happened long ago was,
that there was a single globin gene,

104
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:22,830
flanked by repetitive sequences like this
line element to L1.

105
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:30,340
That primordial globin gene could've been
duplicated into two different primordial

106
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,530
globin genes which then could evolve
separately one to eventually becoming

107
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,600
the beta globin gene and the other
eventually becoming the alpha globin gene.

108
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,680
So that's how unequal crossover works.

109
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,180
Thank you.
