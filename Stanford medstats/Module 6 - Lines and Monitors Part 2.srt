[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:16,020
Great, well Carly we have a kit right
here, in front of us.

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,650
Why don't you go through it for me and
show me some of the features.

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,990
Sure, so this is how I like to set up my
arterial line kits.

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,070
I use the board to place under the
patient's arm to keep it in

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,370
the correct position.

7
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,030
Then, I clean it with a sterile cleaning
solution, and

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,330
cover it with a sterile drape.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,740
This is our arterial catheter that we use.

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,800
Your's may differ at your institution.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,580
At ours it's similar to our IV catheters
in which it

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,140
has the small plastic catheter over the
needle.

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,020
Once you insert that into the artery, you
can then put a line,

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,710
the wire through the plastic portion,
collecting any blood that may

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,440
spill out in the gauze, and once the line
is in, then you connect

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,510
the soft plastic portion to the sterile
saline flush that you have preset up.

17
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:08,310
If you're doing the arterial line under
awake conditions you can use

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,610
the lidocaine drawn up with a straw and
use a small bore needle to inject it so

19
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,750
the patient is comfortable while you're
doing the procedure.

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,320
We then have a sterile adhesive locking
device and

21
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,510
a sterile occlusive dressing that you
place over the arterial line once it is in

22
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,980
place and, and the ceiling has been
flushed.

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,270
>> Okay Carly, well it looks like we have
another kit in front of us,

24
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,660
this one looks like its for a central
line,.

25
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,450
Why don't you take us through it?

26
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,430
>> Sure.
So, I like to be very organized when I

27
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,760
put together my central line kit.

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,800
I have my disinfecting swab, then my
sterile dressing, and I

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,330
always have my ultra sound probe cover in
addition to the sterile ultra-sound gel.

30
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,700
You'll have an assistant to put those
together when you're,

31
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,190
when you're doing your central line, it's
very important.

32
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,170
Then, I set everything up in my kit.

33
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,620
I have the catheter here, which is your
triple-lumen catheter.

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,770
Now, it will come with these attached.

35
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,750
What I do is I take them off and I put
these blue Claves on,

36
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,600
as you see on the blue and the white port.

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,230
The brown part I leave open so that the
wire can go through,

38
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,020
and I always have a third clave ready for
when I have the line inside.

39
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,020
>> Now, tell me Carly why you do that.

40
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,900
>> It helps with our sterile technique.

41
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,390
The claves are they prevent any blood from
coming back, but

42
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,590
they also allow you to use alcohol or some
other sort of disinfectant so

43
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,280
that the line stays clean and the patient
doesn't get an infection.

44
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,430
The other things you'll find in you kit
are,

45
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,300
a syringe with a needle attached to it.

46
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,490
Some people prefer use this syringe,
there's others in the kit.

47
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,120
Whatever you preference and your
institution's preference is.

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,940
The blue syringe will have a whole in the
back here so

49
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,910
that you have the option of placing the
wire through.

50
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,280
This is the wire.

51
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,440
We put the wire in through the syringe or

52
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,110
through the needle, after you've placed
the central line.

53
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,130
It is mobile here.

54
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,380
As you saw in the video, the steps can be
quite complex.

55
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,600
So, we'll reference you back to the New
England Journal video, for

56
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,400
the exact steps.

57
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,700
Other things that are contained in the
kit, are the dilator here.

58
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,890
Which goes over the wire and can help open
up the skin for placement of the line.

59
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,630
This is also true of the scalpel which is
quite sharp and

60
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:28,390
should always be covered and used safely
so that no one gets injured.

61
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,440
The other things that come in the kit are,
a transducer probe,

62
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,990
which we don't use very often at our, our
institution.

63
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,640
You can check with your attendings and

64
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,270
other teachers at your institution to use
that.

65
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:42,340
You'll also have an 18 gauge needle, as
well as some staples for

66
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,250
fixing any of your ultrasound covers or
anything you might need to.

67
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,240
There's also lidocaine and

68
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,450
a syringe if you every need to put in a
central line wall the patient is awake.

69
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,370
Things which also come in the kit are the
needle with a needle driver to

70
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,960
secure the line after it is in place and

71
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,190
then we also have our sterile reclusive
dressing and a patch which helps

72
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,380
again with sterility to make sure that
the, the area that the line is placed.

73
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,260
Does not have any bacteria that can go
into the patient.

74
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,730
>> Okay, Carlee word, we have another kit
in front of us.

75
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,550
It looks similar to the last one but a
little different.

76
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,960
Can you explain it to us?

77
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,520
>> Sure.

78
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,410
It is similar, but there's a few things
we'd like to point out.

79
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,530
So, first of all, you'll recognize the
sterile dressing.

80
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,160
Again, this is line that should always be
placed under a sterile technique.

81
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,880
You'll also have this syringe and the
needle that you will use

82
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,240
to place the the central line, and other
things you'll recognize are the lidocaine

83
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,000
if you do it under sterile conditions
however there's some very different items.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,450
This is a large introducer catheter.

85
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,790
You'll notice it doesn't have the triple
lumens like we have in the other one.

86
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,320
It has one large one.

87
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,190
And it's nine French.

88
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,850
So it's used more often for transfusing
large volumes.

89
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,290
It also is handy, because you can place
what's called a pulmonary artery catheter.

90
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,470
We have one curled up here.

91
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,650
It's quite long, and this goes into the
patient.

92
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,780
Much like you saw in both the New England
Journal video.

93
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,630
As well, in our lecture, we talked about
some of the indications and reasons.

94
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,270
Things that are different are, will have a
balloon on the end.

95
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,310
Which actually is able to be pumped up
with a syringe that

96
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,040
attaches specially here, and has a little
locking device.

97
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,110
So if you do blow the balloon up, and you
can lock it in place so that it stays.

98
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,850
>> Now Carly, let me ask you a question.

99
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,940
>> Sure.
>> If you don't happen to have a 3 CC

100
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,160
syringe, can you stick a 20 CC syringe on
that?

101
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,970
>> Absolutely not.

102
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,230
It's a good question, but no, it's really
important that you don't do

103
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,310
something like that and you use only the
syringe that comes with the kit or

104
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,130
a small syringe, because you don't want to
over fill the balloon while it's in

105
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,680
the pulmonary artery, because you can
actually rupture the artery.

106
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,810
>> Okay, well we don't want that.

107
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,910
>> We don't want that, absolutely not.

108
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,410
Other things that you'll notice in this
kit are again,

109
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:05,170
your scalpel which you use to help cut the
skin, and then you can insert the dilator.

110
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,440
Again, you'll notice that this is a larger
and longer dilator.

111
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,830
Which is necessary because as we mentioned
before,

112
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,190
this is a much larger catheter that you'll
place.

113
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,060
Other things that are different and this
is something that

114
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,570
I always forget you have to remember, make
a note to remember to place this little

115
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,460
protective sheath onto your pulmonary
artery catheter before you place it

116
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,080
in the patient otherwise you have to take
it out and start all over again.

117
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,570
Again you'll notice that there's three
different ports here.

118
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,140
Aside from the one that you used to blow
up the balloon, so

119
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,870
you can inject medications and infusions
like we do normally.

120
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,730
And that's basically it.

121
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,680
That's the big differences between this
one, and, and the center line.

122
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,290
>> Can I see the wire there too.

123
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,180
>> You do have the wire here, and again,

124
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,630
at our institution we actually on our
checklist have a note.

125
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:54,120
That we make to remove all of the wires
and all of the dialaters so that we

126
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,620
all verbally confirm with ourselves and
the nurses and the surgeons that all of

127
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,970
those have been removed from the patient
so we don't have any of them left inside.

128
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:03,600
>> Wonderful.

129
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,020
Well I thought it was really helpful to
look at those kits.

130
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,970
Cause it's always great to get a sense of
the equipment that you're going to be

131
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,040
working with, and I encourage you,

132
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,560
out there watching, to take a look at your
own institution's kits.

133
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,330
They may be the same, they may be slightly
different, but

134
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,270
it's great to have a look at the equipment
that you'll be using so you're familiar

135
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,370
with what you're going to be working with
when you start doing these procedures.

136
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,800
Now to recap what we learned in the
segment,

137
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,350
the first thing is that we really try we
really understood the indications for

138
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,690
when we want to use monitors and lines.

139
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,740
For instance, an arterial catheterization
is useful when you want beat to

140
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,940
beat monitoring of hemodynamic, and you
may consider in,

141
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,920
central venous lines when you want to,
infuse medications,

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,490
or also consider lines when you want to,
get frequent blood draws.

143
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,460
We also talked about the importance of
having help when you place a line.

144
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,440
Someone to monitor the well-being of vital
signs, the hemodynamics of the patient

145
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,390
while your attention is focused on the
procedure and the task of placing lines.

146
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,540
Of course, also consider using checklists,
and

147
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,060
also keep in mind the importance of
sterilities,

148
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,770
because avoiding line infections is really
our responsibility as practictions,

149
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,910
physicians who are placing these lines to
avoid iotragenic complications and

150
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,680
injuries to our patients.

151
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,590
Your institutions may have checklists to
help insure that

152
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,520
these safety measures are followed, and I
encourage you to look.

153
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,780
Into your own institution's policies and

154
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,540
checklists to make sure that as youre
learning these techniques, that you're

155
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,380
doing them in the right way and following
the expectations of your institution.

156
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,700
So we hope you learned a lot on this
episode and we'll see you soon.

157
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,104
Thanks so much.

158
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:09,104
