00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:38,811
>> Hi, I'm Doctor Larry Chu.

4
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:40,194
>> And I'm Doctor Kevin Jenner.

5
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:43,480
>> And we're here today to talk to you
about a new

6
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,970
online course that we're going to be
launching on geriatric anesthesia.

7
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,500
And issues associated with it the
perioperative care of elderly patients.

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,040
Kevin, let's start off by just asking this
question, let's get it out of the way.

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,410
Are you going to be an expert in geriatric
anaesthesia after completing this course?

10
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,180
>> Absolutely not, this course is designed
as an introductory overview of

11
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,500
geriatric perioperative issues.

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,110
In order to become proficient in geria,
geriatric perioperative care, you will

13
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,660
need to seek additional resources and may
need to do additional study in the topic.

14
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,640
>> So we really want to give you an
overview, an introduction and

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,280
we're going to do that through several
ways.

16
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,540
We have several modules laid out for you.

17
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,012
We're going to talk a little bit about
physiology.

18
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:31,630
We're going to talk about pharmacology
associated with elderly patients.

19
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,310
We'll show you some examples in action
where we look at

20
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,820
ethical issues associated with the care of
elderly patients.

21
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,040
And we'll wrap it up with discussing some
post-operative issues.

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,000
So if that sounds good, let's get started.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,583
>> Let's get started
