[BLANK_AUDIO].
In this next module, I'm going to

2
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:13,040
show you how linear regression
accommodates categorical predictors.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,674
And I'll also show you the link between
ttests, and ANOVA, and linear regression.

4
00:00:18,674 --> 00:00:22,280
So, how does linear regression handle
categorical predictors?

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,060
In the case of a binary predictor is
actually really easy.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,800
In the very first beginning of this
course, I talked a lot

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,250
about binary variables and thinking about
them as 0,1, as numerical variables.

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,500
Well, that becomes useful now because the
way that we

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,570
handle binary variables is just to put
them in a linear regression model and

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,550
treat them as numbers, as a 0 and a 1.

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,820
And that makes it easy to model, and I'll
show you the picture in a minute.

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,370
Categorical variables are just slightly
more tricky.

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,740
These are variables that have more than
two categories.

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:58,538
We are essentially going to turn them into
a series of binary, of 0,1 variables.

15
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:01,505
And that's the way we're going to
accommodate them in the regression model.

16
00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:02,920
We call this dummy coding.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,020
And I'm going to get to this dummy coding
idea in a few minutes.

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,790
But let's start with the easier case, with
the binary case.

19
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,130
Imagine for the,

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,390
for a moment that I wanted to use vitamin
D as a binary predictor.

21
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,580
We have been talking about this example
all week where I've been

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,680
treating vitamin D as a continuous
predictor.

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,210
But there might be some reason that I end
up wanting to treat vitamin D

24
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,180
as a binary predictor.

25
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,900
Maybe I didn't measure, maybe.

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,990
And for some reason, in my data, said I
don't have it as a continuous predictor.

27
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,940
Or maybe, for some reason, I'm clinically
interested in

28
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,980
comparing the insufficient group to the
sufficient group.

29
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,220
So for whatever reason, I'm using vitamin
D as a binary predictor.

30
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,364
If I look in my data set, and let's say
I'm, this is sort of arbitrary, let's

31
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:50,530
say less than 15 nmol/L is a clinical
reason for calling that insufficient.

32
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,792
More than that we'll call that sufficient.

33
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:56,010
We're going to code this insufficient
variable as a 1,0.

34
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,740
So, if you're a 1, that means you're in an
insufficient group.

35
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,360
If you're a 0, that means you're in a
sufficient group.

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,190
I actually looked my data set and the mean
DSST score,

37
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,685
the mean cognitive score in the
insufficient indeed was lower.

38
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:14,390
That in the sufficient group it was 32.5,
and in the sufficient group it was 40.

39
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,400
Now you might just think about the
lectures that we had last week.

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,300
And you might say oh well, here I've got a
situation where I

41
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,362
have a continuous normally distributed
outcome variable.

42
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:25,024
I've got two groups I want to compare.

43
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:27,770
I want to compare the means of that
continuous variable.

44
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,320
Between two groups, why wouldn't I just
use a t-test here?

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,377
And indeed, you could absolutely use a
ttest here.

46
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:37,530
I'm going to show you how to also use
linear regression, and

47
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,690
to analyze these same data.

48
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,260
And then, I'll show you how the linear
regression and

49
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,610
the ttests actually give you identical
answers.

50
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,770
Let me graph this for you.

51
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,352
So again, we're treating our, our binary
variable as a 0,1 variable.

52
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:53,590
One means you're in the insufficient
group,

53
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,680
zero means you're sufficient, you're in
the normal level group.

54
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,500
The linear regression line here is the
easiest possible line you can draw.

55
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,695
So, what I'm showing you here, these
little individual points represent all of

56
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:09,020
DSST levels, for all of the people in the
normal group.

57
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,230
Their mean level is right here at 40.

58
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,930
That was the mean in in the normal group,
the vitamin D

59
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,320
insufficient group over here.

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,910
This is all their DSST levels.

61
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,640
Their mean, as I mentioned, with 32 32.5.

62
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,770
So, what's this line?

63
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,130
All I did to draw this line was to connect
the two means.

64
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,500
It's really, it's like the simplest line,
line you can possibly draw.

65
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,260
Any two points, you can connect them, and
draw a line.

66
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,113
And it's, we don't have to test the
linearity assumption here.

67
00:03:38,113 --> 00:03:41,570
Because when you have two points, it's
automatically going to make a line.

68
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,740
So, that's nice.

69
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,610
The intercept of this line as you can see
here is 40.

70
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,110
What's the slope of this line going to be?

71
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,880
Well, the x variable only goes from 0 to
1.

72
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,280
So, there's only going to be a one unit
change in x.

73
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,900
What happens to y when x goes from 0 to 1?

74
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Well, y goes from 40 down to 32.5.

75
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,514
So, the slope of this line is It's
going to be 40 - 32.5 or 7.5.

76
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:09,240
Notice that that's just the difference in
means, between the two groups.

77
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,550
I then took these data and

78
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,450
actually ran them officially in a linear
regression program.

79
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,130
And indeed, not surprisingly, what I get
out in the model is,

80
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,770
here is the parameter estimates.

81
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,470
So the, the intercept is 40, and the
difference in means, the,

82
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,637
the beta here is negative.

83
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:25,580
Get a 7.5 because we're decreasing as
we're

84
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,630
going from sufficient to insufficient.

85
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,730
It's highly statistically significant as
you can see.

86
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,440
This has just given me back the equation
of that line.

87
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,490
We could also kind of look at the graph
again to,

88
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,610
to see the equation of that line.

89
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,020
And the intercept represents the mean
value in the sufficient group.

90
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,180
The slope here just represents the
difference in means between

91
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,354
the two groups and it is statistically
significant.

92
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:52,590
Now, I want to show you what would have
happened had we run these data in

93
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,680
a ttest rather than bothering to get fancy
and run a linear regression.

94
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,200
Well, we would have got the same answer
again, and

95
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,020
we have two groups, we want to compare
means.

96
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,460
We can evaluate these data with a ttest.

97
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,300
It turns out that the slope we get from
linear regression is

98
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,600
exactly equal to the difference in means.

99
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,670
Which is the effect of size of interest
for

100
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:15,070
a ttest and the p-values we get out are
also exactly identical.

101
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,060
So, here's the ttest that we would run.

102
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,480
We would in the numerator going the
difference in mean.

103
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,133
Again which is 40 minus 32.5 or 7.5.

104
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:25,840
We can calcuate the standard error in the
demoninator that turns out to be the same

105
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,260
standard error that you can in the linear
regression model in the earlier slide.

106
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,620
The T-value comes out to be 3.46, the
p-value comes out to be 0.008.

107
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,070
And actually, if you look at the previous
slide,

108
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,270
you can see that that is the T-value and
the p-value from the linear regression.

109
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,780
So, there's nothing new here
mathematically.

110
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,380
A ttest and linear regression are exactly
the same.

111
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,800
You could say we don't even really need to
have a ttest in the world because you

112
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,595
could always run that problem, that
particular problem, in linear regression.

113
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:57,292
It's just, of course, that linear
regression is more,

114
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:57,859
you know, seems more complicated.

115
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,161
A ttest seems very simple, so a lot of
times if it, we have the simplest problem,

116
00:05:59,161 --> 00:06:00,505
we end up just defaulting to ttest rather
than calling it a linear regression.

117
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:04,010
But in fact, a ttest is a special case of
linear regression.

118
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,620
Now, I'm going to move to the more tricky
concept,

119
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,511
which is what to do when you have more
than two categories.

120
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:15,088
You have a categorical predictor

121
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:20,068
with more than two categories.

122
00:06:20,068 --> 00:06:25,720
What we're going to have to do here is to
do some dummy coding.

123
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,230
We're going to translate our categories
into a series of binary variables.

124
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,784
So, that we can deal again with binary
variables.

125
00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:38,460
So what what if our vitamin D variable had
been a categorical predictor rather than

126
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,460
a continuous predictor?

127
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,880
What if there were three levels we cared
about the deficient?

128
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,650
That's, like, the really low people.

129
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,070
Insufficient, kind of mildly low and, and
sufficient.

130
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,621
Sometimes people will divide that up this
way.

131
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:53,360
I want to know about the difference in
DSST scores between those three groups.

132
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,717
I could analyze those data then within
ANOVA,

133
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:58,090
a simple ANOVA as we talked about last
week.

134
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,700
And I also could analyze it with linear
regression.

135
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,850
So, let me just tell you what the means,
the mean DSST score in all of these

136
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,930
groups were, so the sufficient group, the
normal group, is still the same here.

137
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,630
The average was still 40.

138
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,280
The insufficient group now excludes the
ones who were lower than 25, so

139
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,680
the average in that group is now 33.13.

140
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,870
And in the deficient group, it turns out
that the mean DSST score is 30.13.

141
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,120
So, it does seem to down across those
groups.

142
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,850
How do we dummy code this?

143
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,489
How do we dummy code these three
categories?

144
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:27,690
So, here's dummy coding.

145
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,577
If I want to take a three-level
categorical variable.

146
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:34,130
I can represent it as a series of binary
variables.

147
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,990
I actually only need two binary variables
if it's a three-level variable.

148
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,519
If it was a four-level categorical
variable,

149
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,949
I would need three binary variables and so
on.

150
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:46,250
There's going to be one group, that's the
reference group, and that's going to

151
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,320
be the variable that has a zero on all
the, on all the binary variables.

152
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,830
Let me illustrate that here.

153
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,160
So, I'm going to make two new variables.

154
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,240
I'm going to create a new variable that is
deficient yes or no.

155
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,730
It's binary here, either in the deficient
category or you're not.

156
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,700
And another one, insufficient.

157
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,100
That's a variable, another binary.

158
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,630
That says you're either in the
insufficient group or you're not.

159
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,130
So, if you're somebody in the deficient
group,

160
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,420
you're going to get a 1 on the deficient
variable, but

161
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,800
a 0 on the insufficient variable.

162
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,090
If you're in the insufficient group,

163
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,780
you're going to get a 0 on the deficient
group because you're not,

164
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,673
you're not deficient.

165
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:20,420
But, you're going to get a one on the
insufficient.

166
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,497
If you're in the sufficient group,

167
00:08:22,497 --> 00:08:25,350
however, you're going to get a zero on
both of those.

168
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,510
So, notice that two binary variables is
sufficient to uniquely identify all

169
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,526
three of those categories.

170
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:34,970
Now, we have a reference group and we have
a series of

171
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,985
binary variables that tell us about the
difference between the deficient group.

172
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,300
And the sufficient group, and

173
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,400
the difference between the insufficient
group and the sufficient group.

174
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,560
How do we represent this in pictures?

175
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:57,430
So, it looks a lot like the pictures we
did for the simple binary predictor,

176
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,281
the insufficient group.

177
00:08:58,281 --> 00:08:59,101
The, again, the mean level of DSST for

178
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:02,490
the insufficient group was about 33, the
mean for the normal group is 40.

179
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,410
It forms a simple line, the intercept is
40, the slope is about negative 7.

180
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,990
For the deficient group,

181
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,210
same intercept because we're still
comparing against the normal group.

182
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,010
The slope here, the, the mean for

183
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:21,280
the deficient group is about 30, so the
slope here is almost 10.

184
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,310
Now technically, this is a multivariate
regression.

185
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,340
because we now have two predictors in the
model.

186
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,780
I could represent these pictures on a
plain.

187
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,180
It's just harder to draw that plane.

188
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,950
So, I represented it as, as two separate
graphs here.

189
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:38,240
I took the, the data, and I put them into
the computer, and

190
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,510
asked it to run a linear regression with
this dummy, these dummy coded variables.

191
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,300
And here are the results that I get.

192
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,276
So here's my model, here's my p-values.

193
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:49,890
Again, the intercept represents the mean
value in the reference group.

194
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,940
That's 40, that's the normal group.

195
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,250
The beta coefficient, the slope for

196
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,287
the insufficient group represents the
difference.

197
00:09:57,287 --> 00:10:02,220
In the DSST levels between the normal
group and the insufficient group,

198
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,000
the difference from the reference.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,960
So, the insufficient group was about
almost 7 units lower in

200
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,070
cognitive score than the normal group.

201
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,940
The deficient group was almost 10 units
lower in the cognitive score than

202
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,935
the normal, so that should show for them.

203
00:10:16,935 --> 00:10:19,949
Both are highly statistically significant.

204
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,720
That's the linear regression equation
written out.

205
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,410
And we can use that to then predict,

206
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,497
what's the mean value for those in the
insufficient group.

207
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:32,670
Those in the deficient group, and those in
the, the normal group.

208
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,890
And you're going to see that for

209
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:39,010
the simple model, it's nothing too
profound, the 40 is the mean.

210
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,770
In that reference group, negative 6.87
represents the difference in

211
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,640
means between the insufficient and
sufficient groups.

212
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,880
And again, negative 9.87 represents the
difference in

213
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,550
means between the deficient and sufficient
groups.

214
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,286
And you can just show this by applying the
equation.

215
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:57,250
So, if I have got a person whose is in the
deficient group, how do I apply this,

216
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,325
the equation to them.

217
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,349
Well, they get they get the intercept.

218
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:04,440
They get a zero because they're not in the
insufficient group, and they get a one for

219
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,230
being deficient.

220
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,390
So, when you do 40 minus 9.87, that's,
that just gives you

221
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:13,280
back what we already knew was the mean in
the in the deficient group.

222
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,450
A person in the insufficient group,

223
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,690
when you apply the equation, they get a
one for insufficient.

224
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,580
A zero for deficient when you add that up
it comes out to be 33.13.

225
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,970
Again, what we already knew was the mean
in the insufficient group.

226
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,710
And the person who's in a su, sufficient
group gets a zero for

227
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,390
both the insufficient and deficient
variables.

228
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,500
So, they're just left with 40, which again
we knew was the mean in the normal group.

229
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,470
So, it's a little like this is an, you
know,

230
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,140
it's just spitting back out the means, it
doesn't seem all that profound.

231
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,550
It doesn't seem, doesn't seem all that
useful but the reason it's going to

232
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,785
be useful is because we might want to
adjust for other variables.

233
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:50,260
ANOVA is just linear regression, so

234
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,440
the p-value that you would get if you ran
ANOVA here is exactly the same as

235
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,460
the p-value you are going to get for the
overall model set for linear regression.

236
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,290
So again, mathematically, these things are
identical.

237
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,260
So, when you you could argue that you
never needed an ANOVA,

238
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,920
you could always just run a linear
regression.

239
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,970
Again, why is this useful?

240
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,820
We're just getting back up the means, it
doesn't seem all that interesting.

241
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,000
But because it's useful, because we can
then throw other things into the mold.

242
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,175
Multi-variant regression model to adjust
for that, those covariance and

243
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:22,110
co-founders, or to get better predictors.

244
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,940
For example, let's say I was to throw age
into the model to try to

245
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,530
get age adjusted means for each of those
vitamin D groups.

246
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,620
Age being the potential confounder here.

247
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,710
So to adjust age, I'm just going to throw
age into the model.

248
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,724
Nothing tricky.

249
00:12:34,724 --> 00:12:38,624
And here is the model that comes out when
I add age to the model.

250
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:43,538
So it's showing these, that again, the
normal group is the reference group so

251
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:45,956
it doesn't get a beta co-effecient.

252
00:12:45,956 --> 00:12:47,594
Now, I get an effect for age.

253
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:50,870
And now I get what are age adjusted beta
coefficients,

254
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,380
these have now been adjusted for age.

255
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,000
Interestingly, these are made of data.

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,240
And so, in the process of making up the
data,

257
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,600
I've built in something a little funny.

258
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,130
Which is that the deficient group after
you adjust for age,

259
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:05,170
actually looks like it has more, a higher
cognitive score than the normal group.

260
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,980
So, once maybe that group was totally full
of much older people, which will count for

261
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,690
the fact that their much older than their,
their deficient.

262
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,590
Their deficiency in vitamin D is actually
associated with a greater a DSST score.

263
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,580
That's a quirk, I think, of the fact that
I made up the data, certainly.

264
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,180
So, that's the final model.

265
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,860
But what's great about this is now I can
report age adjusted means for

266
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,260
those groups.

267
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,839
And this is just showing the picture here.

268
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,530
Again, this is showing the slopes in each
of the three groups.

269
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,480
For the relationship between a age and
DSST score.

270
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,600
So that you can see that in all three
groups,

271
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,840
certainly age is we've built this into the
model.

272
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,410
This is just kind of showing you the
model.

273
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,385
So, age, as age goes up, you go down in
your cognitive function, for sure.

274
00:13:53,385 --> 00:13:56,992
Interestingly, as I mentioned though, once
you account for age the deficient group.

275
00:13:56,992 --> 00:13:59,790
Thus, this blue line, actually send seems
to across all

276
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,569
different ages have a little bit higher of
a, of a cognitive score.

277
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:07,370
Might be quirk of my made up data.

278
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,300
And I can calculate these age adjusted
means the, the easiest way to

279
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,350
calculate the age adjusted mean is just to
imagine that everybody has the same age.

280
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,230
You have to pick an age to plug into the
model.

281
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,990
So, say let's plug in the mean age for the
whole data set which is here 55 years old.

282
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,700
So, I can get the expected average DSST
value.

283
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,050
For a vitamin deficient,

284
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:31,140
D deficient person who's 55 years old by
plugging all that into the model.

285
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,660
So, we can just plug in this model to find
the expected DSST score for

286
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,832
somebody who's vitamin D deficient and is
55 years old.

287
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:40,660
So, we're fixing age so that age is the
same across these three groups,

288
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,233
that person has an expected score of 36.

289
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,641
Somebody whose insufficient whose at 55
years old,

290
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:50,647
based on this model is predicted to have a
DSST score of 29.1.

291
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:54,553
And for the normal group, a 55 year old is
actually predicted to be lower and

292
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:57,210
have a DSST score of 27.7.

293
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,921
Again, probably a quirk of my made up
data.

294
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:01,801
But, it's nice to have these age adjusted
means cause you can then record

295
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,811
the unadjusted means and the age adjusted
means.

296
00:15:04,811 --> 00:15:06,825
So, you can see it totally flipped the
relationship here once we

297
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:08,132
had accounted for age.

298
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:11,930
And that might be something funny in my
made up data.
