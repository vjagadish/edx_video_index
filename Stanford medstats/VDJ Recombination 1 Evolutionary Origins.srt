1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,940
This is a review of VDJ recombinations.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,780
Starting from the beginning and I mean
really starting from the beginning and

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,300
then going through the whole process.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,650
So here we are at the beginning of time,
actually not really.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,400
Around the time when jawless fish were
swimming in the ocean.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,210
And around that time, there was a
transposable element,

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,630
mobile element, that hops around from
genome to genome.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,160
And mobile elements have, are like retro
viruses.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,950
They have sequences at their ends that
allow them, to jump around.

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:45,510
And so here's a mobile element and it's
got, two sequences at the end.

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,253
They're not quite the same but they're
very similar and one is in red and

12
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:51,280
one is in blue.

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,240
And what they do, is they surround two
genes.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:05,380
And those two genes are now known as rag
one and rag two.

15
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,250
And I'll abbreviate it this way.

16
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:13,080
And rag one and rag two, now called the
recombination activating genes,

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,240
were really and integrates for the mobile
element,

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,390
that allow the mobile element to integrate
and hop out of genomes.

19
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,330
So I'm going to draw you the genome of
this ancient jawed fish, and

20
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,260
here is the genome, or a little segment of
the genome.

21
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,540
The place where the mobile element is
destined to hop in.

22
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,710
And here, is an ancient gene that's
going to

23
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,870
turn out to be the immunoglobulin gene.

24
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,310
So this is the ancient immunoglobulin
gene.

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,140
And this mobile element is going to hop
into this gene, just so

26
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,500
and as a result of hopping in at that
location the mobile element

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,140
will split the split the immunoglobulin
gene into two pieces, so

28
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,750
now I'm going to show you the mobile
element as it appears.

29
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,513
Here's the mobile element and here's the
other side of it and

30
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:13,819
it's hopping to that location there and.

31
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:21,085
[SOUND] Okay, and so the ancient
immunoglobulin

32
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:27,259
gene has now been split into 2 pieces and

33
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:32,728
here are the 2 pieces, all right?

34
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:35,160
And it could hop into a 2nd time and

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,660
we'll draw in the mobile element hopping
in the second time.

36
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,250
Imagine, that the same mobile element is
now reversed,

37
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,160
so the red and blue it's turned upside
down.

38
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,510
Well, I'll just turn it upside down for
you.

39
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,140
Here it is.

40
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,509
And turn it backwards.

41
00:02:55,755 --> 00:03:01,050
Cause this is going to happen to hop in,
to this ancient immunoglobulin gene,

42
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,400
just happens to be right next door.

43
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,730
This will be the second hopping event.

44
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:12,780
[COUGH] And what you end up with is two
mobile elements in the genome,

45
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,060
very close together.

46
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,080
So, here's one mobile element and

47
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,101
here is the other mobile element and

48
00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:32,323
it's really the same mobile element

49
00:03:32,323 --> 00:03:38,750
that's happened to two locations.

50
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,640
And it's in the genome.

51
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,890
All right?

52
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,100
And it's ended up splitting the
immunoglobulin gene into three pieces.

53
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,580
These three pieces are now known as the
ancient V region,

54
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,485
ancient D region and ancient J region of
the immunoglobulin heavy chain.

55
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:19,800
[SOUND]
And now imagine that this mobile element.

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,380
So, so we've got three steps now.

57
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,620
Starting with the ancient immunoglobulin
gene,

58
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,050
the ancient gene split into two different
pieces.

59
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,270
So here's, so we, we split the ancient
immunoglobulin gene into two piece, and

60
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:40,010
then with a second insertion of a mobile
element split it into three pieces.

61
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,580
And now we have the genes split into three
pieces.

62
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,430
And then the next step is each of these
little pieces could undergo

63
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,840
a gene duplication.

64
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,490
So, for example, the V region here could
end up getting copied multiple times.

65
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,440
So that you would have multiple V regions
and you'd have multiple D and multiple J.

66
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,540
So I'll just draw what model V regions
would look like, would have the following.

67
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,080
And then, there would be a little v piece,
here.

68
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:21,790
And then, since it's duplicated actually,
let me, make this a neat diagram.

69
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:32,130
So, there's another mobile element another
V segment.

70
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,920
And here's another V segment.

71
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,520
And let me fill in the details.

72
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,289
So, there's a V region.

73
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,330
There's another V region there.

74
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,470
And there's another V region there.

75
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:56,480
So, so what have is, we have this V region
being duplicated into three regions.

76
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,231
So let's call them V1, V2 and V3.

77
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,220
And they arose from the original
primordial V

78
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,060
region via a process called chain
duplication.

79
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,940
And the same thing, this could happen 500
times for V regions and

80
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,630
a dozen times, or four times and a dozen
times for the J region and so on.

81
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:25,480
So you end up with the current and modern,

82
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,560
immunoglobulin heavy chain gene.

83
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,040
So that's what this is.

84
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,300
With after the gene duplications.

85
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,799
So, that's were it all got started.
