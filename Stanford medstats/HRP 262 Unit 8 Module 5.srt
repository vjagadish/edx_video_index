1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,910
[BLANK_AUDIO].

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,774
In this next module, I'm going to show you
how to handle time changing predictors in

3
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:11,601
a generalized estimating equation.

4
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:13,658
[BLANK_AUDIO].

5
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:16,962
So I'm just going to use this same example
data set that I showed you how to

6
00:00:16,962 --> 00:00:18,710
graph in the last module.

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,140
So, this was a data set with just six
people.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,560
And, they're all given a drug that's
supposed to

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,740
make their happy chemical levels, in their
brain, go up.

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,610
And, indeed, you can see, that on average,
this red line is going up a little bit, so

11
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,065
their, chemical levels in the brain are
going up and

12
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:36,871
their depression scores seem to be going
down concurrently.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,135
Just want to show you again the broad form
of the data because I want to point out

14
00:00:42,135 --> 00:00:43,130
one thing.

15
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:49,050
So notice at base line their first
chemical level in the brain measurement.

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,600
I actually made them all have exactly the
same level, to start with.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,390
And there's a reason that I did that.

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:01,470
That ensures that at baseline, see that
everybody has a quite different depression

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,990
scores at baseline, but yet they have the
exact same level of this happy chemical.

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,520
This ensures that at baseline, the
chemical level and

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,450
the depression score are not correlated.

22
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,010
So there are no between subjects effects
at baseline.

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,340
That's going to be important as you'll see
in a few minutes.

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,520
If I were to just hand you these data,
I've got my chemical levels in the brain,

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,390
I've got my depression scores as my
outcome, and

26
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,890
I've got time, you might just think of
analysing then if you didn't know

27
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,900
about generalized estimating equations
with some kind of linear regression.

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,144
So, I am just going to now throw them into
a linear regression to

29
00:01:35,144 --> 00:01:35,936
show you what happens.

30
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:39,889
It's essentially what we're doing, but
again with this extra correction for

31
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:42,230
correlation within subject.

32
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,100
So I'm going to look for linear
correlation between the chemical levels

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,090
and the depression scores, ignoring the
correlation for

34
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,030
now and the near correlation between the
depression scores and time as well.

35
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,540
Just for now ignoring the correlation.

36
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,240
So I'm just showing you those linear
regressions graphically here.

37
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,090
So I graphed the depression score against
time, and

38
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,750
you can see that it does trend downwards
over time.

39
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,980
The beta coefficient for time is negative.

40
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,260
And I also graphed the depression score
against the chemical levels, and there

41
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,960
seems to be a strong inverse relationship
with a higher level of chemical,

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,170
the lower the depression score, the beta
coefficient for chemical is negative.

43
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,200
Of course I've treated this, I've graphed
this and

44
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,830
modeled this as if I have 24 independent
observations.

45
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,050
Clearly I don't.

46
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,100
I have to account for that within subject
correlation.

47
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,608
[BLANK_AUDIO].

48
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:36,088
But I can also run these two together in a
single linear regression model, so I could

49
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:40,290
have chemical and time both as predictors
in the model of depression score.

50
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,610
I went ahead and ran that as well.

51
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,100
Again this is just a regular linear
regression.

52
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,350
What you'll notice is that time is pretty
close to zero.

53
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,250
Doesn't seem to be much of a causing
chemical.

54
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,500
Doesn't seem to be much going on across
time.

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,710
however, the chemical level does have a
strong inverse relationship with

56
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,300
the depression score, and

57
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,190
that does achieve statistical significance
even in this model.

58
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,900
Pay attention to the standard errors,
though.

59
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,600
It turns out that these standard errors
are too high, and

60
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,760
one we run the correct GEE model, those
standard errors will go down.

61
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,310
You can interpret that beta coefficient
for chemical a 100 unit increase

62
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,240
in the chemical would be associated with a
1.7 decrease in the depression score.

63
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,010
Now let me show you the GEE model that
we're going to be running for

64
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,930
for time changing predictors.

65
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,130
Here's what it looks like.

66
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,550
Essentially we're going to have a vector
of outcome variables, that's our

67
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:40,160
depression scores, and we have a vector of
chemical levels, and we are correlating.

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,590
We're getting the linear correlation
between those two vectors across those

69
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,340
four time periods.

70
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,990
There will be just one data coefficient in
the model for

71
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,520
chemical, but it will represent the
correlation between depression score, and

72
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,990
chemical across those four time periods.

73
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,730
And I just want to point out that remember
that when

74
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,350
we ran the time-independent predictors,

75
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,800
we had to put an interaction between the
predictor and time into the model.

76
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,170
When you have time-dependent predictors,
time-changing predictors,

77
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,330
because what you're essentially doing is
modelling this vector of chemical levels,

78
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:21,300
or predictor levels, over time, do not put
an interaction with time into the model.

79
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,590
Time is already incorporated within that
vector of values.

80
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,960
If you did put a time by chemical
interaction here,

81
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,240
it would mean something like there was an
acceleration or

82
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,140
deceleration of the effective chemical and
depression score over time.

83
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,790
That's sort of a higher order effect, and
we wouldn't expect that.

84
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,860
So, I'm just going to put in chemical
level I of one data for that.

85
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,990
Now, the tricky part with time changing
predictors is

86
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,670
how to interpret this beta coefficient
when it comes out at the end of the day.

87
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,590
This beta coefficient is going to
incorporate,

88
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,540
encompass two types of effects.

89
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,770
It's going to encompass between subjects
effects and

90
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,860
within subjects effects, that is, your
score and

91
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,230
your chemical across the different time
periods could be related.

92
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,450
Because they were our between-subjects
effects,

93
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,970
they could also be related if they're are
within-subjects effects.

94
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,770
And when you get the beta coefficient out,

95
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,100
you actually can't differentiate between
those.

96
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,010
And what do I mean by a between-subjects
effect, versus a within-subjects effect?

97
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,680
A between-subjects effect would mean that
you've got two different people.

98
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,340
And, one of them has a higher happy
chemical level in

99
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,610
their brain than the other.

100
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,560
That you would expect the one who has the
higher chemical level,

101
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,900
to on average, have a lower depression
score.

102
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,510
That would be in-between subjects effect.

103
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,020
Within subjects effect, would say that if
you've got one person.

104
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,380
If their chemical level changes over time,

105
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,310
you would expect their depression levels
to also change over time.

106
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,020
If their chemical level goes up, you'd
expect their depression level to go down.

107
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,790
So, when you get that beta out, it could
be be, between subjects effects,

108
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,020
it could be within subjects effects, it
could be both of those and

109
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,290
you can't really differentiate.

110
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,580
So I went ahead and ran this model on
these data just to show you what I'd get.

111
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,800
So first of all it looks a lot like the
linear regression model.

112
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,270
Especially in terms of the betas look very
similar to what we got before.

113
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,980
However the standard errors are much much
smaller.

114
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,870
If you remember the standard error for
time was 0.65.

115
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,630
And it's now more than halved down to
0.28.

116
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,790
The standard error for chemical was
before, 0.055.

117
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,890
Also cut by more than half.

118
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,140
That means our P value for a chemical is
even more significant than before.

119
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,760
So, that's the effective accounting for
the correlation.

120
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,141
But what does this beta coefficient of
negative 0.0129 mean?

121
00:06:41,141 --> 00:06:42,430
How do we interpret it?

122
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:50,405
Well, it could mean that if I've got a
person A who has a chemical level of

123
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:54,230
1,000 in their brain and I've got a person
B who has a chemical level of 900, it.

124
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:00,270
Could mean that we would expect, that A
would be about 1.3 units

125
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,660
lower in depression score than B, because
they are 100 points higher on chemical.

126
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,330
I'll multiplying the beta coefficient by
100 here.

127
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,810
So it could be that.

128
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,157
It could mean that somebody who is 100
points higher would be expected to

129
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:14,910
have about 1.3 lower in depression score.

130
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:22,030
Or it could mean that if Subject A started
at depres chemical level of 900 and then

131
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:28,530
they went up to a chemical level of 1,000,
that we would expect person A to go down.

132
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,220
A change of negative 1.3 in their
depression score.

133
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,790
So that anybody who goes up 100 points
would be expected to go down 1.3 in their

134
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,730
depression score.

135
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,150
It could mean both of those, it could mean
some combination of those,

136
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,300
it could mean only one or the other.

137
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,150
So, interpreting coefficients from
time-dependent predictors is tricky.

138
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,350
And again, I've written out kind of
verbally what I mean by

139
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,060
the between-subjects and within-subjects
if you want to see it written out there.

140
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,060
How do you differentiate?

141
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,350
Well you can't differentiate just by
looking at the beta or

142
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,740
the P value from the model.

143
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,510
You have to look, dig deeper into the
data.

144
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,401
In the next module I'm going to give you
some clues about how to do that.

145
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,729
But I just want to point out here that
since I made up these data,

146
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:11,889
I sort of built in that there would be
more within-subjects effects here than

147
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:14,210
between-subjects effects.

148
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,680
I set everybody at the exact same chemical
level at baseline.

149
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,170
That means that at baseline, there was no
between subjects effects,

150
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,510
your chemical level was unrelated to your
depression level between subjects.

151
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,700
So, I started with no between subjects
effects and then I, I made up the data,

152
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,180
so as I made people go up in their
chemical level,

153
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,010
I made their depression score go down as I
showed you graphically in the last module.

154
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,450
So probably there's a lot more
within-person effects than between-person

155
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:48,230
effects in this data set, and that the
beta would be interpreted more as a change

156
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,450
in your chemical level would correspond
with a change in your depression score.

157
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,060
Just to be complete, I want to talk about
the choice of correlation structure here.

158
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,940
We still have to worry about that.

159
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,870
So, I went ahead, and asked for the
empirical correlation matrix here.

160
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,770
And you can see that these are made up
data so

161
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,540
they don't follow any really predictable
pattern.

162
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:13,570
One time going across went from 0.92, or
0.55, or 0.37.

163
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:18,790
Whereas if you were two time part, points
different, it was at about 0.69, and 0.77.

164
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,610
So there's no real clear pattern here.

165
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,170
What we would choose.

166
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,210
Well, it's clearly not independent.

167
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,060
We might want to go for

168
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,920
exchangeable because, again, since there's
no discernible pattern,

169
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,650
maybe if we just took the average of all
of those we'd do pretty well.

170
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,040
Autoregressive doesn't seem like a good
choice here because the closest time

171
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,280
points don't have larger correlations than
the further time points.

172
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,669
At least not all of them.

173
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,710
Again, for the same reason probably we
don't want to choose independent.

174
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,760
Maybe an unstructured would do well here,
because there is no clear structure here.

175
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,040
So I tried both the exchangeable and
unstructured thinking,

176
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,050
that those would be the most likely to be
a good fit for my model.

177
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,774
Actually I went ahead and

178
00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:02,640
ran Exchangeable, Autoregressive,
3-dependent, and Unstructured.

179
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,860
I ran all of these just to compare.

180
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,110
And if you look at the QICs, the
Exchangeable and

181
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,860
the Unstructured as expected did the best.

182
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,790
In fact, the Unstructured did just a hair
better than the Exchangeable.

183
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,700
And to just show you that it doesn't make
a huge difference,

184
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,990
I ran both the Exchangeable and the
Unstructured.

185
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,240
I'm showing those models here.

186
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,889
I'm showing the robust entered errors.

187
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,310
You can see that the beta coefficients
from both models are pretty similar.

188
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,330
The model I showed you before was with an
exchangeable correlation matrix.

189
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,250
The standard error's just slightly lower
when I chose the unstructured

190
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,822
correlation matrix.

191
00:10:36,822 --> 00:10:39,359
The p values look the same, although if
you look at the disease score,

192
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:42,114
it's a little bit more statistically
significant from the unstructured.

193
00:10:42,114 --> 00:10:45,038
But basically you're getting very, very
similar results.

194
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:47,910
Regardless of your choice of correlation
structure, here.

195
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,919
