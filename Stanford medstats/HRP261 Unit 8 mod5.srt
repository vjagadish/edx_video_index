[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,110
In this next module, I'm going to show you
an evil trick.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,500
If you've got a binary outcome,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,650
you can actually run it in a Poisson
Regression with a little modification and

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,122
it's a way to get adjusted risk ratios and
avoid odds ratios.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,810
So we talked about using Poisson
regression for count data, but it turns

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,940
out that you can actually apply Poisson
regression to binary outcome data as well.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,280
Now, there's a little bit of a problem
here, and so

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,190
let me just explain what the problem is.

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,960
So remember that when you were assuming
that you're on a Poisson distribution,

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,550
you're assuming that the mean and

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,260
the variance are equal, that's true of a
Poisson distribution.

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,300
So that is something that's built into the
Poisson regression.

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,220
Now think about binomial outcomes, okay?

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,350
Binomial variables.

16
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,020
What's the mean for a binomial?

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,460
The mean is n times p.

18
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,380
What's the variance for a binomial?

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,992
Recall that a var, the variance for a
binomial is n times p times 1 minus p.

20
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,470
So what's always going to be the case,
when you're on a binomial distribution,

21
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,050
is that the mean is going to be greater
than the variance.

22
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,300
The variance is actually going to be
smaller than the mean.

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,020
And you can see that because you're always
multiplying the mean times one minus p.

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,830
As long as p is not one or zero, then this
is going to be a fraction.

25
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,400
And so the variance is always going to be
smaller.

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,060
Therefore, if you apply Poisson regression
to binary outcome data,

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,360
you're going to over estimate your
variance and

28
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,110
you're going to over estimate your
standard errors.

29
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,430
So that means your confidence intervals
are going to be too wide.

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,420
Your standard errors are going to be too
big.

31
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,120
Your p values are going to be too big.

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,490
So certainly you don't want to do that
because then you're going to

33
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,620
lose statistical power unnecessarily.

34
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,510
However, there is a simple modification
that researchers have figured out that you

35
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,790
can do to the Poisson regression to get to
the correct standard errors.

36
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,690
And that's something called applying
robust standard errors.

37
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,750
And it's fairly easy to do in most
standard statistical packages.

38
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,440
It's just a simple line of code.

39
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,100
And so this is great because now you can
take any situation where you've

40
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,740
got binary outcome data and rather than
running a logistic regression you could

41
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,470
instead choose to simply run a Poisson
regression with this modification.

42
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,010
What does that buy you?

43
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,650
Well, if you have a common outcome what
that buys you is that you're

44
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,030
going to get risk ratios.

45
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,140
The Poisson gives you these incidence rate
ratios which can be

46
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,260
interpreted as risk ratios.

47
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,470
Risk ratios are not misleading if you have
a common outcome,

48
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,230
odds ratios are misleading.

49
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,700
I'll just refer you to the reference for
this modification it's a 2004 paper.

50
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,800
This author shows, through simulation,

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,840
that this is a reasonable thing to do with
binary outcome data.

52
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,860
Now I haven't seen this applied too widely
in the literature, but

53
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,470
one can make an argument that whenever you
have a common outcome, it's probably

54
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,720
preferable to analyze the data this way,
than to do them in logistic regression.

55
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,780
Because of the fact that,

56
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,330
again, those odds ratios that come out of
logistic regression can be so misleading.

57
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,510
You can try to interpret those odds ratios
well for your readers, but

58
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,570
they still can be misleading, even if you
do a good job in the write up, so.

59
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,710
Just to give you an example of how this
works,

60
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,460
I'm going to go back to that data set that
I have on runners.

61
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,640
150 different women distance runners.

62
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,158
The outcome that we were looking at in an
earlier module was menstrual irregularity

63
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:34,540
and 33% of the runners in my sample had
menstrual irregularity.

64
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,050
Either amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea.

65
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,450
And now I'm going to use that outcome,

66
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,460
that kind of inclusive outcome as the
outcome for

67
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,000
logistic regression because I want to make
it as common as possible.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,520
Just to show you how the odds ratios get
inflated.

69
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,850
The more common the outcome, the more the
odds ratio are inflated.

70
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,650
The predictor of interest that we were
looking at is a score on

71
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,100
an eating disorder questionnaire.

72
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,200
I'm abbreviating that as the EDIA.

73
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,300
So I went ahead and ran a logistic
regression first.

74
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,930
Again, common outcome.

75
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,690
I get out my odds ratios for the EDIA
score.

76
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,560
This is the odds ratio for a one unit
increase in your eating disorder score.

77
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,350
It's highly statistical significant.

78
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,220
The odds ratio comes out to be 1.12.

79
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,530
You would interpret this as a 12% increase
in your

80
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,260
odds of having menstrual irregularity for

81
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,310
every one point increase in your score on
this eating disorder questionnaire.

82
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,980
Remember, this isn't increase in odds
though, because my outcome is common, so

83
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,370
we would not want to misinterpret this as
an increase in your risk, or

84
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,770
the prevalence of menstrual irregularity.

85
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,250
But, I can also run these same data with
this binary outcome of menstrual

86
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:45,410
irregularity in a Poisson regression with
these robust standard errors.

87
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,940
And that's what I've done here.

88
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,060
And so here's my predictor variable,

89
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,350
EDIA here's my beta coefficient, and
here's my standard error,

90
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,830
this is the robust standard error, so now
these standard errors will be correct.

91
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,650
You can see that I indeed get a highly
statistically significant effect for

92
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,050
eating disorders scored, just as before.

93
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,960
But now I can take this beta coefficient
and I can exponentiate it and what I

94
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,700
get out are these relative risks, these
risk ratios, rather than odds ratios.

95
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,679
And if I had other things in the model, I
would be getting out adjusted risk ratios.

96
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,020
I am going to use the beta coefficient
this computer output also gave me

97
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,230
the 95% confidence interval for this beta
coefficient, if I exponentiate these,

98
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,780
I will get the 95% confidence interval for
the odds ratio.

99
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,470
I mean starting for the risk ratio.

100
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:40,414
So, let me just do that now, so I'm going
to exponentiate the 0.0653.

101
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:45,530
When I exponentiate that, I get that the
point estimate for

102
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:50,700
my odds ratio is one, sorry for my risk
ratio is 1.067.

103
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,490
So this is an incidence rate ratio of
course,

104
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,430
in this case we're talking about cross
sectional data.

105
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,850
So it's really technically called a
prevalence ratio, so you could

106
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,220
interpret this as, for every one unit
increase in the eating disorder score.

107
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,420
You have a 6.7% increase in your
prevalence of or

108
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,700
risk of menstrual irregularity.

109
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,450
We can also do the 95% confidence limits,
so if I exponentiate those confidence

110
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:22,360
limits from the previous page, I get a
lower bound of about 0.04, 1.04.

111
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:29,143
And an upper bound of about 1.096.

112
00:06:29,143 --> 00:06:33,220
So that can be interpreted as the adjusted
risk ratio.

113
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,590
You don't need to worry about this
business about odds ratios being

114
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,390
misleading, you can avoid them altogether.

115
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:44,780
And just to compare, remember when we did
the odds ratio from logistic regression,

116
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,010
what we got there was point estimate of
1.12 and

117
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:54,261
a 95% confidence interval of 1.06 to 1.1
about 1.19.

118
00:06:54,261 --> 00:07:00,580
So the width of the confidence interval is
similar here but these are all inflated.

119
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,480
And somebody could misinterpret those as
increases in,

120
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,444
in risk rather than increases in odds.

121
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:09,580
So sometimes it's nice just to be able to
directly report risk ratios and

122
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,010
this is one way to do that.
