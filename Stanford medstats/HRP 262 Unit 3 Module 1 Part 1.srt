2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,560
In this next module I'm going to introduce
you to Cox regression.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,750
So in this module we're going to get to

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,630
the multivariate regression technique
called Cox regression.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,900
So Cox regression is sometimes also called
proportional hazards regression, and

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,780
that's because inherent in Cox regression
is this

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,270
assumption called the proportional hazard
assumption that's very essential.

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,110
And we'll talk about what that is, so
you'll sometime see it called that.

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,970
It's a multivariate regression technique
that you use when you

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,820
have time-to-event outcomes.

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,169
And it's the most commonly used regression
technique for this type of outcome data.

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,780
What do you get out of Cox regression?

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,360
What you get out of Cox regression is
simply adjusted hazard ratios.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,950
You actually don't get anything else,
there's no intercept,

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,250
you're not going to get an estimate of the
underlying hazard function or

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,100
the underlying survival function, you're
just going to get the hazard ratios.

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,560
But that's often okay, because often all
we care about is what is

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,130
the effect of age, or treatment, or
smoking on the outcome, and

19
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,000
we don't care so much about what the
underlying function looks like.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,520
Just to compare with parametric
regression, which we did last week,

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,980
here's some results from an exponential
regression that we ran on data that were

22
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,630
comparing people with active hepatitis.

23
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,350
Some received steroids and some were in a
control group, and

24
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,420
it was comparing time to death.

25
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,830
When we fit an exponential model,

26
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,470
we're assuming that the hazard rate is
constant over time.

27
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:37,070
So that model, for the control here, which
is in red, the hazard rate was

28
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:43,245
about 1.1% up per month of time, 1.1%
chance of death every month.

29
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:46,990
So that was quite high compared with the
steroid treated group,

30
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,410
which had a much lower hazard rate every
month of about .5%.

31
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,740
That corresponded to, that we could
actually draw out these

32
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,480
nice smooth survival curves that you see
on the right hand side here.

33
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,090
What cause regression does is it says,

34
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:06,360
well what if I don't care exactly what the
absolute value for the hazard rates is,

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,350
and what if I don't care to actually draw
out these smooth survival curves?

36
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,490
What if what I care about from this study
is just what's

37
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,100
the difference between the treatment group
and the control group?

38
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,040
What's the relative difference in
mortality rates?

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,020
A lot of times that's all I'm after, and
that's what Cox regression does.

40
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,860
It says let's not bother to estimate this
hazard, this underlying hazard function,

41
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,490
let's just estimate the difference between
these two lines,

42
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,560
the relative difference in the hazard
rates.

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,920
The assumption here, of course, is that
there is a single relative difference.

44
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,070
Since the hazard rate can change over
time,

45
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,820
it could be the case that the hazard ratio
could also change over time.

46
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,670
If the hazard rate went up in one group
but

47
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,430
down in another over time, then there
wouldn't be a single hazard ratio.

48
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,570
But what we're going to try to do in Cox
regression is say,

49
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,210
well, if the relative difference between
the two groups is constant over time,

50
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,230
as it is if we're assuming an exponential
here,

51
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,160
then we can estimate the relative
difference between those groups.

52
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,630
We can estimate that hazard ratio and we
won't bother to estimate anything else.

53
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,040
So, in this case, you can see we were, you
know,

54
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,442
again, the, the rate in the control group
was somewhere around 1.1% versus

55
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:21,630
about 0.5% in the treated group, so that
would translate to a hazard ratio for

56
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,600
treatment versus control that's some where
around 0.4 or 0.5.

57
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,870
And maybe that's all we'll estimate.

58
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,160
And in fact, when we ran a Cox regression
on these data I showed you briefly last

59
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,680
week, that if you run a Cox regression on
these data,

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,260
in fact, all you get out is a hazard
ratio.

61
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,760
The hazard ratio comparing treatment
versus control was about 0.43,

62
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,190
saying that the treated group had about a
57% decrease in their mortality rate.

63
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,780
And this was statistically significant.

64
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,920
Notice the output from our maximum
likelihood estimation in SAS for

65
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,370
Cox regression has no intercept.

66
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,040
This is it.

67
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,270
Just the treatment versus control.

68
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,780
That was the only predictor in the model.

69
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,630
No intercept here, we're not bothering to
estimate the intercept.

70
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,320
But we can still get that hazard ratio,
which is what we care about in this case.

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,250
So what does the model actually look like?

72
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,720
It's the same basic model as we used for
parametric regression.

73
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,500
We're modeling the log hazard.

74
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,440
We're modeling the log hazard as a
function of some baseline hazard,

75
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,890
which may change over time, plus some
increase or

76
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,880
decrease in that baseline hazard function,
depending on your risk factors.

77
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,100
The key to Cox regression, however, is we
are not going to commit ourselves to

78
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,690
any particular form for the underlying
baseline hazard function.

79
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,050
We're going to end up canceling it out in
the likelihood, and

80
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,730
not bothering to estimate it.

81
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:46,960
So that means that it would be perfectly
fine if your log hazard for

82
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,430
a particular group looks something like
this.

83
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,940
So maybe this is you know, some weird
function.

84
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,530
So maybe this is my reference group, this
is the log reference for

85
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,600
my reference group.

86
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,890
And then maybe my smoking group looks
something like this, it's kind of similar,

87
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,340
weird function over time, no easy
mathematical function to describe that.

88
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,660
But as long as the difference between my
smoking group and

89
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,780
my control group is roughly kind of the
same at all different time points,

90
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,020
then we can estimate the difference
between those curves,

91
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,410
the relative difference, and that is the
hazard ratio.

92
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,160
And we're just going to estimate that.

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,450
And the hazard ratio will be represented
by the betas in the model, betas for

94
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,130
all of our risk factors, such as smoking
and age and so on.

95
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,060
So what we're going to get out of the
model is we're going to cancel out those

96
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,990
baseline hazard functions and only
estimate the betas.

97
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,590
And if you exponentiate the betas, you get
hazard ratio.

98
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,750
So let me show you that now.

99
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,640
If you take the betas for, from the Cox
regression model and

100
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,050
you just directly exponentiate them, you
will get the adjusted hazard ratio for

101
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,680
that particular predictor, and that's just
shown here.

102
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,790
So imagine that we've got a Cox regression
model that we fit and

103
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,820
we have smoking and age in the model.

104
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,110
I've got, say in my, I want to do the
hazard ratio for a smoker versus

105
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,200
a non-smoker, so I'm going to take the
hazard ratio estimate from the model for

106
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,490
the smoker versus the non-smoker.

107
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,170
But I'm not going to fill in anything
particular for

108
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,400
the baseline hazard function, which again,
is allowed to change over time.

109
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,450
But I'm going to assume that they both
have the same underlying kind of bate,

110
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,220
shape of that baseline hazard function.

111
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,670
I'm going to assume it's the same for

112
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,900
both, but that the smoker gets additional,
gets an additional increase in

113
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,400
the hazard at all times because of the
fact that they're smoking.

114
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,950
I also have beta age, I have age in the
model here.

115
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,988
And I'm just going to hold age fixed,

116
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:39,899
because that's what it needs to adjust in
the regression model.

117
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,085
So as long as we're holding age fixed,
those are going to cancel,

118
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:46,235
the underlying baseline hazard functions
are going to cancel.

119
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:49,667
And all we're going to be left with is
that the smoker compared to

120
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:53,033
the non-smoker, if we have a binary
variable for smoking,

121
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:57,455
if I exponentiate that beta for smoking,
that will give me the hazard ratios for

122
00:06:57,455 --> 00:07:02,040
say, the outcome here being lung cancer,
for smokers versus non-smokers.

123
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,210
Adjusted for everything else in the model,
and notice that I never had

124
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:09,520
to specify the baseline hazard function in
order to get the hazard ratio.

125
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,000
I can just cancel it out.

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,400
So this would represent, if I take the
beta for smoking and exponentiate it,

127
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,090
I get the hazard ratio for smoking, in
this case adjusted for age.

128
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,500
Just to remind you that we can get hazard
ratios for continuous predictors, as well.

129
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:30,980
So, if I wanted to look at the hazard
ratio for age, adjusted for

130
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,140
smoking, so from that same model, how
would I get the hazard ratio for age?

131
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,400
Well, I'm going to say, again,

132
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,720
I want to to compare somebody who's older
to somebody who's younger.

133
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,240
So this would be the hazard for somebody
who's older divided by the hazard for

134
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,590
somebody who's younger.

135
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,890
If I assume that they have the same
underlying baseline hazard function,

136
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,960
I can cancel them out, I don't need to
bother to estimate them.

137
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,010
I'm going to fix smoking, say they're both
non-smokers, or

138
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,280
I could have said that they're both
smokers, so that those will cancel out.

139
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,170
So all I'm left with here is e raised to
beta age.

140
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,480
And let's say I want to compare somebody
who's ten years older to somebody who's

141
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,920
ten years younger, then it would just be
beta age times 10.

142
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,710
I would then exponentiate, that would give
me the hazard ratio for

143
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,290
a ten unit jump in age.

144
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,420
It works exactly the same as when we
exponentiated‎ betas from a logistic

145
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,600
regression model, except now we're getting
hazard ratios instead of odds ratios.

146
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,830
Now the key assumption here is that we
have proportional hazards.

147
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,980
What I mean by proportional hazards is, is
that the hazard ratio is

148
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:39,860
constant over time, that the, the, those
two hazard curves are parallel over time.

149
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,960
Otherwise, that hazard ratio would be
changing over time.

150
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,890
There are many ways that

151
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,460
we're going to learn to test the
proportional hazard assumption.

152
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,820
One of the simplest ways is to generate
this log-log plot that we

153
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,258
talked about last week.

154
00:08:51,258 --> 00:08:54,002
If the log-log plot is parallel, then that
would tell you

155
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:56,970
that the underlined hazard functions were
also parallel, and

156
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,961
therefore that the proportional hazards
assumption was met.

157
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:01,774
So we're looking for parallel lines here.

158
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,957
This is the log, log plot for the steroid
data.

159
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:06,985
And so this will show you well,

160
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:11,450
it's not a perfectly parallel set of lines
between the two groups.

161
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,490
You can see that it's a little bit
narrower,

162
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,640
closer together at the beginning and a
little bit further apart at the end.

163
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,620
But as real data go, this isn't terrible.

164
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,780
These lines look reasonably parallel as,
you know, as real data go, so

165
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,150
probably proportional hazards assumption
would be close enough here.

166
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,910
That's one way to test, to test that
proportional hazards assumption,

167
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,610
we're going to talk about a whole bunch of
other ways.
