00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,930
Hello students, we will learn about the
polymerase chain reaction.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,050
PCR can amplify a single copy of DNA into
millions of copies.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,480
It is a chain reaction that uses DNA
polymerase.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,690
Unlike the uranium chain reaction, which
created the boom of an atomic bomb.

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,930
The polymorase chain reaction, created
bloom for biomedical research.

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,580
So what makes PCR go?

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,370
You need several components.

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,940
One, DNA.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,350
Two, all of the nucleotide primers.

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,360
Three, deoxynucleotide triphosphates.

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,130
Four, DNA polymerase, of course.

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,343
And five, thermal cycling, where the
temperature changes in

13
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:52,290
a cycle to allow the proper reactions to
occur.

14
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,490
So, I've drawn at the top of the figure
here a double-stranded DNA

15
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,440
molecule with the five prime and three
prime ends labeled.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,170
And the three prime end at the arrow
heads.

17
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:16,040
The first step is to raise the temperature
to denature the DNA molecules.

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:22,685
So, I'll draw them, the two strands
separated as if they are denatured.

19
00:01:22,685 --> 00:01:29,880
[BLANK_AUDIO]

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,229
The second step is to lower the
temperature

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,350
to allow the primers to anneal.

22
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,870
So the primer, one primer will anneal at
this point, and

23
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,910
the other primer will anneal at this
point.

24
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,780
And then, the third step is to elongate.

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,289
And then as a result, the DNA polymerase.

26
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:06,020
We'll copy the template strand, and extend
from the primer.

27
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,500
Now we have two DNA molecules.

28
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,160
And we simply repeat the same sequence of
events of, in a second cycle, cycle two.

29
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,410
Where we denature, anneal, and elongate.

30
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,926
So I am going to draw the four strands in
order.

31
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:38,800
[BLANK_AUDIO]

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,150
You can tell the strands by the, the
length here in the diagram.

33
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:54,760
[BLANK_AUDIO]

34
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:03,750
Okay, that's the denatration step and now
we are going to anneal the primers.

35
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,120
So here's one primer annealing here,
always in the same place.

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,180
Must be four.

37
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,860
And then DNA polymerase will be logged

38
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:26,471
[BLANK_AUDIO]

39
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:33,923
So, after 20 cycles you'll

40
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:43,389
have just about 1 million molecules.

41
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,030
And virtually, all the molecules will be
the same length.

42
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,050
They will be the length of the DNA spanned
by the two primers.

43
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,168
Okay, so that's the basics of the PCR
reaction.

44
00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:08,980
Now, there are some variations on that
theme.

45
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,000
First of all, you may have other DNA
present in the mix

46
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,930
that is completely different.

47
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,210
Except, it happens to have sequences that
are close enough to the,

48
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,995
to, to the sequence in the primers that
there can be hybridization of the primers.

49
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:33,900
[SOUND]
So, for example,

50
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,360
you can have a primer

51
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,540
[BLANK_AUDIO]

52
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,050
Hybridizing there and the second primer
hybridizing there.

53
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,460
If that occurs

54
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,610
[BLANK_AUDIO]

55
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,910
then we'll get elongation

56
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,657
[BLANK_AUDIO]

57
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:08,390
And copying of a different template
strand.

58
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,540
So that after 20 cycles,

59
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:16,700
[BLANK_AUDIO]

60
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:24,865
We would have DNA fragments that will have
the sequence of the original primers.

61
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:31,594
[BLANK_AUDIO]
But spanning

62
00:05:31,594 --> 00:05:37,964
a completely

63
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:44,914
different DNA

64
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:49,640
sequence.

65
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,050
Sequence which I have marked in green.

66
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,100
Another bad thing can happen.

67
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,500
And that is the two primers may actually
be complementary at

68
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,399
their three prime ends.

69
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,710
If you haven't designed them properly.

70
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,140
And so they could actually hybridize nose
to nose.

71
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,130
And if that happens, after 20 cycles.

72
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:26,130
[BLANK_AUDIO]

73
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,430
You could have what's called a primer
dimer.

74
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:41,130
[BLANK_AUDIO]

75
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,668
Now, the primer dimer, of course, is
going to be a different size from

76
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:52,609
the amplicon that you're looking for in
the target DNA.

77
00:06:52,609 --> 00:07:03,200
And similarly, the mismatched sequence of
the, the mismatched,

78
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:09,680
sequence, from the other DNA fragment in
green will have a different size.

79
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,480
And you can distinguish all of these by
doing gel electrophoresis.

80
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,369
Which would separate all of the different
species according to size.

81
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,330
Now, there is another variation and

82
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:35,460
that is that the DNA, the target DNA may
actually not be intact.

83
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,660
So, in that situation, you would have a
primer hybridizing here,

84
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,340
and a primer hybridizing here.

85
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:52,300
And then, you would get extension, or
elongation.

86
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,230
But on the bottom strand,

87
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,520
the elongation will only go up to the gap
because the pointers can't jump the gap.

88
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,111
But after 20 more cycles, [SOUND]
you would have

89
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:08,760
[BLANK_AUDIO]

90
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:18,580
A 1 million fragments of your original
target DNA

91
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,488
[BLANK_AUDIO]

92
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:25,230
So.

93
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:32,030
In summary, PCR has many desirable
properties.

94
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,950
It's sensitive.

95
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,208
Extremely so, because you can get a
million copies of a single DNA molecule.

96
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:47,290
It's quite specific, but not precisely, as
we explained.

97
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,210
And it's robust, because the DNA doesn't
have to be perfectly intact.

98
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,339
But it has to be reasonably intact.

99
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,750
So there you have it.

100
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,200
The Polymerase Chain Reaction.

101
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,740
Thank you.
