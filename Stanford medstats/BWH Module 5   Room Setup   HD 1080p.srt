00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:26,058
Welcome back.

3
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:27,180
I'm Dr. Larry Chu.

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,670
Hi, and I'm Dr. Agnieszka Trzcinka.

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,175
Now in this segment, we're going to talk
about something that's a little

6
00:00:33,175 --> 00:00:38,390
anxiety-producing for residents who are
new to cardiac anesthesia, and

7
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,170
that is setting up the room.

8
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,140
There's a lot different things we need to
do to set up the room.

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,325
We want to give you an overview of that.

10
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:47,960
Agnieszka, can you tell us a little bit
about what you're going to cover in

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,790
your lecture?

12
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,770
Of course.

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,380
So setting up cardiac OR, takes up more
time than preparation for other cases.

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,240
So make sure you give yourself extra time
to do so.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,230
The things that we're going to focus on is
the setting up anesthesia machine,

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,340
airway equipment, all the proper managers,
infusion lines, supplies for

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,710
line placements, all the medications that
you will need for the case, as well

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,209
as trying to coordinate the equipment for
TEE examination, if it's needed.

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,880
Wonderful.

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,030
I can't wait to see your lecture.

21
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,430
Let's get started.

22
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,665
The following presentation outlines
information on basic cardiac OR

23
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:26,680
set-up as it is done at the Brigham and
Women's Hospital.

24
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,240
Please be aware that the set-up might be
different at your institution.

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,220
You should start in a step-wise fashion
making sure that you

26
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,830
have a working section.

27
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,620
Perform standard anesthesia machine
checkout, and have all necessary airway

28
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,040
equipment including a large 8.0 or 8.5
endotracheal tube.

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,410
The equipment in a cardiac OR

30
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,610
includes standard ASA monitors, plus the
following devices.

31
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,150
Triple transducer with pressure bag.

32
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,550
Reflex transducer corresponding to
arterial line,

33
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,320
yellow transducer corresponding to PA
catheter, and blue one to CVP monitoring.

34
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:13,786
Head of the bed set up includes
defibrillator pads, which are located in

35
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:19,927
the OR supply cabinet, defibrillator
3-lead EKG, and standard 5-lead EKG.

36
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:23,630
You may also place a jaw pad as a cushion
under patient's head.

37
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:31,460
Equipment in the pocket of the right pole
includes fibrillator and pacer.

38
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,520
Make sure that you test batteries for the
pacer.

39
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,760
And test fibrillator for

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,900
power to ensure that both devices will
work properly during the case.

41
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,280
Defibrillator is located on the right side
of the bed,

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,120
and is usually tested by the nursing
staff.

43
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,370
But please make sure that the cable is
connected to the defibrillator pads placed

44
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,000
on patient.

45
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,150
Cardiac anesthesia carts are different, so
familiarize yourself with the drawers.

46
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,500
Cardiac non-controlled medications are in
the top drawer and include most of

47
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,650
the resuscitation medications that may be
needed during the case.

48
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,910
You may have to obtain them from pharmacy
for the first case of the day.

49
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,930
On top of the cart, place the medications
that will be needed for

50
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,250
beginning stages of the case.

51
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,660
If possible, fill out the medication
request sheet.

52
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,170
And leave it at the pharmacy the night
before scheduled surgery, so

53
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,650
that the medications will be ready for
pick up, saving your time in the morning.

54
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,080
The requested medications may vary
depending on patients' past

55
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,740
medical history and planned surgery.

56
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,290
However, the usual induction syringes
include standard emergency

57
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,787
syringes of phenylephrine, ephedrine,
atropine and

58
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:55,625
succinylcholine, and additional syringes
for fentanyl, propofol or

59
00:03:55,625 --> 00:04:00,983
etomidate, non-depolarizing neuromuscular
blocking agent,

60
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:06,437
esmolol, phenylephrine diluted to 40
mcg/mL concentration,

61
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:11,890
epinephrine diluted to 8 mcg/mL or 4 mcg/L
concentration, and

62
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,510
nitroglycerin diluted to 40 mcg/mL
concentration.

63
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:21,510
Also, confirm presence of heparin in your
cardiac kit, and

64
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,200
place it on the top of the cart as well.

65
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,420
Some extra medications that can be kept on
the side wing of the blue

66
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:35,510
cart include albumin, but only if the
attending has specified its use,

67
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,393
cardiac drips in pre-mixed bags of
phenylephrine 320 mcg/mL,

68
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:48,910
epinephrine 16 mcg/mL, and norepinephrine
32 mcg/mL,

69
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,770
aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid,
again, only if your attending has

70
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:59,690
specified its use, insulin drip and
antibiotics which for cardiac cases

71
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,690
usually include vancomycin and cefazolin
administered based on patient's weight.

72
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,720
On the left pole, you can set up the fluid
warmer and four-channel Alaris pump.

73
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,700
You may organize your infusions in which
ever way makes sense to you.

74
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,020
Here, we have an example from the left, of
Amicar infusion, VIP line,

75
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,450
which is a vasoactive infusion port with
1L normosol on

76
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,600
microdrip with a gang of four, and
cefazolin.

77
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,860
On the right pole, you can set up your
bolus line,

78
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,320
with 1L normosol on half of walrus tubing
attached to gang of four.

79
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,920
Central line will be placed in patient
after induction.

80
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,472
You can set up a tray with all necessary
supplies that include four

81
00:05:52,472 --> 00:05:57,790
triple-lumen catheter, miltilumen CVC kit,

82
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:04,710
mayo stand cover, one sterile half-sheet,
one set of gloves, gown,

83
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,490
probe cover for ultrasound, central line
dressing kit, and two sterile flushes.

84
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,760
Depending on the case,

85
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,260
you may be told that patient needs central
venous access via Cordis with a slic.

86
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:26,160
Cordis is an introducer sheath that can be
used for rapid volume delivery

87
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,070
during resuscitation or for subsequent
placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter.

88
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,100
Slic is a single lumen infusion catheter.

89
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,620
However, most often in clinical practice,
there is,

90
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,680
refers to triple-lumen catheter that locks
into the top of a Cordis.

91
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,500
Please discuss with the attending what
central line access is needed for

92
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,607
the case and set-up accordingly.

93
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,910
Thank you very much for watching and good
luck.

94
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,060
Wonderful lecture.

95
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,040
Learned a lot.

96
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,030
Great pictures, I love pictures.

97
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,920
I learn so much visually.

98
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,000
Now Agnieszka, one thing that I would love
to do though is to

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,109
try to place those pictures in a frame of
reference to the room itself.

100
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,310
Would you be willing to walk around the
room with me so

101
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,970
we can kind of see where everything goes?

102
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,160
Of course, let's get started.

103
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:24,410
All right, Agnieszka, so, I really would
love for you, you to show me in the same

104
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,120
order that you did your talk earlier where
things are located in the room.

105
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,340
Can we start that way?

106
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,790
Of course, let's get started.

107
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,010
So, as in the presentation, we're going to
start at the anesthesia workstation,

108
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,520
making sure that the anesthesia machine is
properly checked out for

109
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,140
the day, and that we have all of the
airway equipment nicely laid out.

110
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,390
And, ensuring that we have a large 8.0 or
8.5 endotracheal tube.

111
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,630
Perfect, what's next?

112
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,790
Of course, let's focus on the monitors.

113
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,160
So as we head in toward the bed, we have
the triple transducer,

114
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,736
we have the defibrillator 3-lead EKG,

115
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:06,230
standard ASA 5-lead EKG, as well as the
defibrillator pads.

116
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:14,300
On the right side of the bed, we have the
pacer, fibrillator, and defibrillator.

117
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,250
Make sure that the cable from the
defibrillator is connected to our

118
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,670
defibrillator pads before we get the case
started.

119
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,970
So, that's actually a really important
point because sometimes people forget

120
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,380
to connect it to the cable.

121
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,690
And of course, if you want to activate
that in an emergency,

122
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,610
you need to have it connected already.

123
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,890
That's right, that's [UNKNOWN].

124
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,818
Okay, what's next?

125
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:41,400
All right, let's focus on the anesthesia
cart, which is right here.

126
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:47,640
So keep in mind that the anesthesia, cart
in a cardiac room is quite different.

127
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,160
Remember that in our first drawer,

128
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,400
we have the non-controlled resuscitation
medications.

129
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,652
And then on the top of our cart, we have
all of the medications needed for

130
00:08:58,652 --> 00:09:02,660
induction in beginning stages of the case.

131
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,570
Here in the bucket on the side, here, we
have some extra medications.

132
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,560
And just as we discussed in the PowerPoint
presentation,

133
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,530
discuss with the attendings which extra
medications you may

134
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,960
need before you check them out from the
pharmacy.

135
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,680
Now one thing that I'll note is that for
cardiac anesthesia, often,

136
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,580
your carts are different than the carts
for pediatrics or general anesthesia.

137
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,480
And so you may wish to look at the cart at
your institution and familiarize it

138
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,780
with yourself, especially when you're just
beginning cardiac anesthesia.

139
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,218
myself, I notice one thing that's missing
from your cart and that's protamine.

140
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:39,000
Mm-hm.

141
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,790
Is there a reason that you just don't have
it here available because so

142
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,780
it'd be convenient for dosing?

143
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,580
Simply because it's very important to
administer protamine

144
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,580
at exactly the right time during the
surgery,

145
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,410
making sure that you really converse with
the surgeon about when to give it.

146
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,234
And so for the safety factor at the
Brigham and

147
00:09:56,234 --> 00:10:00,765
Women's Hospital, we do not keep it in our
anesthesia cart but rather,

148
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:06,220
we keep it all across the room in the
cardiac, OR, nursing staff room.

149
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,980
And when the time comes for the protamine,
administration, we ask for

150
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,728
the protamine to be brought to us.

151
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:12,414
Great.

152
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:16,700
And Dr. Weyden will have a great lecture
about protamine and heparin, and why it's

153
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,800
important for us to institute these safety
measures, later in the course.

154
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,550
Well, let's continue.

155
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,260
What's next?

156
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,860
Sure.

157
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,910
Let's go to the left side of our bed.

158
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,040
Here, we have the fluid warmers set up,

159
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,500
as well as the four-channel Alaris
infusion pump.

160
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:40,060
here, we also have the VIP which stands
for the vasoactive infusion port.

161
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:44,180
Every institution might be a little bit
different how we set this up.

162
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,850
At the Brigham, we set up on their micro
dripper connected to this gang of four.

163
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,130
However, at your institution, you may
connect this line and program your

164
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:59,090
Alaris pump to deliver a certain, rate of
the, infusion to the patient.

165
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,910
So, check with the attending before you
set this up.

166
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,970
Wonderful.

167
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,730
And, finally, what's, what's next?

168
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,450
All right.

169
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,180
So, we move on to the right side of the
bed.

170
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,570
And right here on the right pole, we
always have a set up for the bolus line.

171
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,040
And here we just have a regular tubing
with the gang of four, set up and

172
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,040
ready to go, for infusion to the patient
when the central line is placed.

173
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,820
Talking about central lines, do you have
all that equipment?

174
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,900
We certainly do.

175
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,630
We can move on over here.

176
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,790
And here we have a tray with all of the
unopened supplies needed for

177
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,650
the placement of the central line.

178
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,720
Please refer to the PowerPoint
presentation and

179
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,580
what exactly you may need, for the central
line placement.

180
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,828
Well, I see it's really nice to have all
your equipment organized in one place on

181
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:47,528
the Mayo stand, so that you can access it
quickly.

182
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:51,376
And more importantly, what I've noticed
from your set up, Agnieszka,

183
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:55,713
is that it's very standardized, so you
know, that you have everything you need.

184
00:11:55,713 --> 00:11:57,320
You know where it is.

185
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,180
And, and how to get it quickly.

186
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,780
That's correct.

187
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,630
It helps to [UNKNOWN] take out the
equation when

188
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,380
perhaps things gets stressful when you're
taking care of a sick patient,

189
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,070
knowing exactly when things are in a room
and how things are set up.

190
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:09,870
Wonderful.

191
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,200
Yup.

192
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,590
Great.
That was a lot of fun.

193
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,210
I have a better sense now of where
everything is in the room, but

194
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,240
I do have a question for you.

195
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,130
Mm-hm.

196
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,010
What do you do when you don't have an hour
to set up a room?

197
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,440
What if a heart comes crash and

198
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,730
back for take back or, or you have an
emergent cardiac surgery,

199
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:33,606
tell me what are the essential things that
I need to do to get a room ready quickly.

200
00:12:33,606 --> 00:12:37,500
For emergency cases, you will have to
focus on the basics,

201
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,720
making sure you have a working anesthesia
machine, proper airway equipment to

202
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,535
be able to intubate the patient, induction
medications and

203
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:50,240
vasopressors diluted properly to ensure
the induction's done safely.

204
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,030
You may also call for extra help to be
able to

205
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,889
bring extra equipment that is necessary
for emergent case.

206
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,750
Wonderful.

207
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,080
Well you know, I feel so much better about
setting up a room now.

208
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,770
I think, you know, to summarize what we
learned here.

209
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,890
We learned that setting up a room really
involves time whenever possible.

210
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,470
Get there early, it's better to get there
early and

211
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,390
get your room set up and be prepared.

212
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,040
and, and that involves getting your
airway, your drugs,

213
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,890
your infusions, your line, your
equipment's set up.

214
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,940
And that's really the process that, of
anticipating and planning your needs.

215
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,060
And if you're organized, and you have
everything set up in a regimented,

216
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,035
standardized fashion, which many
institutions do.

217
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:31,780
Mm-hm.

218
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,090
Then you're going to be able to make sure
you're always prepared.

219
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,018
And isn't it great to be prepared?

220
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:36,767
Indeed.

221
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:40,761
And, we hope this module's help prepare
you a little bit better for

222
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:42,802
your cardiac anesthesia rotation.

223
00:13:42,802 --> 00:13:44,436
And we'll see you next time.

224
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:45,344
Thank you.

225
00:13:45,344 --> 00:13:46,024
Bye.

226
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:56,024
