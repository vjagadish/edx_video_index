1
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,620
In this next module, I'm going to talk
about multiple linear regression.

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,780
This is when we now going to add multiple
predictors to our regression model.

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,840
This allows us to do all kind of wonderful
things like improve our predictions and

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,331
statistically adjust for confounders.

5
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:28,170
[SOUND] Multiple linear regression just
means that you're adding more than

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,530
one predictor to the model, so

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,950
the right side of our regression equation
is now going to get bigger.

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,140
It's going to look something like this.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,040
So this now, our expected value of y we
can predict is equal to

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,660
an intercept plus a slope corresponding to
one predictor variable,

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,750
another slope corresponding to another
predictor variable, so maybe even

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,490
a third variable in the model, so we can
put multiple variables in the model.

13
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,630
Those predictors can be continuous
variables.

14
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,320
They can be binary variables.

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,140
They can be categorical variables.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,180
We'll talk more about that in the next
module.

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,280
Each regression coefficient, the way that
we interpret it is, it's the amount

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,990
of change in the outcome variable that
would be expected for one-unit change in

19
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,460
the predictor if all other variables in
the model were held constant.

20
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,960
So it's trying to get at the independent
effects of, say, X.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,080
If you hold W and Z here constant, what's
the independent effect of X?

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,120
What's the slope for X once you've held
everything else in the model constant?

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,150
That's the idea, and I'm going to kind of
try and illustrate that concept now.

24
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,160
There are many functions of multivariate
analysis.

25
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,680
So, one of them is that it allows you to
control for confounders.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,960
So you can put potential confounders in
the model, so that you

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,380
can try to gauge the independent effect of
the predictors you're interested in.

28
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:52,310
After adjusting for, after controlling for
confounders.

29
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,610
You're going to be able to isolate better.

30
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,165
The effect of the predictor you care
about.

31
00:01:57,165 --> 00:02:02,300
Putting multiple variables in the
regression equation allows you

32
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,080
also to improve your predictions.

33
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,190
So now instead of saying it's our
political bent that predicts whether or

34
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,360
not we like Obama, maybe there are other
variables I

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,060
can come up with that also help improve
that prediction beyond political bent.

36
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,920
Are there other things that predict who's
going to like Obama?

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,730
Another thing that you can do in a
multivariate

38
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,630
analysis is tests for interaction.

39
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,920
I'm actually not going to talk about
interactions in any detail this week.

40
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,410
I'm going to give this a lot of time next
week.

41
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,810
I sort of alluded to interactions in Week
6.

42
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,320
So you may be familiar with the concept.

43
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,420
But it's something that you can easily
test for

44
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,180
in the multivariate regression analysis
context.

45
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,870
Again i'm going to get to that next week.

46
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,356
In this module I'm going to work on the
first two of these.

47
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:53,210
Controlling for confounders and improving
predictions.

48
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,410
So starting with the first one.

49
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,562
How does multivariate analysis how can it
be used to control for confounding?

50
00:02:58,562 --> 00:03:02,640
I'm just going to illustrate this with an
example.

51
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,830
So lets start with the hypothetical data
that I had on vitamin D levels and

52
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,770
cognitive function.

53
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,380
I'm going to use the hypothetical data set
that had the strongest association between

54
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,080
those two things.

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,190
The one that had the slope of 1.5 per 10
nanomoles per liter.

56
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,410
Here's the regression equation.

57
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,650
We already fitted the best fit line here.

58
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,330
This is the simple linear regression
equation.

59
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,790
The intercept was 20, the slope here again
is 1.5.

60
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,050
Of course, I made up these data, so

61
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,970
I get to build anything into the data set
that I want to.

62
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,400
So I built in a confounder here.

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,206
And it makes sense that this particular
variable would actually be

64
00:03:41,206 --> 00:03:41,870
a confounder here.

65
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,660
So, what if age is a confounder here?

66
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,260
So, we, we're seeing a relationship in the
data set between vitamin D levels and

67
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,201
poor cognition.

68
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:52,720
There's [INAUDIBLE] there's real
relationship in these data and

69
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,980
I know there's a real relationship because
I built it in.

70
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,030
But what if that relationship was coming
through confounding with age?

71
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,110
Remember, as you age,

72
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,980
it's definitely true that your cognition,
your cognitive function goes down.

73
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,640
That's true for everyone.

74
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,610
It's also true that as you age, you tend
to have lower vitamin D levels.

75
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,643
So, as you get older your nutrition isn't
as good,

76
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:17,630
that that would affect your vitamin D.

77
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,000
You also might be less likely to do
exercise and

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,820
go outside to do exercise and, and be
outside in general.

79
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,130
All of those things result in older people
having lower vitamin D.

80
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,050
So you can imagine a scenario where you're
seeing a relationship, if you just look at

81
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,010
vitamin D and cognitive function, you
might see a relationship there.

82
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,670
But it could be driven purely by the fact
that older men both have lower

83
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,750
vitamin D and they have poor cognition, so

84
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,190
it might not be that vitamin D is causing
the poorer cognition.

85
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,630
It might just be the fact that vitamin D,
poor cognition, and

86
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,270
age, older age tend to cluster.

87
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,240
Well we can task for this.

88
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,680
We can adjust for age simply by putting
age into our regression model.

89
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,820
Our outcome variable is [INAUDIBLE] still
the cognitive function test,

90
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,480
the DSST score.

91
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,930
We're still going to have an intercept.

92
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,830
But now, in addition to the slope for

93
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,190
vitamin D, we're going to add in a slope
for age.

94
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,960
If I have two slopes,

95
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,121
what I'm actually doing is fitting now not
a line, but I'm fitting a plane.

96
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:24,620
And I can try, it's again, always great to
graph things.

97
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,688
And I'm going to try here to graph this.

98
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:34,600
It gets very hard to graph things from
multivariate regression because you can

99
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,340
kind of graph a plan okay, but anything
beyond a plane I can't really graph.

100
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,280
But for two variables, again we're dealing
with something in three dimensions.

101
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,950
Here's my three dimensional plot, my
attempt to plot this.

102
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,890
Of course, with three dimensional plots it
completely,

103
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,580
what you're seeing completely depends on
the angle that you look at.

104
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,130
But I've tried to choose something that's
illustrative here.

105
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,860
What you're seeing is that vitamin D
levels,

106
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,204
that's your x-axis variable, your
cognitive score.

107
00:05:59,204 --> 00:06:03,510
Is the y axis variable and age in this
plot is the z variable.

108
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,900
That's the one that's kind of going into
your computer screen.

109
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,470
So again, this is supposed to be three
dimensional.

110
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,700
What you can notice, is that when,

111
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,140
in this particular angle, when I'm
focusing on age is in the picture, but

112
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,980
I'm focusing on the relationship between
vitamin D and cognitive function,

113
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,440
it no longer looks like there's much of a
strong relationship there, right?

114
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,025
It kind of looks like a random scatter.

115
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:29,179
Compare that to when I kind of turn this
three-dimensional plot and

116
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:32,050
put age on the x-axis and vitamin D on the
z-axis.

117
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,630
So now vitamin D is kind of going into
your computer screen, so

118
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,590
you can, you can see it less.

119
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,790
And I'm kind of trying to isolate here the
effect of age and cognitive score.

120
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:47,010
Now you can see this strong relationship
as age goes up cognitive score goes down,

121
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,715
so based on the 3 dimensional pictures it
looks like there's a stronger effect for

122
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:52,370
age here then than for vitamin D.

123
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,720
We can actually fit a plane here rather
than a line.

124
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,080
That's what our model is doing.

125
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,925
We're fitting a plane rather than line.

126
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:03,480
Our plane is defined by two slopes.

127
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,246
One slope for vitamin D, and one slope for
age.

128
00:07:06,246 --> 00:07:11,766
And what you're seeing here that, for
example, what you're seeing these

129
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:16,918
kind of vertical diagonal lines, those
are, that's the slope for age.

130
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:22,960
Notice here that there's a slope for age
at every different vitamin D level.

131
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,800
Of course, the slope for age is the same
at any vitamin D level.

132
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,850
So for example, at a vitamin D level of,
you know this is something like 60, here's

133
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,650
the slope for age, here's the relationship
between age and cognitive function.

134
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,950
There's a pretty strong positive
relationship,

135
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,900
as age goes up, cognitive function really
goes up strongly.

136
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,940
Contrast that to the slope for vitamin D.

137
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,450
Those are the more horizontal lines here.

138
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:52,552
So this, these horizontal lines represent,
this is the slope for vitamin D.

139
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:57,500
The relationship between vitamin D and
cognitive function at any given age.

140
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,230
For example if we take the age about 55
right here,

141
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:07,010
there's a particular slope between vitamin
D level and cognitive function.

142
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,880
The slope is constant.

143
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,280
The slope between vitamin D and

144
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,390
cognitive function doesn't depend on the
age, but we've isolated the effect of

145
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,190
age because we're talking about the slope
at any particular age.

146
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,560
And we're assuming that that slope is the
same at different ages.

147
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,640
So we've isolated the effect of vitamin D
in that way.

148
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,280
You can see that the slope for

149
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,266
vitamin D here is almost perfectly flat,
it's almost 0.

150
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:33,550
Suggesting that the relationship between
vitamin D and

151
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,380
cognitive function is basically 0 once we
adjust for, once we account for age.

152
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,320
If we're, if we're talking about a whole
group of just 55 year olds there

153
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,590
doesn't appear to be any relationship left
for vitamin D in cognitive function.

154
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,914
That's the idea here.

155
00:08:48,914 --> 00:08:51,820
We fit this plane and we see the slope for

156
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,690
vitamin D is almost 0 where as the slope
for age is very strong.

157
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,670
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Here's the computer output that

158
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,498
corresponds to the model that that
corresponds to

159
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:06,040
the picture that I just showed.

160
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,230
I just showed you the visual picture of
this and

161
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,930
here's the actual fitted model that I've
run in a computer.

162
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,150
Again, you have to learn to kind of weed
through a computer output like this.

163
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,500
What we're interested in are the parameter
estimates, those are are,

164
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,010
that's our intercept and our betas or
slopes.

165
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,120
That's what the,

166
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,880
the model estimates, as pictured on the,
the graphic on the previous slide.

167
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,070
We're also interested in the p-values that
tell us whether or

168
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,870
not those slopes are statistically
significant or not.

169
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,250
The standard error here and the t value
directly combine with the effect size to

170
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,080
give us the p-value, so I most care here
about the actual size of the effect,

171
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,710
the parameter, and the p-value.

172
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,410
The standard error,

173
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,420
and the t value are really just useful for
just getting me to the p-value.

174
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,990
So I, I'm, going to probably report in my
paper,

175
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,550
if I were to write a paper about this,
that the betas, and the p-values.

176
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,380
Here's our final model.

177
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,990
Our outcome variables DSST score, our
intercept is 53, the slope for

178
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:06,080
age is negative 0.46, the slope for
Vitamin d is positive 0.039.

179
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,795
Remember that the slope for Vitamin D when
we didn't put age in the model,

180
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:13,530
in the simple linear regression was 1.5.

181
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:18,640
So we've now gone all the way from 1.5 per
10 nanomoles per liter, which was a pretty

182
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,040
big effect, a modest effect, down to 0.039
which is essentially zero.

183
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,465
This is highly non-significant.

184
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:26,380
Our p-value is 0.9.

185
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,930
There's no evidence here that this is
different than zero.

186
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,790
And we are, the magnitude of our effect of
the slope is very close to zero.

187
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,850
On the other hand, for age, the slope for
age is negative 0.46.

188
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,280
It's highly statistically significant.

189
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,500
This is indicating that every one year
increase in

190
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,500
age is correlated with a half point
decrease in the DSST score.

191
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,393
That's a pretty steep decline.

192
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:54,260
Here again is written out the equation of
the best fit plane.

193
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,845
The best fit plane here is again,

194
00:10:56,845 --> 00:11:01,000
53 plus the intercept plus 0.039 times the
vitamin D.

195
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,980
And 10 nanomoles per liter minus 0.46
times age in years.

196
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,600
That's our final equation.

197
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,372
And you can see, again, that there isn't
much effect left for vitamin D.

198
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:16,795
All, essentially all of the relationship
we were seeing between vitamin D and

199
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:21,689
DSST score can be explained by age, due to
confounding by age.

200
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:26,102
We can say there's no independent effect
of vitamin D after accounting for age.

201
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,346
There's nothing left over in this case.

202
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:31,542
Now a lot of times confounding is not
going to be this strong.

203
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:35,962
This is a made up example, so I built in
essentially complete confounding by age.

204
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,860
Real examples are going to be a little bit
more subtle.

205
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,760
The the effect may not completely
disappear once you

206
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,800
control for compounding.

207
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,220
It might just be attenuated, but in this
case we're basically down to a sub of 0.

208
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,970
All of the effect that we observed between
vitamin D and

209
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:57,665
cognitive function was completely due to
compounding by age and this example.

210
00:11:57,665 --> 00:12:01,900
The evidence of confounding is in the beta
coefficient.

211
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,010
So the way that you test for confounding
is, you calculate the unadjusted beta,

212
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,180
which, here, was 1.5 per 10 nanomoles per
liter.

213
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,460
Then, you calculate the adjusted beta,
adjusted for

214
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,900
the, for the potential confounders.

215
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,130
In this case, age.

216
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,770
When we do that adjustment here, it goes
down.

217
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,113
Our beta goes down to almost 0.039 per 10
nanomoles.

218
00:12:20,113 --> 00:12:21,170
Moles per liter.

219
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,370
The evidence of confounding is in the
difference between the unadjusted and

220
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,585
the adjusted beta.

221
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:28,120
If there is the rule of [INAUDIBLE] thumb
that people use is,

222
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,830
if there is more than a 10% change from
the unadjusted to the adjusted beta,

223
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,260
then that 10% change could be an increase
as well as a decrease.

224
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,570
It doesn't always have to be an
attenuation, although that's more common.

225
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,130
If there's more than a 10% change we
usually would call that confounding.

226
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:50,830
Notice in this case there's a 97.4% change
from the unadjusted to age adjusted beta.

227
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,805
So there's you know the almost all of the
effect for

228
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:56,791
vitamin D was due to confounding by age.

229
00:12:56,791 --> 00:13:00,350
Again the rule of thumb that you can use,
is a rule of thumb so

230
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,140
it's not a perfect rule.

231
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,580
But just kind of as a guide, if that beta
changes by more than 10% when you

232
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,070
put the confounder in the model, then you
would consider it a confounder.

233
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,860
And often it means you might want to
consider keeping it in

234
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,590
your model to account for that confounder
to adjust for.

235
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:19,240
Notice that I'm not judging confounders by
their effect on p-values.

236
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,370
So you want to look at the betas to judge
whether or not something's a confounder.

237
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,200
You don't want to look at the p-values.

238
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,730
You might be tempted in this particular
example to say, oh well, vitamin D had

239
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,850
a significant relationship with cognitive
function before I put agent to the model.

240
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,200
When I put agent to the model, that
significant effect disappeared.

241
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,450
Therefore, I've got a confounder.

242
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,175
But don't use the P value like that
because sometimes you'll have

243
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:43,920
confounders that aren't going to be strong
enough to

244
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,170
change the p-value from something
significant to something non-significant.

245
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:53,230
There's lots of things that, as we've
talked about, impact the p-value

246
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,000
beyond effect size as well, so you really
want to judge confounding simple by

247
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,820
looking at how it changes the effect size,
how it changes the slope.

248
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,540
So ignore what it does to the p-values.

249
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,750
In this case it happens to take the
p-value from significant to

250
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,379
non significant, but that won't always be
the case.
