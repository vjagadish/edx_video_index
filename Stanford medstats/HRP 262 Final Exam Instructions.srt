[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,850
Since we're not having an official class
meeting after the,

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,500
final exam is slated to be released, I
thought it would be worth me taping just

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,080
a short video to say a few words about the
final exam.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,660
So, the data for the final exam come from
a BMJ Open paper.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,070
The authors were kind enough to share
their data with us.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,450
The authors had run a cluster randomized
trial.

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,040
So, they had randomly assigned six
pregnancy clinics.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,264
They assigned three of them to be the
intervention clinics and

10
00:00:36,264 --> 00:00:38,320
three to be the control clinics.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,260
And women were enrolled from within those
clinics.

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,286
Women rolled into the, enrolled into the
intervention clinics received some

13
00:00:46,286 --> 00:00:49,519
lifestyle counseling about diet and
exercise to help them lose

14
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:53,330
their pregnancy weight faster after the
birth of their babies.

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,150
The control clinics didn't receive
anything.

16
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:02,330
And the primary outcome of this trial was
the mother's weight loss postpartum.

17
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,140
Those data are in a different paper and
that's not the focus of this analysis.

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,360
So, this paper is actually looking at a
secondary outcome.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,500
The authors went back and collected data
about the weight gain of the infants and

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,740
toddlers over time.

21
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,250
And their thought was that if the mothers
received some training about

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,850
eating better, that that somehow might rub
off on their children and

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,620
that the children might have a slower
trajectory of weight gain over time,

24
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,840
which would be valuable for preventing
things like childhood obesity.

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
So, they were able to collect, the
original trial had 89 women in it.

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,410
They were able to go back and collect this
weight gain data on the infants for

27
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,920
64 out of the original 89 infants.

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,180
And the infants had their weights measured
about ten times during their

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,200
first year of life.

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,110
Infants go in frequently to the doctor to
be checked.

31
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,090
And then had their weights measured and

32
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,680
heights measured at their second, third
and fourth birthdays.

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,860
The authors provided me the data.

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,340
Here's the final exam shown here.

35
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,750
The authors provided me the data in the
long form the variables also had Italian

36
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,223
names which I went through and changed for
you into something English, but

37
00:02:09,223 --> 00:02:13,080
the data dictionary is there for available
in the long form of the data.

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,210
In that Excel file, there's a tab that
says labels and

39
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,830
values, you can click on that, you'll see
the full data dictionary in English.

40
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,270
I also turned the data into the broad form
just in case there are some analyses that

41
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,380
are easier to do with the broad form and
you want the broad form in the data.

42
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,780
For the exam I'm asking you to look at
three outcomes,

43
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,790
the two outcomes that the authors look for
in their paper, the weight for

44
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,810
length z scores which was measured at
every time point.

45
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,850
The BMI z score, which is only available
after the infants turn two

46
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:45,370
because the standardization to calculate
those z scores is only available.

47
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,080
It's based on population norms and

48
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,040
it's only available for infants who are
older than two.

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,930
So there's most of the infants only have
two or three values for that BMI z score.

50
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,800
Those are the two outcomes that the
authors looked at in the paper.

51
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,430
I am additionally asking you to look at
the absolute value of

52
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,250
weight in kilograms to give you a third
variable that isn't in the paper, for

53
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,960
you to grapple with for your final exam.

54
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,360
I'm leading you through a series of
questions,

55
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,760
there's a couple of questions that ask you
to think about missing data.

56
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,540
And then I'm leading you through a series
of plots that you need to do and

57
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,730
it's going to be really important to
understand these data.

58
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,650
You really need to do a lot of plotting.

59
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,530
The first plot you're going to have to do
is just to reproduce figure two

60
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,450
which you see here, these growth
trajectories.

61
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,660
I just let you know that you do not have
to make all of

62
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,460
the formatting identical to what is in the
paper here.

63
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,570
It should look professional and the
trajectory should look the same but

64
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,820
you don't have to match exactly the
legends and things.

65
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,520
I'm leading you through a series of other
graphics that will help you to

66
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,100
understand the data.

67
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,033
In question seven here, I'm then asking
you to basically recreate

68
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:51,460
the statistical models that the author's
themselves ran in their paper.

69
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,880
And there's a nice description if

70
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,390
you scroll down into the statistical
methods section.

71
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,470
It starts mixed effects linear regression
models.

72
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,069
It tells you exactly what those what, what
they put in those models, and

73
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:05,786
you're welcome to run very similar models,
to what the authors ran here,

74
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:08,190
of course, you want to think about it.

75
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,670
Think carefully about it.

76
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:14,615
I want to just point out that there is a
layer of complexity here that we

77
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:18,330
haven't dealt with in the homeworks so far
for this class.

78
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,700
And, what we have here, is we have two
sources of clustering.

79
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,740
So we have been dealing with observations
that are clustered within

80
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,700
an individual because we have repeated
measures within the same individual.

81
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,380
We've dealt with that so far and I told
you how to deal with that.

82
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,110
There's an additional source of
correlation here, however, because this is

83
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,460
a cluster randomized trial and so that
means that we may have some correlation

84
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,680
among the women within a given clinic and
so we at least have to consider that.

85
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,330
We at least have to try to build that into
our models to

86
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,770
test whether there's any correlation there
that we need to worry about.

87
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:53,129
The nice thing is that if you use a random
effects model,

88
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:56,165
you can actually have it in the code two
random line,

89
00:04:56,165 --> 00:05:00,236
more than one line where you can ask for
not only randomized effects for

90
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:05,110
subjects, so subject specific intercept
and subject specific slopes.

91
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,320
But you can also ask for clinic specific
intercepts and

92
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,700
clinic specific slopes and I've given you
the code under question seven here that

93
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,500
you would need in order to be able to do
this kind of model.

94
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,360
So, that should be enough to set you up to
do those models.

95
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,530
It may turn out that the random effects
for

96
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,590
clinic may not add much to the model fit.

97
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,680
It may be that there isn't a lot of
correlation within class, within clinic.

98
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,720
And if that's the case, you know then
it'll be up to you whether or

99
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,740
not you keep those in the model.

100
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,392
But we at least need to think about the
effect of clinic here,

101
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:35,660
because it is a cluster randomized trial.

102
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,700
So, I think I've given you enough
instruction there, to be able to do that.

103
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,650
I'm asking you to recreate the,

104
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,980
basically, the analyses that are presented
in table two.

105
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,390
So, you're going to make something similar
to what you see here in table two.

106
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,348
I'll point out that, even if you run the
exact same models,

107
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:54,176
you think you're running the exact same
models as what the authors describe in

108
00:05:54,176 --> 00:05:57,826
their paper you may get slightly, slightly
different estimates.

109
00:05:57,826 --> 00:05:59,716
They used a different program than SAS and

110
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:03,172
there may be slightly different things
about how we're modeling degrees of

111
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:07,820
freedom so, I didn't get identical values
to what's in the table so don't expect to.

112
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,310
I'm also asking you to additionally, get
the values to build a model for

113
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,664
weight in kilograms.

114
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,930
Of course that's so that I can make sure
that you're actually building these models

115
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,270
correctly and not just copying the values
that are presented in the table here.

116
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,710
And so that's just basically the final
exam.

117
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,650
I'm leaving you through a series of
questions.

118
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,432
There's probably going to be a lot more
you do to look at these data than

119
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:33,620
than our just, then just the questions I'm
asking you on the final exam.

120
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,190
I'll point out that there is a, an age
cube.

121
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,910
There's a cubic term in the weight for
length z score model.

122
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,970
To get that it's very similar to dealing
with a quadratic instead of doing age

123
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:49,140
star age, you would do age star age star
age and that would give you in cubic term.

124
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,130
That just means that the weight growth
trajectories over

125
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,592
time are cubic rather than quadratic.

126
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:58,478
And as you might expect the growth
trajectories as you can see in the picture

127
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,132
from figure two, the growth trajectories
don't look perfectly linear or

128
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:04,940
quadratic over time there's actually a
cubic there.

129
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,920
So hopefully that's enough to get you
started and good luck with the exam.

130
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,180
I will be providing a solutions video at,
after you've

131
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,360
finished the exam that will again walk you
through the steps of a real data analysis.
