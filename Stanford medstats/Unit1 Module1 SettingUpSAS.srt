1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,402
Welcome back, today we're going to talk
about setting up SAS.

2
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:05,604
In a few minutes time,

3
00:00:05,604 --> 00:00:08,909
Ram is going to run through how to set up
the SAS remote server.

4
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,233
But first, there are a few things I think
we need to cover.

5
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:16,039
I want to talk about the options for those
who do not want to use the remote server.

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,344
Sometimes the server can be a little bit
slow,

7
00:00:18,344 --> 00:00:22,733
especially during the biostat labs and the
night before homework assignments are due.

8
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,311
While many students in the MS epidemiology
and

9
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:26,750
clinical research track did not have
problems with the remote server.

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,860
You may choose to buy your own copy of SAS
enterprise guide.

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,480
For those of you with PCs you can purchase
SAS enterprise guide from

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,283
Stanford University for $50.

13
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:39,983
There will be a separate PowerPoint
presentation for

14
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:42,390
those of you who want to setup your own
version.

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,450
For those of you with a Mac, things get a
little more complicated,

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,920
SAS only runs on Windows, so we strongly
suggest that you use the server.

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,780
If you really, really want your own copy
of SAS on your Mac, please come talk to

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,200
us during the first class lecture and we
will talk you out of it.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,860
Enjoy the lecture.

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,830
>> Now I will show you how to

21
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,960
set up access to the SAS server on your
own computer.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,099
The first step is to contact us to get
authorized for server access.

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,580
Once we authorize you, you need to set up
the VPN connection.

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,980
If you have Windows, follow this link.

25
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,150
If you have Mac, follow this link.

26
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,020
That should have all the instructions you
need for setting up a VPN connection.

27
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,630
Once you have the VPN set up, you need to
connect to the VPN.

28
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,710
If you have Windows, log into the Cisco
client that you just set up.

29
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,400
If you have a Mac, log in through the
network settings on your own computer;

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,640
this is located under system preferences.

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,577
Once you connect to the VPN, go to
sunac.standford.edu and log in.

32
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:45,021
Now you need to set up the server
connection, following this link and

33
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,330
scroll down to step 2, option 2.

34
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,800
Specify if you have Windows or Mac, and
click Launch RDP Desktop.

35
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,270
This'll download a file that'll let you
connect to the server.

36
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,500
Now you're all set up to connect to the
server.

37
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,460
Whenever you want to connect to the
server, you need to do three things.

38
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,960
First you need to connect to the VPN.

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,689
If you have Windows, use the Cisco client
to connect to su-vpn.Stanford.edu.

40
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:14,130
If you have Mac, use the network settings
to connect to the Stanford VPN you set

41
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,420
up and enter your password.

42
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,771
The next step is to go to
sunac.Stanford.edu and log in.

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,390
And finally watch the RDP desktop profile
that you downloaded, and

44
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,147
enter in your credentials.

45
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,820
Make sure to type win\ before your
username, once you log in, you'll be

46
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,860
connected to the remote server and you'll
be able to run SAS Enterprise Guide.

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,160
Whenever you're finished using the server,
please make sure to log off.

48
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,910
If you stay logged in for

49
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,550
too long, you'll hog the server resources
and you might lose unsaved information.
