1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:06,970
Let's go back to some data I presented
earlier about the prevalence of depression

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,940
and artery blockage in a large cohort of
elderly men and women in Rotterdam.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,180
We can use these data to calculate some
odds ratios.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,960
But before we do the odds ratio, I'm first
going to calculate for you,

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,670
the risk ratio.

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,680
This study had divided people into 3
levels of

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,250
coronary calcification low medium and
high.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,370
It also looked at the prevalence of
depressive disorders within each of those

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,290
groups so you can see that as you win up
in the corner in calcification levels that

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,780
your going up slightly in the prevalence
of depressive disorders.

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,460
To calculate the risk ratios here we have
to pick 1 of the groups to be

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,420
the reference group.

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,180
So I'm going to pick the, the lowest
coronary calcification group that

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,230
also has the lowest prevalence of
depressive disorders.

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,740
So it sort of makes sense to make that the
reference group.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,860
To calculate the risk ratio for the median
group compared to the low group then I'm

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,830
going to divide the 2.3% by the .9% I get
a risk ratio 2.56 to

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,290
calculate a risk ratio for the high group
compared to the reference group I'm

19
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,980
going to divide the 3 by the .9 and get a
risk ratio of 3.33.

20
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,900
How do I interpret these that 2.56 you
would interpret that those with moderate

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,459
blockage in the median group of coronary
calcification have a 156% increased

22
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:20,310
prevalence of depressive disorder compared
to those with the least blockage.

23
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,800
The 3.33 would, you would interpret that
as those with the most severe

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,780
blockage have a 233% increase in the
prevalence of depressive disorder,

25
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,780
compared with those with the least
blockage.

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,590
Okay, so those are the risk ratios, and

27
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,090
you might think it would be just natural
to report the risk ratios here.

28
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,370
I mean this is a cross sectional study,
it's not a case control study.

29
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,000
The, the risk ratios are valid.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,900
Why would you report anything else?

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,530
However, if you look at the paper from the
study,

32
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,920
you'll notice that when it came to
reporting measures of relative risk,

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,590
the authors actually reported odds ratios
not risk ratios.

34
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,970
So what's going on here is that the
authors wanted to adjust for confounders.

35
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,580
So they used logistic regression.

36
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,220
And as I said, logistic regression gives
you odds ratios.

37
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,320
And if you read very carefully in the
little footnote here,

38
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,760
you'll notice it says.

39
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,020
Odds ratios were calculated with logistic
regression.

40
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,130
And they even tell you all the confounders
they adjusted for.

41
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,966
This was obviously an observational study.

42
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:18,670
There are lots of potential confounders
that we want to adjust for.

43
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,370
So they adjusted for

44
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,160
things like age, sex, cholesterol,
cognitive score lots of things.

45
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,260
So that's why they're reporting odds ratio
because they

46
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,170
did this multivaried adjustment.

47
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,210
Logistic regression, logistic regression
gives you odds ratios.

48
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,620
I'm now going to walk you through how to
calculate odds ratio's.

49
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,240
Using a, of course, the unadjusted
percentages.

50
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,820
We're going to use the unadjusted numbers
so

51
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,650
we're going to get slightly different oz
ratios then the authors got when they

52
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,600
used this multivariated adjustment
because, of course,

53
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,794
when things are adjusted they're going to
there going to shift slightly.

54
00:02:50,794 --> 00:02:55,430
But we're going to get, actually you'll
see we get pretty similar numbers.

55
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,060
The first step, before we can calculate an
odds ratio,

56
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,630
we have to calculate an odds for each
group.

57
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,080
So for the low coronary calcification,
calcification group.

58
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,100
The, the risk, the prevalence of
depressive symptoms was .9%.

59
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,325
Therefore, the odds is the, the risk.

60
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,450
The percentage.

61
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,390
Divided by the, the risk of having
depressive symptoms divided by the risk of

62
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,520
not having depressive symptom.

63
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,140
So the risk of having depressive symptoms
is 0.9%,

64
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,660
the risk of not having it therefore was 1
minus 0.9% or 99.1%.

65
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,420
So that's the odds of depressive symptoms
for that group.

66
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,864
For the medium coronary calcification
group we would divide the risk,

67
00:03:35,864 --> 00:03:39,530
2.3% By 1 minus that, 97.7 percent.

68
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,530
That's the odds for the medium group.

69
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,860
The odds for the high, coronary
calcification,

70
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,130
the severe blockage group, is 3 divided by
1 minus 3 percent, which is 97 percent.

71
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,470
So those are how to calculate the odds.

72
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,200
The odds ratio is then calculated by
making a ratio of odds.

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,010
And notice, there's lots of fractions
running around here.

74
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,985
So it's, gotta keep track of everything.

75
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:01,200
[INAUDIBLE].
We're now going to make the odds ratio by

76
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,160
taking the odds in each group and dividing
by the odds in the reference group.

77
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,660
I'm again going to make the reference
group that zero to 100,

78
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,000
that low coronary calcification group.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,810
So to calculate the odds of depressive the
odds ratio.

80
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,310
For depressive systems.

81
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,880
In the medium group compared with the
reference group.

82
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:29,020
I would take the odds in that group, which
was 2.3 percent divided by 97.7 percent.

83
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,750
That's the odds for the medium group.

84
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,950
I'm going to divide it by the odds for

85
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:37,750
the reference group, which was .9 percent
divided by 99.1 percent.

86
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,710
When I calculate that out, I get a value
of 2.59, again, slightly different than we

87
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,296
got for the, that the author got for the
adjusted odds ratio but pretty close.

88
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:53,239
For the high group, the odds ratio would
be the odd

89
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:58,800
in the high coronary calcification group,
that's 3% divided by 97%,

90
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,994
divided by the odd in the reference group,
which again, 0.9% divided by 99.1%.

91
00:05:03,994 --> 00:05:08,150
'Cuz, see, you're dividing, a fraction by
a fraction.

92
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,870
So, a lot of fractions going on here.

93
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,620
So when you actually calculate that out,
you get a value of 3.41.

94
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,930
So the odds ratio of 2.59 would be incr-,
interpreted as 159%

95
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,186
increase in the odds, not the risk, the
odds of depressive disorder for the 3.41.

96
00:05:25,186 --> 00:05:30,280
That's interpreted as a 241% increase in
the odds of depressive disorder.

97
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,720
And notice that it's an increase in odds
and not an increase in risk and

98
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,400
that distinction is actually not important
if you have rare outcomes.

99
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,870
But, as we're going to see in the next
module, that distinction of

100
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,950
odds here is very important when you have
common outcomes because the odds ratio is

101
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,339
going to be very different than the risk
ratio in those cases.

102
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,470
So again, notice we have, in this case, we
have a rare outcome.

103
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,720
Depressive disorder was very rare here.

104
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
So the odds ratio and the risk ratio.

105
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,930
The unadjusted odds ratio, and the
unadjusted risk ratio are very similar.

106
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,670
We calculated the unadjusted risk ratio to
be 2.56 earlier.

107
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,730
For the odds ratio, it was 2.59.

108
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,650
They're almost the same.

109
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,440
For the high group, the more severe
coronary blockage.

110
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,375
It was 3.33 was the risk ratio.

111
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,350
3.41 was the odds ratio.

112
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,348
Notice, the odds ratio is always bigger.

113
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:21,080
But the difference here is so small, that
when you have a rare event.

114
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,760
It turns out that you can interpret the
odds ratio as you would a risk ratio.

115
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,320
And that's usually the case when we're
talking about a case control study.

116
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,960
Because we usually do case control studies
because of the outcome we're

117
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,800
interested in is rare.

118
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,330
However, when the outcome is common,

119
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,690
as is often the case in cross-sectional
studies or cohort studies,

120
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,200
the odds ratio and the risk ratio are not
similar; they can be extremely different.

121
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,220
And if you interpret the odds ratios
wrong,

122
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,150
that can be very misleading, as we're
going to see in the next module.

123
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,130
I just want to reiterate.

124
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,150
You might be wondering, why the heck do we
ever calculate this confusing odds ratio.

125
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,130
So again, there's two reasons.

126
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,550
You need the odds ratio because, it's the
only valid measure of relative risk for

127
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,060
a case-control study.

128
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,560
And because sometimes authors want to run
logistic regression.

129
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,180
And logistic regression gives you out odds
ratios and so that's what end up,

130
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,240
people end up reporting.

131
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,380
So that's the two main reasons we're going
to end up seeing odds ratios.

132
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,120
There's something wrong within odds ratio,
is simply that you have to be very

133
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,590
careful in your interpretation so that you
don't end up misleading your reader.

134
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,920
Finally, I want to challenge you to
practice calculating an odds

135
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,840
ratio on the Vioxx data.

136
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,480
So, take the data you see on the screen
here.

137
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,380
In a moment I'm going to ask you to pause
the video.

138
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,790
Try to calculate the odds ratio on your
own, and then restart the video and

139
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,742
I'll walk you through the calculation of
the odds ratio.

140
00:07:38,742 --> 00:07:45,080
Show here.

141
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,350
Alright, so hopefully you had no trouble
calculating the odds ratio here.

142
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,340
So to calculate the odds ratio, we're
going to calculate the odds for

143
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,610
the Vioxx group, that's going to be the
numerator, that's 0.42%.

144
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,290
And the, the cha, that's the chance of
getting a heart attack,

145
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,300
the chance of not getting a heart attack
is therefore 1 minus that.

146
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,434
Which is 99.58%.

147
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:07,600
That's the numerator.

148
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:15,090
In the denominator, the odds for the
Naproxen group is 0.1% divided by 99.9%.

149
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,050
When you calculate that all out, you get
an odds ratio of 4.21.

150
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:26,880
Now remember, that our rate ratio and our
risk ratio here Or 4.2.

151
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,450
And so, the odds ratio is almost identical
here to the risk ratio.

152
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,710
Well, why is that the case?

153
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,715
Because the heart attacks here was such a
right rare event.

154
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,340
By which I mean a very rare event.

155
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,210
When you have rare events again, odds
ratios and risk ratios are similar.

156
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,693
And you can see that.
