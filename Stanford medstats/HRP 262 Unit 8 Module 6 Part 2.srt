1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,276
So finally I thought it would be useful to
actually look at some real data,

2
00:00:03,276 --> 00:00:04,480
rather than some made up data.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,942
So going back to the data set I have on
runners, the larger data set.

4
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:11,454
I measured bone mineral density on those
runners at three time points.

5
00:00:11,454 --> 00:00:13,160
And we also measured their weight.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,998
And so for example, if you wanted to know
whether or

7
00:00:15,998 --> 00:00:20,790
not increases in weight, correlated with
increases in bone mineral density.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,226
You might run a generalized estimating
equation.

9
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:27,286
And my outcome here would be bone marrow
density, measured at three time points.

10
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:30,275
So you can kind of think of it again as a
vector of bone marrow

11
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:31,599
density measurements.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,524
And, so I'm writing a GEE model.

13
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:37,338
And I'll have time in the model.

14
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:39,720
And I'll also have this vector of weights.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,158
If I enter weight in as a time changing
predictor,

16
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:46,458
I've got the centralist vector of weights.

17
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,410
And I've got a single beta for weight.

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,820
When I went ahead and ran that model with
these data, I'll show you what I get.

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,200
So you'll see that my weight was in
pounds.

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,450
I get a highly significant coefficient for
weight.

21
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,380
So weight across time does seem to be
correlated to bone mineral density.

22
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,410
I also get a significant effect for time,

23
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,440
saying that as we know in these women the
bone density was going up over time.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,823
But how do I interpret this beta
coefficient for weight here?

25
00:01:15,823 --> 00:01:17,154
It's highly significant.

26
00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:20,738
But it could be that I'm getting a
significant coefficient here,

27
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:24,520
because people who are heavier have
stronger skeletons.

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,355
Or, it could be that women who increase
their weight also increase their bone

29
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,360
mineral density.

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,680
Or it could be some combination of both of
those.

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,000
How am I going to tease that out?

32
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,720
So, one way to do it is just graphically.

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,024
And so, what I did here is I went ahead,
and

34
00:01:39,024 --> 00:01:42,177
I graphed the cross sectional relationship
at base line.

35
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:44,230
Between weight and spine bone density.

36
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,250
To look for between subjects effects.

37
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,560
And we have, clearly, very strong between
subjects effects here at baseline.

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,270
The higher your weight was at baseline,

39
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,650
the higher your spine bone density tended
to be.

40
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,510
So strong between-subjects effects for
sure.

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,134
To look for within-subjects effects,

42
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:04,843
I then calculated the change in spine bone
density from time period one to two.

43
00:02:04,843 --> 00:02:06,956
And from time period two to three.

44
00:02:06,956 --> 00:02:12,030
And I graphed that against the change in
weight for those same time periods.

45
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,660
So every woman will have two dots on here
representing her two

46
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,660
different time periods.

47
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,782
And you can see that there are some
within-subjects effect here, but

48
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:22,350
they're much, much weaker.

49
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,683
There's a lot of women who didn't change
much in their weight.

50
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:28,810
So we get this kind of, line of women
around zero.

51
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,449
If you superimpose a regression line here,
it certainly does look positive.

52
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:36,402
But be careful because your eye is sort of
being drawn by a few people who happen to

53
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:38,003
have very large weight gains.

54
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:40,098
And also happen to gain spine bone
density.

55
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:44,190
So if you deleted these two subjects over
here, it wouldn't be a very strong effect.

56
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,902
So, probably we have, very strong between
subjects effects here,

57
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:51,930
that are driving that significant beta co
efficient for weight.

58
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,693
We probably have some weak within subjects
effects that are also contributing, but

59
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:56,760
that are much weaker.
