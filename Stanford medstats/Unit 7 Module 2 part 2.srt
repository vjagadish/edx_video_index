1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,930
There are other ways to there's
modifications of the Bonferroni called

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,401
the Holm and Hochberg which are a little
bit less conservative.

3
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:09,703
There are other procedures for

4
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:14,061
adjusting the p values to reflect the
number of multiple tabs.

5
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:17,450
Those are called Tukey HFA and again
usually you can just ask

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,540
the computer to apply those various
corrections if you want to go in And

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,580
figure out exactly where the differences
lie after doing a global ANOVA test.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,787
Now I'm going to say a little bit about
repeated-measures ANOVA.

9
00:00:29,787 --> 00:00:35,490
You use repeated-measures ANOVA when
you've got either more than two correlated

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:41,040
groups or you've got you're following
people over more than two time points.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,250
So there's correlation here.

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,760
Here's an example of a study that used
repeated-measures ANOVA.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,230
To analyze the data.

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,710
this was looking at a placebo pill versus
a particular treatment for depression.

15
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,910
The outcome here is the depression on a
certain scale.

16
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:03,630
They're following the two groups, these
are two independent groups over time.

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,960
And they want to know did the placebo
group go down less over time than

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,610
the treatment group.

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,320
It does look like there's a placebo effect
here.

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,680
Both groups have an initial improvement in
depression but

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,245
only the active treatment group keeps
going down in depression scores.

22
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:21,410
The p-value here of 0.0002 that you see.

23
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,090
Comes from a repeated-measures ANOVA.

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,151
I'm not going to go much into the details
of how the repeated-measures ANOVA

25
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:31,310
works, but that would be the appropriate
statistical test when you're following

26
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,810
people over time like this.

27
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,000
We have multiple time points, so a paired
t-test will not suffice.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,030
We need instead repeated-measures ANOVA.

29
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,130
So how did I figure out that I needed a
repeated-measures ANOVA?

30
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,070
The statistical quest,

31
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,270
question here is do the subjects in the
treatment group have greater reductions in

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,860
the depression scores over time than those
in the control group.

33
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,610
My outcome variable is depression score.

34
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,090
That is a continuous variable, and it is a
normally distributed variable, or,

35
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,600
my sample size here is large enough that
it doesn't matter.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,720
Are the observations correlated?

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,740
Yes, I have multiple measurements, many,
many measurements on each person, so

38
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,900
I have correlated observations.

39
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,470
I have more than 2 time points.

40
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,360
So a paired t-test will not suffice.

41
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,850
I'm going to have to use a repeated
measures ANOVA.

42
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,480
I also have multiple groups here.

43
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,420
Which, paired t-test only is going to work
on one group over time.

44
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,220
So I need to use repeated measures ANOVA.

45
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,660
Because I have multiple groups and more
than 2 time points.

46
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,000
Again, I'm not going to go into much
detail about the repeated measures ANOVA.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,070
I'm just going to tell you a little bit
about it, and how it works.

48
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,940
And when it's used.

49
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,220
Again, if we have more than two time
periods,

50
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,270
paired t-test is not going to suffice.

51
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,590
Now you could say, well why don't I just
do multiple paired t-tests?

52
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,920
Well, I could compare time one to
baseline.

53
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,450
I could compare time two to baseline.

54
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,640
I could compare time three to baseline.

55
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,880
I could use a paired t-test for each of
those comparisons, but again.

56
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,880
The problem is that's going to increase
you type one error,

57
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,430
your chances of a false positive.

58
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,280
So we don't like to do a whole bunch of
paired ttests.

59
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,232
We'd rather put everything together in one
global test which is

60
00:03:00,232 --> 00:03:04,080
repeated-measures ANOVA.

61
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,440
And it answers the following questions.

62
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,680
You get a couple of things out of
repeated-measures ANOVA.

63
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,650
So if you've got say two groups or

64
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,000
more than two groups that you're comparing
over multiple- Time points.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,440
It can answer the following question.

66
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,310
First of all, it can answer just whether
or

67
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,730
not there are significant differences
across time periods.

68
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,160
Does your outcome change at all across
time periods?

69
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,600
So, that's the time factor in
repeated-measures ANOVA.

70
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,370
You can also ask whether or not there were
any significant differences between your

71
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,765
groups, if you've got multiple groups
you're comparing over time.

72
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:38,900
[UNKNOWN] you can ask whether or not there
are significant differences in

73
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,790
the changes over time between those
groups.

74
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,800
So you have what is called a time effect
and group effect in a group by time effect

75
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,400
and usually what we care about like in
that depression example I've just showed

76
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,710
you, we care about the group by time
effect, we cared whether or not there were

77
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,860
differences in the changes in depression
over time between Between the groups.

78
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,650
And repeated measures ANOVA can answer
that question for you.

79
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,000
It's very good for longitudinal data.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,960
So to ask,

81
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,675
is there any change at all over time in
any of the groups, that's the time factor.

82
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:10,550
If you want to ask if there's any
differences in

83
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,840
the groups at any time points.

84
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,050
That's what we call the group factor.

85
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,690
But the one we really care about.

86
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,530
Is whether or not the two groups differ in
their responses over time,

87
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:22,490
that's what we call in repeated-measure
ANOVA, the group by time factor.

88
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,870
I'm just going to show you a couple of
different examples of some mock data to

89
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,670
give you a sense of what you get out of
repeated-measures ANOVA.

90
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,570
So these are all examples where I've got
two groups and

91
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,640
I'm following them over multiple time
points, call them group A and group B.

92
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,170
So you can just look at this graphic, and

93
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,390
what you see in this graph, this is mock
made up data.

94
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,100
But group A seems to be going down at a
faster rate, and

95
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,750
this is, let's say this is depression
score.

96
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,380
Group A which is in black there seems to
be going down at

97
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,920
a faster rate than group B.

98
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,830
Group B is actually pretty steady.

99
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,080
It doesn't change too much.

100
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,280
It's pretty stable over time.

101
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,510
So it looks like [INAUDIBLE].

102
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,030
The, the time factor.

103
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,420
For this repeated measured number, we're
going to get a time factor.

104
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,901
And that time factor is statistically
signifigant.

105
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:07,019
Because, overall.

106
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:08,680
If you just ignore group.

107
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,270
Overall, there does some to be some change
over time.

108
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,869
Overall, there seems to be, on average.

109
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:14,430
There seems to be some decrease in time.

110
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,190
The group by time factor is significant
here as well because the two

111
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,450
groups definitely differ in what happens
over time.

112
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,340
One group goes down in depression the
other is stable.

113
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,188
The group factor is not significant here,
we usually care least about

114
00:05:27,188 --> 00:05:31,210
the group factor, but overall if you kind
of just average the depression across all

115
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,790
the time points in group A versus group B
that was about the same Same,

116
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,910
because group A starts a little higher,
but ends a little bit lower,

117
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,390
so the group factor here will not come out
to be significant.

118
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:44,310
Here's a picture where time is not
significant.

119
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,200
Nobody is changing over time, everybody is
stable.

120
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,840
Time is not significant.

121
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,650
Group by time is also not significant.

122
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,270
Both of those lines are essentially pretty
parallel.

123
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,580
The changes over time are the same for
both of them.

124
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,020
However, the group factor here would be
significant,

125
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,180
because all time points [INAUDIBLE].

126
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,430
One final example.

127
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,990
Here's an example.

128
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,055
Where time would be significant, every
bodies going down over time.

129
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:11,305
Group is not significant because the 2
groups on average seem about the same.

130
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:16,110
And group by time does also, does not come
out to be significant because both groups,

131
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,290
those lines aren't perfectly parallel but
both groups are going down.

132
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,850
Group A is going down slightly faster than
Group B but

133
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,450
not enough to achieve a statistically
significantly difference.

134
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,390
The slopes, there.

135
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,310
So that's the basics of repeated measures
ANOVA, there's a lot more to

136
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,530
repeated measures ANOVA, but that will
just give you a flavor for that technique,

137
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:43,216
that's out there for these kinds of
longitudinal studies.
