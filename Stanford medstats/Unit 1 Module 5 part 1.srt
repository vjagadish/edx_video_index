1
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,810
In this next module, I'm going to tell you
about the statistics that we use to

2
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,785
describe the variability of data.

3
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:18,570
So there's a number of different
statistics that we can use to

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,550
measure variability.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,870
So the simplest is just look at the range.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,750
That tells you about the spread of the
data.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,560
The most common one that we use is
something called the standard deviation,

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,030
that we're going to talk a lot about.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,700
We also might talk about the variability
or

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,420
spread of the data in terms of percentiles
or something like a inter-quartile range.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,440
So the range is easy, because it's just
the difference between the largest and

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,490
smallest observations, but that's very
useful information.

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,820
So for example, when I asked my students
about how much homework they did in

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,230
hours per week, I got a range of anywhere
from zero hours per week,

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,620
all the way up to 40 hours per week.

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,660
So my range is 40 hours per week.

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,090
So it's quite a wide range,

18
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,290
it gives you a sense that the, the data is
fairly variable here.

19
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,860
Moving to the standard deviation, the
standard deviation is by far the most

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,840
common measure of variability that you're
going to see in, in statistics.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,050
So, I'm going to spend quite some time
talking about the standard deviation.

22
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,080
Really get a good understanding of it.

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,170
First of all, however, I'm going to give
you a little challenge.

24
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,500
And, if you want you can even pause the
video and

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,910
think a little bit in terms of this
challenge.

26
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,090
My challenge to you, is what if somebody,

27
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,750
somebody were to ask you to devise a
statistic.

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,300
That would give you the average distance
from the mean.

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,940
We want a statistic that tells you what is

30
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,230
the average distance of any given
observation from the mean.

31
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,140
How would you calculate that?

32
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,380
How would you come up with a statistic
that does that?

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,330
If you want, pause the video, see if you
can think it out.

34
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,240
So, probably your first instinct on this
is to,

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,740
first of all you have to think about
what's distance from the mean.

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,850
How would I quantify distance from the
mean?

37
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,800
So to measure the distance from the mean,
what you're going to want to do is

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,270
subtract an observations value from the
mean value, that will give you a distance.

39
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,450
So we can represent that in mathematical
symbols as Xi,

40
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,340
that is any given observation in your data
set.

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,300
Minus x bar, that's your mean.

42
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,530
So if you take,.

43
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,140
If somebody.

44
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,950
If the mean, in the data set is a mean
height of say, 69 inches.

45
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:17,120
Then if somebody was 71 inches, they would
be 2 inches above the mean.

46
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,200
That would be their distance from the
mean.

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,470
Or if.

48
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,670
The mean homework that you do per week is
11 hours per week,

49
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,410
and if that's the mean and you happen be
somebody who does 40 hours per week,

50
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,340
then you would be 29 hours per week above
the mean, that would be your distance.

51
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,850
If you only did 0 hours per week,

52
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,970
you would be negative 11 hours per week
away from the mean.

53
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,170
So that would be the distance from the
mean.

54
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,570
So that's the quantity distance.

55
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,100
But then, how do you get the average
distance from the mean?

56
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,280
Well, we know how to calculate an average,
right?

57
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,910
So to get the average distance from the
mean.

58
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,750
Your instinct, your first instinct would
be just to calculate an average of

59
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,130
those distances, right?

60
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,470
So again in mathematical symbols, what you
would do is you would add up all of those

61
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,370
distances, so each observation in your
data set has a distance from the mean.

62
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,660
You could add all of those up and then
divide by n to get the average.

63
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,090
Right, that's a good first instinct.

64
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,200
Of course there's a problem with that.

65
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,640
There's going to be a problem with that
quantity, right.

66
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,149
So what's the problem with that?

67
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,310
Well, the problem with that is it's
going to fail,

68
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,945
because remember that some of the
distances are going to be negative,

69
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:24,760
and some of the distances are going to be
positive.

70
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,920
Some people do more homework, some people
do less homework.

71
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,299
In fact, if you add up all of those
negatives and

72
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:32,560
positives, you're going to get exactly
zero.

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,740
So when you try to calculate the standard
deviation in this way,

74
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,160
it actually completely fails because you
end up with a value of zero.

75
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,670
And that's because you've got negatives as
well as positives.

76
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,930
So the problem is the negative, so the
next thing you might think is,

77
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,450
well how am I going to get rid of the
negatives?

78
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,620
What do we do in math to, if we don't want
to deal with negatives?

79
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,140
So how can I get rid of negatives?

80
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,870
Your first instinct on this might be to
turn to absolute values, right.

81
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,660
You if you take the absolute value,

82
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,730
you could do the absolute values of the
distances.

83
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,250
And that would get rid of the negatives.

84
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,775
It's not going to add up to zero anymore.

85
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:08,698
However, it turns out that it's very

86
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:11,790
messy mathematically to deal with absolute
values.

87
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,860
Right?
If you remember back to

88
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,780
like algebra two in high school.

89
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,500
When you deal with absolute values, funny
things happens.

90
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,390
Like less than signs got flipped around to
greater than signs, and

91
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,100
all these kinds of funny things.

92
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,830
So, mathematically we don't want to deal
with absolute values.

93
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,160
So what's another way to get rid of
negatives?

94
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,310
Another way to get rid of negatives is to
square things.

95
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,750
So that's actually what we're going to do.

96
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,500
This is how we're going to calculate
standard deviation.

97
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,300
We're going to square all of the distances
from the mean in order to

98
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,810
eliminate the negatives.

99
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,740
So rather than take the raw distances from
the mean and add them up, we're going to

100
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,793
square those distances first and add up
these squared distances from the mean and

101
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:53,620
get the average squared distance from the
mean.

102
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,510
This is something that we call a variance
and

103
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:01,840
sym, in terms of symbols I represent this
as an S squared.

104
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,330
S will be the standard deviation so S
squared is what we call the variance.

105
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,100
So S squared, the variance is the average
squared distance from the mean.

106
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,670
And I'll just write it out one more time
here.

107
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:17,510
Formally, I just want to point out that
the official Formula for

108
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,850
variance which I've now got up.

109
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,080
We've got, we've got to the official
formula here for variance.

110
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,950
Again, S squared is my, this is symbols I
used to represent, sample variance.

111
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,920
Notice that the formula look, looks just
slightly different because there's, in

112
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,930
the denominator I'm not dividing by n to
calculate the average, which is the way.

113
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,250
We usually calculate average in dividing
by N minus 1 this is

114
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,500
a little technical point but I just want
you to understand why its there so

115
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,360
it turns out that the reason we're
dividing by N minus 1 here is that

116
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,200
we've lost what's called a degree of
freedom.

117
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,700
So.

118
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,430
When we calculate variance or

119
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,350
standard deviation, we have to calculate
something else first.

120
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,960
We have to calculate the mean first.

121
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,820
By calculating that mean, we loose what's
called the degree of freedom.

122
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,290
And we're therefore only have negative- 1
degrees of freedom, so

123
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,220
that's why we're dividing by n 1, rather
than 1.

124
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,700
For all practical purposes, it doesn't
usually make a huge difference, right,

125
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,100
whether you divide by n, or n - 1, because
as long as n is pretty big.

126
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,130
You know, whether you divide by 99 or

127
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,290
divide by 100, it's not going to make a
huge difference.

128
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,800
But that's why, technically, that's in the
denominator.

129
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,790
So what's a degree of freedom?

130
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,160
One degree of freedom is, is, let's say
I've got a data set of 100 people.

131
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,200
And I were to give you, and

132
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,770
I were to calculate the, the mean for that
100 people.

133
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,614
Let's say the, the mean age.

134
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:44,150
And I were to give you the mean, and I
were to give, and I were to give you 99,

135
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,510
the ages for 99 of the other people in the
data set.

136
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,430
If you had 99 of the ages and the mean
age,

137
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,870
you would be able to calculate back for me
exactly that hundredth person.

138
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,190
So that means that once you've calculated
the mean You only have 99 degrees of

139
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,860
freedom left because that last person,
that hundredth person, is fixed.

140
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,330
They can't be anything else.

141
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,860
Once you have 99 and the mean, there's
nothing else that that person can be.

142
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,570
So you've lost what we call a degree of
freedom.

143
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,710
Again, that's a technical thing, but

144
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,320
it will come up again, so I just want to
point out that that's there.

145
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,660
Of course we start by calculating the
variance,

146
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,190
the average squared distance from the
mean.

147
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,080
But that you would, you know, if you, you
don't ever report the variance in

148
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,980
your paper because that would mean you'd
be reporting things in,

149
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,900
like, age squared, years squared, homework
hours squared.

150
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,990
Of course, we're going to want to get back
to the units of the original data, so

151
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,000
we're going to Square rooted and

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,460
that's what the standard deviation is it's
the square root of the various so

153
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,780
we start with the various and we square
root it to get the standard deviation to

154
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,480
get back to the original units and I use
as a symbol for

155
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,500
that I use s so s squared is the various s
is the sample standard deviation.

156
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,670
So, that's just to take a square root to
get back to the original unit that's what

157
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,560
your standard deviation is.

158
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,970
Now I just want to point out that there
are consequences to

159
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,290
the fact that we did this little squaring
routine.

160
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,740
So the standard deviation, at the end of
the day,

161
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,380
is not exactly the average difference from
the mean.

162
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,170
It represents sort of the average spread
or

163
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,130
the average scatter but it's not exactly
the average distance.

164
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,500
We have this little squaring trick in
there, right?

165
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,630
And so one of the consequences of that
squaring trick is that

166
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,070
things that are farther from the mean are
actually going to have more influence.

167
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,440
Are going to contribute more to

168
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,680
the standard deviation than values closer
to the mean.

169
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,940
So, for example, if the mean is 5,

170
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,750
then if you're talking about a value of 6
you're only one away from the mean.

171
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,830
If you square 1 you're still at 1.

172
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,260
But if you were 5 away the mean and

173
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,490
square 5 your amplifying that distance so
now it's a distance of 25.

174
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,620
So we're going to,

175
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:51,100
all this says is when you have values that
are extreme those are going to have a lot

176
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,092
of influence on the standard devaition in
the same way they influence the mean.

177
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:59,190
Let me just give a, an example calculation
here of

178
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,730
how you'd actually go about calculating
the standard deviation by hand.

179
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,440
So remember we had this little
hypothetical data set,

180
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,520
which had eight people with eight ages in
it.

181
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,490
They ranged from 17 to 38.

182
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,510
We calculated in a previous module that
the mean for this data set was 23.25.

183
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,310
So again, we have to calculate the mean
before we

184
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,290
can calculate The standard deviation.

185
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,650
To calculate the standard deviation I'm
going to take each of

186
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:26,090
these individual ages and subtract the
means and then square it.

187
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:32,170
So, for example the person who's 17, they
are 6.25 years away from the mean.

188
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,970
So we're going to take 6.25 and I'm
going to square it.

189
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,910
Person who is 19 is 4.25 units away from
the mean.

190
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,990
So I'm going to take 4.25, and I'm
going to square that.

191
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,280
I'm going to do that for each of the 8
observations.

192
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,070
So I end up in the numerator with a sum of
8 squares.

193
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,930
I'm going to add those up, and then I'm
going to divide here by 8 minus 1.

194
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,790
Because, again, we've lost 1 degree of
freedom.

195
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,220
So we always divide by n minus 1.

196
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,010
So we're diving by 7.

197
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,340
And then let's take the square root of
that whole thing.

198
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,730
To get back to the standard deviation,

199
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,800
I come up if I calculate this all out with
a value of 6.3.

200
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,240
What does that value of 6.3 actually mean?

201
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,030
So again, this is trying to get at the
average distance from the mean.

202
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,150
So, this is saying that roughly the
average scatter around the mean

203
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,890
is 6.3 years.

204
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,390
Now, if you notice, if you look at Each
individual participant here, like.

205
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,468
There's a person who's 17.

206
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:25,854
Well 17 is, isalmost 6.3 away from the
mean, but not quite.

207
00:10:25,854 --> 00:10:32,045
19, 21, 22, 23, 23, 23, they're all much
less than 6.3 away from the mean.

208
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:34,820
So it's not looking like the average
distance from the mean is really

209
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,780
anywhere around 6 but we have 1 person
whose really far from the mean.

210
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,010
Their 38 when everybody else is in their
early 20s or teens.

211
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,840
That person, is, is because they're far
from the mean,

212
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,480
they're having a lot of influence.

213
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,220
That person is driving the fact that this
6.3 value is so high.

214
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,620
So, again, you know,

215
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,340
if you're far from the mean you can have a
lot of influence on, on the variance or

216
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,982
the standard deviation, and so that's why
that comes out to be 6.3 there.
