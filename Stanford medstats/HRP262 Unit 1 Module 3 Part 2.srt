1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,040
Now let's go through a real example in
more detail with some real data.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,380
So this is an example that involves time
to conception in women who want to

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:09,990
get pregnant.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,990
So just to show you that we don't always
have to have bad outcomes in

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,050
survival analysis.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,220
Failure here.

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,920
Failing to survive is a good thing.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,970
You, these women want to get pregnant.

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,720
So this was some data on 38 women who got,
who all received the same treatment for

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,590
infer, infertility.

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,750
So there's only one group here.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,070
And the researchers followed them for up
to two years.

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,018
To mark the time to conception.

14
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:36,220
And, again, the event is conception.

15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,860
I'm going to say that the women survived
pregnancy free until they conceived.

16
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,290
But of course, again, they, they want to
fail here.

17
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,890
They want to su, to, to get pregnant.

18
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,020
This, this data set is nice and easy to
work with.

19
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,720
Because women can only get pregnant once a
month.

20
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,320
So the time here is just in months.

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,800
And everybody has one opportunity to get
pregnant one time per month.

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,720
So here's actually the raw data.

23
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,870
The reason I chose this example,

24
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,460
is somebody had actually published the raw
data.

25
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,250
They're nice and simple.

26
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,960
We can look at the raw data and see how it
translates to a Kaplan-Meier curve.

27
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,070
Let me just show you the full
corresponding Kaplan-Meier curve for

28
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,260
these data.

29
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,620
So here is the Kaplan-Meier curve for

30
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,760
the data that I just showed you, already
drawn out.

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,380
I'm going to walk you through where it
comes from in a minute.

32
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,240
Just note that this is a step wise curve,
that has nine steps to it.

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,230
There are nine unique event times.

34
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,110
Nine unique months in which women got
pregnant.

35
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,890
So we're going to drop the curve nine
times, for those nine event times.

36
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,780
If no pregnancies happened in a given
month,

37
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,000
we don't drop the curve in that month.

38
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,240
Alright.

39
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,920
So how do we translate this into
Kaplan-Meier estimates?

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,690
So, starting with what happens in month
one.

41
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,450
So, in month one, six women conceived.

42
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,740
There were 38 women at risk of conceiving
in month one, who were in the study.

43
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,460
Six of them conceived.

44
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,420
So 6 out of 38 get pregnant.

45
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,930
Which means that 32 out of 38 survive that
first month pregnancy free.

46
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,120
And we can represent that on the curve
here.

47
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,110
So, sorry, this is just what I just said.

48
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,620
Six women conceived in the first month,

49
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,850
32 out of 38 survived pregnancy free past
the first month.

50
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,740
So we're going to drop the curve down to
32 out of 38,

51
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,710
because this is the survival probability.

52
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,320
32 out of 38 made it past the first month
pregnancy free.

53
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,450
Of course they, they don't want to.

54
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,650
The outcome here is something that they
actually want to happen.

55
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,290
Now we can also say, well, what percent of
women got pregnant in a, a given month?

56
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,418
So in month one, there were 6 out of 38
who got pregnant, so 15.8% got pregnant.

57
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:31,740
We're going to call that something called
a hazard rate,

58
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,370
which we're going to return to in some
future modules.

59
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,620
So I'll just point out that the hazard
rate for month one here was 15.8%.

60
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,080
The survival probability is about 84%.

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,520
Alright, what happened next?

62
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,340
So, the next thing that happened in our
dataset,

63
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,038
is that at, in the second cycle, the
second month, five women conceived.

64
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:53,740
And nobody is censored yet.

65
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,970
There's one woman in the censoring list
who has a value of 2.

66
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,910
But just understand that the way these
data were set up,

67
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,570
when we say she censored at two months.

68
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,410
What we mean by that,

69
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,680
is that she made it through two cycles,
two months, pregnancy free.

70
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,420
And at the last time we saw her she, she
was not pregnant.

71
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,460
But she's going to contribute two months
to the study.

72
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,470
So the, we know that she didn't get
pregnant in that second month.

73
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,850
That's just the way the data are coded
here.

74
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,220
So that means we won't have, the censoring
won't occur until after the pregnancies.

75
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,620
So now, what happened in the second month?

76
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,090
Five women conceived.

77
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,080
There were 32 women at risk.

78
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,740
Because we lost six in the first month who
got pregnant.

79
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,840
So 27 out of 32 did not get pregnant.

80
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,680
So they survived the second interval, the
second month, pregnancy free.

81
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,040
So the chances of surviving that second
interval pregnancy free,

82
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,400
if you started the interval, were 84.4%.

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,090
To get the cumulative probability of
surviving past two months.

84
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,060
We have to multiply, the probability from
the first interval times

85
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,720
the probability from the second interval.

86
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,522
So now the curve is dropped down here to
about 71%.

87
00:03:57,522 --> 00:04:01,272
So 71% are going to be pregnancy free at
the end of two months.

88
00:04:01,272 --> 00:04:04,230
About 30% would, would conceive in the
first two months.

89
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,900
Now the hazard rate for the second month.

90
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,480
If you make it to month two pregnancy
free.

91
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,945
If you don't get pregnant in the first
month,

92
00:04:11,945 --> 00:04:14,220
what's your chance of getting pregnant in
the next month?

93
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,290
Its actually pretty similar to the first
month.

94
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,120
5 out of 32 got pregnant in month two.

95
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,550
And so the hazard rate here, what were
going to call the hazard rate is 15.6%.

96
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,370
I'll just kind of kind of want to point
out the hazard rates,

97
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,690
because were going to return to those up
in a future module.

98
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,510
So, pretty constant rate of getting
pregnant here.

99
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,000
Alright.
What happens next?

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,260
So, in the third month, three women get
pregnant.

101
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,030
One woman, this woman, gets censored right
after the second month.

102
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,540
So she's gone out of the risk set.

103
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,275
She's no longer at risk of getting
pregnant, we've lost her.

104
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:48,700
So the risk set, the the number of women
who could get pregnant in,

105
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,050
in the third cycle at, in month three, is
only 26 women.

106
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,450
Out of those 26 women, three get pregnant.

107
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,640
23 out of 26 don't get pregnant.

108
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,740
These, they're, they survive the third
month pregnancy-free.

109
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,660
To get the cumulative probability of
survive, surviving past three months,

110
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,970
we multiply the first three intervals
together.

111
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,586
So now the curve is down to 62.8%.

112
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:13,871
So that's saying that your chances of
surviving past

113
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:18,236
three months pregnancy-free, our estimate
of that is 62.8%.

114
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:22,179
I'll just point out the hazard rate for
the third month was 3 out of 26.

115
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:25,030
26 were at risk of getting pregnant, 3
did.

116
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,460
So the hazard rate here is just slightly
smaller than the,

117
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,019
the first two months, it's 11.5%.

118
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:32,531
And we can keep going.

119
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,387
So now if we go to the fourth month,

120
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:36,979
there's now two women who have been
censored.

121
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:37,954
So they're dropped out, and

122
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,956
then of course all these other women have
gotten pregnant.

123
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:45,711
So we're down to 22 women, 3 women out of
those 22 get pregnant.

124
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:47,721
So 19 do not get pregnant.

125
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:52,002
So 19 out of 22 survive the fourth month
pregnancy free.

126
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:55,500
So we add that to our cumulative
probability here.

127
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,020
That means our curve is going to drop
down.

128
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,000
If you multiply all of these together our
curve drops down here to 54%,

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,690
you can see that on the Kaplan-Meier curve
here.

130
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,860
The hazard rate for the fourth month.

131
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,214
For month four, turned out to be 13.6%.

132
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:09,730
3 out of 22 did get pregnant.

133
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,320
So that's the hazard rate for the fourth
month.

134
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,290
And we can keep going here.

135
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,680
So at six months no, notice that nobody
got pregnant in month five.

136
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,370
On the pregnancy side there's, there's
nobody at month five.

137
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,870
So we're just going to draw the curve past
month five.

138
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,130
We're not going to draw up the curve again
until we get to month six.

139
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,080
At month six, how many woman are still at
risk?

140
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,750
Well, now we've censored three women.

141
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,210
So we're down to 18 women who are at risk
of getting pregnant.

142
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,800
In our study at month six, 2 got pregnant
and 16 did not.

143
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,450
So the chances of surviving that interval,
pregnancy free was 16 out of 18.

144
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:48,390
So we're going to add that and multiply
that into our cumulative probability here.

145
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,410
Our cumulative probability at four months
was 54.2%.

146
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,580
We can just multiply that to the
probability for month six.

147
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,280
We get that our, now our total probability
of surviving past six months

148
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,256
pregnancy free is about 42%.

149
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:01,950
So the way you could use these data,

150
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,790
is you could say to a woman who is getting
this procedure.

151
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,950
Well, we expect about 60% of women to get
pregnant in the first six

152
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,690
months after having this procedure, and
about 40% to not get pregnant.

153
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,540
To, to survive six months pregnancy free,
to use,

154
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,410
again, the language of survival analysis.

155
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,370
And we can keep going here.

156
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,420
I, I decided that I didn't need to go
through ev, walk you through every step.

157
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,880
I think you get the idea.

158
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,030
By the way, the little stars here are
indicating where women are censored.

159
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,800
That's what those stars are.

160
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,530
And, I'm just going to drop ahead, skip
ahead a little bit here.

161
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,730
So we were at six months.

162
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,312
I'm going to skip ahead to 13 months.

163
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:40,240
Which is the second to last event time, in
which pregnancies actually occurred.

164
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,200
By the time we get down to 13 months now,

165
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,832
there's only 22% of women who wouldn't be
pregnant, or pregnant by then.

166
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:49,830
And, then let me just do the very last
event time.

167
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,930
So, were're at 22% at 13 months.

168
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,300
The very last, after 13 months, there's
one more pregnancy.

169
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,720
There's one woman who gets pregnant in the
16th month of the study.

170
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,900
At 16 months, there's a lot of women
who've been censored.

171
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,480
A lot of women whom are pregnant.

172
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,450
So there's actually only two remaining at
16 months.

173
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:10,920
On this side, there's three total women
who are at risk of getting pregnant.

174
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,300
At 16 months, one gets pregnant, two
don't.

175
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,270
So that interval,

176
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,700
the probability of surviving that interval
pregnancy free is 2 3rds.

177
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,790
We multiply that to the cumulative
probability from before, 22%.

178
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,270
We drop our curve down to 15%.

179
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,560
And then the last two women are censored.

180
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,720
They never get pregnant during the time
point of the, course of the study.

181
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,350
So we just draw the curve all the way
over.

182
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,950
And that represented here.

183
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,650
So that is our Kaplan-Meier estimate of
the survival curve.

184
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,790
I'll just point out to you, that if you
look at the end of the curve.

185
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:44,160
Notice that by the end of the curve, we
only have three women at risk.

186
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,910
And when you have three women at risk and
one gets pregnant.

187
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,780
We're now multiplying this curve, this
22%, by 2 3rds.

188
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,790
So the curve drops quite a bit here,

189
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,040
even though this represents only a single
woman getting pregnant.

190
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,510
What you'll notice at the end of
Kaplan-Meier curves is,

191
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,610
you end up, usually, with not too many
women or people left.

192
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,250
And so the estimates can get very wiggly,
right?

193
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,740
There's a lot of potential for variability
when you have only a few people.

194
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,780
So just be cautious about interpreting the
end of Kaplan-Meier curves.

195
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,520
Because often the sample size is pretty
small by then.

196
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,310
And you know, things may jump around that
don't represent anything real.

197
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,670
It just represents noise.

198
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,505
So what you get out of the computer is you
get this picture of this

199
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:26,550
Kaplan-Meier curve.

200
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,590
You'll get the picture.

201
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,880
You will also get the estimates of the,
the actual specific values of

202
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,700
these survival probabilities at every
event time.

203
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,500
In SAS the output looks something like
this.

204
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,968
So the estimate of probability of
surviving pass month one,

205
00:09:40,968 --> 00:09:42,560
that's equal to 84%.

206
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,770
You can get the, the actual specific value
here.

207
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:50,472
Sometimes on the graphic it's hard to get
the specific values.

208
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:53,520
And for two months the survival
probability was 71%.

209
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,600
At three months it was 62% and so on.

210
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,090
It's also giving you the probability, the
failure probability.

211
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,375
Which is just 1 minus the survival
probability.

212
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,730
And survival curves do come with some
standard errors.

213
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,080
So it is possible to put confidence
intervals around them,

214
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,500
although that sometimes makes the graphic
kind of messy.

215
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,470
SAS also tells you the number who have
failed.

216
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,690
And the number remaining at risk, at each
time point.

217
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,410
So you can get all of that output out of
your computer program as well.
