1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,760
The correct answer here is b, if our
probability is 0.5, then our logit is

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,830
going to be, remember our logit is the
natural log of p divided by 1 minus P.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,720
So that's 1 minus p will be 0.5.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,970
We did the natural log of 0.5 over 0.5,
that's just the natural log of 1 so

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,406
that will come out to be 0.

6
00:00:18,406 --> 00:00:22,100
If the logit, again,

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:28,230
the natural log of P divided by 1 minus P,
then the log odds is equal to 1.0.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,608
What's the corresponding probability
going to be?

9
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:33,950
Well, you could use some algebra to solve
this.

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,100
You can also see that in some of the
modules I alluded to that.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,380
There's a little formula to solve this
that will that will give you if you

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,690
put in the the logit where I, where x is
here, that will give you the probability.

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,510
But we can solve this algebraically.

14
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,185
So you would just exponentiate both sides
here,

15
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:53,970
that's where we get the exponential in
here.

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,638
And we would exponentiate both sides, and
then you could multiply both sides by 1

17
00:00:57,638 --> 00:01:05,810
minus P so we would get that P is to e
raised to 1 times 1 minus P, in this case.

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,340
So P is equal to e minus e times P and

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,810
again e raised to 1, I should carry that
over.

20
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,710
And then we were trying to isolate here
what's the probability, so

21
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:24,150
I'm going to do P plus e raised to 1 times
P is equal to e.

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,950
I'm just adding that to both sides of the
equation.

23
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:32,100
Then I can divide out here, this is equal
to P times 1 plus e

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,220
raised to 1 and then I can cancel that on
both sides of the equation.

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,780
So there's a little general formula.

26
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,330
Again, if x is the logit here, you would
just plug in e raised to

27
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,120
the logit divided by 1 plus e raised to
the logit.

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,700
And we've kind of solve that here.

29
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,290
So I plug in 1 here.

30
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,210
We actually get that that is equal to a
probability of 0.73 so

31
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,874
the correct answer here is 73% which is e.

32
00:02:01,874 --> 00:02:04,705
An ROC curve with an area under the curve
of

33
00:02:04,705 --> 00:02:08,370
50% has absolutely no predictive ability,
no better than chance, so

34
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,816
an ROC curve with a, an area under the
curve of 52% is, is bad.

35
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:16,825
So that C is correct, the model has poor
predictive ability.

36
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:24,207
The researchers fit a model here that the
log odds of hypertension,

37
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:28,530
that's our binary outcome is equal to our,

38
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,470
our intercept is 0.2 and our slope is
negative 0.2 times the sleep duration.

39
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,670
This is a cons, a continuous predictor.

40
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,050
So, what does the intercept actually mean
here?

41
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,592
Well, the intercept alone is only going to
be applied when our sleep duration is

42
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:45,150
equal to zero, that will make this whole
term go out.

43
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,280
So the intercept here represents the
predicted logit,

44
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,410
the predicted log odds of hypertension for
someone who sleeps zero hours per night.

45
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,830
Of course, there, it's physiologically
impossible to sleep zero hours per night,

46
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,940
so this person doesn't really exist, but

47
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,940
that is what the intercept would
represent.

48
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,060
So we're given a logistic regression
equation here.

49
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,360
The beta coefficient is negative 0.2.

50
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,790
That is a direct interpretations as an
odds ratio, so we just exponentiate

51
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,736
the beta coefficient of negative 0.2, that
gives us an odds ratio of 0.82.

52
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:18,402
So C, 0.82, is the correct answer here.

53
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:24,230
So first we have to calculate the
predicted logit here.

54
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,320
So our predictive logit,

55
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,900
again, our intercept is 0.2, where minus
.2 times the sleep duration,

56
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,350
which here is 6, that's going to give us a
predicted logit of -1.0.

57
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,390
So that's our predicted logit of
hypertension, that is the log odds.

58
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,530
We have to then convert that logit back to
a probability.

59
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,422
We can convert to a probability by
remembering that e raised to the logit

60
00:03:48,422 --> 00:03:53,300
divided by 1 plus e raised to the logit,
yeah, is equal to the probability.

61
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,141
So, we would just plug in here the
predicted logits of -0.1 or

62
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:05,310
-1.0, excuse me and that gives us a
predicted probability of 27%.

63
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,326
So somebody who sleeps six hours per night
is predicted to have a 20%,

64
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:11,100
7% chance of hypertension.

65
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,179
The correct answer is A.

66
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,740
The correct answer is B here.

67
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:23,690
The units for the odds ratios are one
standard deviation increases in BMI.

68
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:29,140
So, in one standard deviation increasing
BMI corresponds to an odds ratio of 2.05.

69
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,919
It doubles your odds of breast cancer, so
B is correct.

70
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,660
Odds ratios can exaggerate effect sizes.

71
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,260
They exaggerate effect sizes when you're
outcome is common.

72
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,720
Well fortunately, breast cancer is one of
the most common cancers, but

73
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,160
it's still not very common.

74
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,302
The the general rule of thumb is if the
prevalence is less than

75
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:52,350
10% then that's considered sufficiently
rare,

76
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,450
that an odds ratio will be close enough to
a risk ratio, will be close to risk ratio.

77
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,130
So the correct answer here is B, breast
cancer is

78
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,341
sufficiently rare that the odds ratio and
the risk ratio will be simillar.

79
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,930
So, in this question, we're given two
logit plots, and

80
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,200
the logit plot depends on the bending in
order to be

81
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,660
able to calculate the percentage of people
with the outcome.

82
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,260
And therefore, the logit, the log odds of
people with the outcome,

83
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,110
you have to bend people in your data set,
group them.

84
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,280
So I've done two graphics here.

85
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,120
One with 12 bends, and

86
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,160
one with four bends, just to give us a
sense of the relationship here.

87
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,500
What we're doing in a logistic regression
is we are fitting a model where our

88
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,860
predictor here, our continuous predictor
is the number of menstrual cycles per

89
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,490
year, and we're fitting a line with the
logit.

90
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,950
That's what we do in a logistic
progression model.

91
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,490
We lo, the, we fit a line so we have an
intercept and

92
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,080
we have a beta and then in this case,

93
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,520
our, our continuous predictor is the
number of menstrual cycles per year.

94
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,380
Well, the line is going to be something
like this and something like this.

95
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,950
Of course, of course neither of these is,

96
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:59,090
is exact because we can't plot the logit
exactly it depends on the bidding.

97
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,310
If you just kind of eyeball it,

98
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,580
you'll see that only on the left graph do
we go through 0,

99
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,652
through the y, x equals 0, through the
y-axis, that happens somewhere around 1.

100
00:06:07,652 --> 00:06:11,020
It's not going to be it's more closer on
this graph to 1.1, but

101
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,720
it's not going to happen exactly there,
because of course when you fit a line,

102
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,410
it's not going to go exactly through that
point.

103
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,370
So somewhere around 1,

104
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,170
the correct answer has to be somewhere, an
intercept of somewhere around +1.

105
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,950
Then to calculate the slope, we can use
both graphics and

106
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,500
just say what's the change in y over the
change in X, roughly here.

107
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,160
Well, I'm just sort of eyeballing it.

108
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,540
For the first graph, it looks like maybe
we go down about 2.5.

109
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,120
We're going down, so it's a negative
slope.

110
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,460
At the, for the y, and we go from zero to
12 in x,

111
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:44,280
so somewhere around maybe -2.08, somewhere
around that for the slope.

112
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,640
For the other picture, we can also
estimate, again,

113
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,647
it's somewhere, I'm estimating that it
goes down about 1.7 in x y and

114
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,840
x changes from 3 to 12, which is a change
of 9.

115
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,650
So that also gives us a slope of around
-0.2.

116
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,490
So the correct model here would be about 1
minus 0.2 times x here,

117
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,540
which is the number of menstrual cycles
per year.

118
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,098
So the correct answer would be c.

119
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:13,560
So, this picture is showing us potentially

120
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,880
interaction because it's showing us that
there is a bigger slope for

121
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,970
the people who are not depressed than for
the people who are depressed.

122
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,590
The dotted line are the depressed people.

123
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,000
They don't seem to get as much benefit, in
terms of a reduction in inflammation.

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,932
As the depress, the non-depressed people
do, that's the darker line.

125
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:33,470
The non-depressed people get a big drop in
inflammation if they

126
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,870
drink occasionally or regularly.

127
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,950
So there seems to be a difference in the
relationship between drinking and

128
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,080
information levels for depressed people
versus non-depressed people.

129
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,780
That would indicate an interaction.

130
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,740
But what would the actual proof of
interaction be here?

131
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,810
In order to prove interaction, what would
prove it here is that the slope for

132
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,910
this group would be significantly
different from the slope for

133
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,370
the non-depressed group.

134
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,520
So the slopes actually have to be
significantly different from one

135
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,485
another to prove that there really is a
significantly different

136
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:09,400
relationship between those two group.

137
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,080
So the correct answer here is B.

138
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,840
So I'm asking you about how these hazard
ratios where calculated here you,

139
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,660
these are going to be dummy-coded.

140
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,430
So, the obese overweight underweight is a
four-level categorical variable.

141
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,990
They're being compared to normal weight
women.

142
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,380
So we have a four-level categorical
variable that we're going to

143
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,536
have to dummy-code.

144
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:38,505
If you read carefully, it also tells you
that we've been, that these have been

145
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:41,910
adjusted for age and education if you read
the top of that column.

146
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,700
So you know that your natural log

147
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,747
of your hazard rate here is going to be
equal to we're going to have

148
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:59,415
an intercept plus we have to have a beta
for obese plus a beta for

149
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:07,700
overweight plus a beta for underweight.

150
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,850
And plus, we have to,

151
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,110
also, we're adjusting for age and for
education which are continuous variables.

152
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,998
So we have the dummy-coded variable.

153
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:19,620
It's a four-level categorical variable so
we need three binary variables in

154
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,970
the model to, to, to, to represent that
plus we're adjusting for agent education.

155
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,660
So the correct answer here would be B.

156
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:32,380
So the correct answer here is A.

157
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,250
We would interpret this odds ratio of
1.59,

158
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,450
the reference group here is the normal
weight women.

159
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:42,870
This is the relative increase in in the
rate of dementia, of developing dementia.

160
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,940
So, women who were obese at midlife had a
significant, and this is significant

161
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,958
because it does not across 1.0, the 99%
confidence interval does not cross 1.0.

162
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,960
So it's a significant 59%t increase in the
rate of developing dementia compared with

163
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,432
women who were normal weight at midlife,
and it is adjusted for age and education.

164
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:04,950
So A is correct.

165
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,830
One of the key assumptions of the Cox
Regression model is

166
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,130
something called the Proportional Hazards
Assumptions.

167
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,902
And what that says is that the relative
difference in

168
00:10:12,902 --> 00:10:16,556
the hazard rate between different groups
has to be constant over time,

169
00:10:16,556 --> 00:10:18,510
we have to have proportional hazards.

170
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,500
That hazard ratio which we are seeing here
can't change over time

171
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,980
because we're representing it here as a
single hazard ratio.

172
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,150
So the answer D here would be correct.

173
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,040
The relative differences in the hazard
rates between the different weight groups

174
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,131
must be constant over time.
