2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,091
This video is going to review for you the
mechanism of homologous recombination.

3
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:17,980
Homologous recombination will actually
repair DNA double-strand breaks.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,057
And here is a picture of a DNA
double-strand break.

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,940
And here is a picture of homologous DNA
that is

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:32,210
going to be used as the template for
repairing that double-strand break.

7
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,180
And I'm going to be very careful about how
I draw this diagram because I'm going to

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:43,340
put in the five prime and three prime ends
of the DNA, of every location.

9
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,490
And I've drawn the five prime and three
prime ends of the homologous DNA in

10
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:54,790
a way that will allow the diagram to be
very simple.

11
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:00,056
So, the first thing that happens after the
double-strand break is created,

12
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:04,604
to send this down the pathway of
homologous recombination, an exon

13
00:01:04,604 --> 00:01:10,217
nucleus has to come along and remove some
of the DNA near the double-strand break.

14
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:14,306
Indeed, what the exon nucleus will do is

15
00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:20,093
shoo back DNA to leave three prime
protruding ends.

16
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:27,632
So, I'm going to have my nucleus come in
and create three prime protruding ends.

17
00:01:27,632 --> 00:01:34,050
Then, after the three prime protruding
ends are created, one of the two three

18
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:40,679
prime ends can then be used to hybridize
the DNA from the homogenous chromosome.

19
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:46,489
So, the homologous chromosome, which is
drawn in red,

20
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:50,249
then has to be partially denatured.

21
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:52,890
Let me draw it right here.

22
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,150
So, here's the five prime and three prime
ends.

23
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,290
Okay, and.

24
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:07,720
[BLANK_AUDIO]

25
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,244
Some of the DNA here is displaced.

26
00:02:11,244 --> 00:02:15,190
Okay, and there are proteins that allow
this to happen.

27
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:21,287
In fact, the protein that allows this to
happen is RAD51.

28
00:02:21,287 --> 00:02:29,750
So here is the protruding, over here is
the protruding three prime overhang,

29
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,533
and it can do stra, what's called strand
invasion.

30
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:41,572
And, and it can invade the homologous

31
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:47,248
DNA duplex to displace one strand.

32
00:02:47,248 --> 00:02:53,120
Now there is another strand of DNA from
the DNA double-strand break.

33
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,453
[BLANK_AUDIO]

34
00:02:58,453 --> 00:03:01,360
And that strand I'm drawing right here.

35
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,555
Again, I'm going to keep track of the five
prime and three prime overhangs.

36
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:08,037
All right.

37
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:13,366
So, now that strain invasion has occurred,
it has displaced

38
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:19,760
some of the homologous DNA, the intact,
from the intact chromosome.

39
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,877
And that is, that displacement forms a
structure that we call a D-loop.

40
00:03:25,877 --> 00:03:30,942
And the reason it's called a D-loop is, if
you're falling asleep during this lecture,

41
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:33,072
your head will tilt to 90 degrees and

42
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:35,619
you'll suddenly wake up to see the letter
d.

43
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:37,180
Okay.

44
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,480
Now that we've formed a D-loop, DNA
polymerase can come along.

45
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,374
And at this point, at this three prime
overhang,

46
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:50,642
they can begin copying the homologous DNA.

47
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:54,230
Similarly, on the opposing strand, DNA
polymerase can copy the displaced DNA.

48
00:03:58,193 --> 00:04:00,211
When this copying finishes,

49
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:04,255
ligase can bring the strands together on
the upper strand.

50
00:04:04,255 --> 00:04:11,750
And when this copying gets to a certain
point, ligase can join.

51
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,120
And now, what you have here is the
formation of two Holliday junctions.

52
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,700
And these Holliday junctions then need to
be resolved.

53
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:28,725
The reason this pathway has become very
important recently

54
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:36,173
is because patients who have hereditary
breast cancer because

55
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:44,058
they have a mutation in either one of two
genes, BRCA1 or BRCA2.

56
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:46,133
BRCA1 or BRCA2.

57
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:51,074
If patients have, are carriers for
mutations in either of these genes,

58
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:56,888
they have a, a very high risk for getting
either breast or, or ovarian cancer.

59
00:04:56,888 --> 00:05:00,648
Such patients have strong family histories
and

60
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:05,640
the syndrome is called Hereditary Breast
and Ovarian Cancer.

61
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,858
These genes are involved in homologous
recombination and their involvement

62
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:18,660
in homologous recombination is to load
RAD51 onto the protruding single strand.

63
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,766
Now I'm going to draw some RAD51
molecules.

64
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:30,068
Here's RAD51, and here's the molecule, the
little circle.

65
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:35,574
And these RAD51 molecules basically

66
00:05:35,574 --> 00:05:42,542
facilitate the formation of, of the
D-loop.

67
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:46,460
They facilitate strand invasion and
formation of the D-loop.

68
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,310
BRCA1 and

69
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:53,833
BRCA2 work together to load RAD51 onto the
protruding three prime overhangs.

70
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:59,181
So, tumors that arise in patients who
have, who are carriers for

71
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:03,850
mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, all of those
tumors have

72
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:09,040
knocked out both alleles of BRCA1 or both
alleles of BRCA2.

73
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,679
And as a result, their tumors are
defective in homologous recombination.

74
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,799
And recent developments have now
introduced drugs that can potentially

75
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:26,135
be used to treat breast cancer because
they actually make cells defective,

76
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:33,070
that are defective in homologous
recombination particularly susceptible.

77
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,919
While leaving the patient's normal cells
alone because the patient is

78
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,641
heterozygous for permutation in BRCA1 and
BRCA2.

79
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:45,543
And so, those cells, those normal cells,
have normal homologous recombination.

80
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:48,548
Anyway, this is a very important pathway
and

81
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:54,320
I hope this has made the formation of
these Holliday junctions clear to you.

82
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,820
Thank you.
