3
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:25,534
>> Welcome back, I'm Doctor Larry Chu.

4
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:28,920
>> Hi, I'm Doctor Lauren Cornella
>> Now, in this segment,

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,590
we're going to talk about a topic that can
be confusing for

6
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,700
residents but, of course, we have a great
teacher here, Lauren, to explain it to us.

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,590
And it's cardiopulmonary bypass.

8
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,990
Of course, it's one of the very unique
things to cardiac anesthesia.

9
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,950
And we're not going to be able to make you
an expert on cardiopulmonary bypass.

10
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,170
That's not the goal of this module.

11
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,930
We want to give you an overview of the
process.

12
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,075
Lauren, what can the learners expect to
learn here?

13
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:03,060
Well, we'll be splitting this module into
two parts.

14
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,290
Part one is going to discuss going onto
bypass, and

15
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,760
I'll just tell you briefly some of the
major steps that you're going to see in

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,920
the operating room to get our patient onto
cardiopulmonary bypass, and then,

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,500
in part two of the module I'll go over the
weaning process.

18
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,060
How do we wean the patient off of
cardiopulmonary bypass?

19
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,570
I'll go some of, over some of the major
steps.

20
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,770
Now, you'll see some variations to these
steps in some cases, but

21
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,410
in the majority of cases, the steps are
going to be almost the same in every case.

22
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:37,310
So, if you can get a good introduction to
what we're calling CPB light, then you'll

23
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,420
be able to modify your knowledge when you
see it in specific cases.

24
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,070
One of the most central parts of cardiac
anesthesia is the process of

25
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,540
cardiopulmonary bypass.

26
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,550
So, in order for us to manage going on to
bypass and

27
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,870
going off of bypass, we need to have a
good understanding of it.

28
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,290
And you'll get a good basic understanding
from this module.

29
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,450
>> Great.
Well I'm super excited.

30
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,249
Let's get started.

31
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,920
>> Hi, this is Dr. Lauren Cornella.

32
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,920
We're going to be discussing the basics of
cardiopulmonary bypass.

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,540
I've split this tutorial into two parts.

34
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,540
In part one,

35
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,020
we're going to be discussing the basic
steps to go onto cardiopulmonary bypass.

36
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,150
And then in our next module, part two,

37
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,110
we'll be discussing how to wean our
patient from cardiopulmonary bypass.

38
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,550
Going on to bypass usually follows five
main steps.

39
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,020
Now, in each case, these steps might not
be exactly the same.

40
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,280
But by learning the concepts, you can be
able to follow your specific case and

41
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,570
know what's going on.

42
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,740
So briefly, let's go over the five steps
that are involved in

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,820
getting your patient on to cardiopulmonary
bypass.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,530
The first step is to establish
anticoagulation.

45
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,070
The next step is that the surgeons are
going to cannulate somewhere on

46
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,510
the arterial tree.

47
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,280
Now usually this is the ascending aorta,

48
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,430
but it can also be the right axillary
artery or the femoral artery.

49
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,250
Then, the surgeons are going to do venous
cannulation where they put

50
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,060
a cannula in one of the venous structures.

51
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,160
Usually this is the right atrium but

52
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,500
sometimes the surgeons can choose to do
what's called bicable cannulation where

53
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,310
they put a cannula in both the superior
vena cava and the inferior vena cava.

54
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,770
Or they can do what's called percutaneous
femoral venous canulation in which they

55
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,411
put a long cannula into the femoral vein
which extends all the way up into the SVC.

56
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,430
Then we're going to actually put the
patient onto cardiopulmonary bypass and

57
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,250
I'm going to explain how we do that and
then,

58
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,560
if the surgery requires the heart to be
still,

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,570
we're going to have to arrest the heart,
which means stop it from beating.

60
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,200
And we'll go into how we do that, this as
well.

61
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,299
Then, the surgeons will begin operating on
the heart.

62
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,670
Let's delve into this deeper.

63
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,370
So, this picture is going to help us
visualize the steps for

64
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,940
going on to bypass.

65
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,660
Let's orient you to the picture a little
bit.

66
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,560
Follow my orange dot, this structure here
is the right atrium.

67
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,100
This structure here is the right
ventricle.

68
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,390
This structure here is the left atrium.

69
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,580
And this structure here is the left
ventricle.

70
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,860
Up here, on the right side of the heart,

71
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,540
we have the SVC and we have the IVC which
empty into the right atrium.

72
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,370
On the left side of the heart, coming out
the ascending aorta,

73
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,570
right here, are the two coronary arteries,

74
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,910
the right coronary artery and the left
main coronary artery.

75
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,250
Further down the arterial tree,

76
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,030
the first takeoff of the great vessels is
the innominate artery here.

77
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,210
And that splits into the right common
carotid and right axillary artery.

78
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,210
Further down the aortic arch,

79
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,020
we have the left common carotid artery and
the left subclavian artery.

80
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,210
Here we have the descending aorta which
then will

81
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,250
split eventually into the femoral
arteries.

82
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,600
[SOUND] Now that we're oriented to our
picture,

83
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,761
let's begin with the steps to getting your
patient onto cardiopulmonary bypass.

84
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,780
The first step for getting your patient
safely out to cardiopulmonary bypass is to

85
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,110
establish anticoagulation.

86
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,030
Anticoagulating the patient is extremely
important to prevent

87
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,420
clotting inside the cardiopulmonary bypass
machine.

88
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,610
Now, in the majority of cases, the
anticoagulant of choice will be Heparin,

89
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,210
but in some instances you do choose a
different anticoagulant, so

90
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,050
make sure you check with your attending,
and the perfusionist in each case.

91
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,230
Heparinization actually begins with
drawing a baseline ACT,

92
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,800
which is an activated clotting time.

93
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,940
You draw this in a blood sample and give
it to the perfusionist.

94
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,120
The perfusionist will then calculate the
appropriate dose of

95
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,310
heparin for the patient.

96
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,620
Don't heparinize the patient until the
surgeon specifically asks for it.

97
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,710
At the appropriate time the surgeon will
ask for

98
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,080
heparin to be given to the patient.

99
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,490
Approximately three minutes after you
would administer the heparin, you should

100
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:09,700
draw a post Heparin ACT to ensure that the
patient is adequately anticoagulated.

101
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,590
After the patient is effectively
anticoagulated the surgeons will

102
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,000
begin to cannulate the patient for
cardiopulmonary bypass.

103
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,210
In almost all instances the side to be
cannulated first is the arterial side.

104
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,500
And I've drawn this in red so

105
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,760
that we remember that this is the arterial
cannula and it goes on the arterial tree.

106
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:36,230
The most common place to cannulate
arterially is the ascending aorta.

107
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,020
It is off,

108
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,030
also possible to cannulate the right
axillary artery or the femoral artery.

109
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,250
And these are done in some instances, so

110
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,610
you should discuss with your attending
what the cannulation plan will be.

111
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,230
But in the vast majority of cases the
ascending aorta is the site of

112
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,970
arterial cannulation.

113
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,480
In some instances, the surgeons will ask
for an epi-aortic ultrasound probe so

114
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,740
that they could scan the ascending aorta
for any plaque or calcification.

115
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,010
They will then put sutures on the
ascending aorta, and

116
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:13,858
they will put a cannula in the ascending
aorta, and I'll draw that here, like this.

117
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:18,940
[BLANK_AUDIO]

118
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,730
They'll then need to de-air this cannula,

119
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,580
fill it completely with the patient's
blood, and

120
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,689
then they'll bring the arterial line up
from the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

121
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,490
When both sides are properly deaired,

122
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,015
they will attach the arterial line to the
arterial cannula.

123
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,050
They'll then test this line, which means
that the profusionist will infuse a little

124
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,050
bit of crystalloid through this line to
make sure that it's patent and

125
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,780
to make sure that the pressure required to
infuse that crystaloid is normal.

126
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,130
Then the arterial cannulation is complete.

127
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,020
The third step is venous cannulation,

128
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,750
in which the surgeons need to place a
cannula on the right side of the heart

129
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,670
in order to drain the venous blood to the
cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

130
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,440
Now, in the vast majority of cases the
venous cannulation of choice will

131
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,420
be a cannula directly into the right
atrium.

132
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,310
There are other options though.

133
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,938
If the surgeon needs a bloodless right
atrium for the surgery, for instance,

134
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:30,560
in a tricuspid valve replacement or repair
of an interatrial septal defect.

135
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,770
The surgeons will then do by bicaval
cannulation, which means putting

136
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:40,000
a cannula in the SVC and the IVC and
connecting those two cannulas together.

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,160
There is a third option for venous
cannulation, which is percutaneous femoral

138
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,280
venous cannulation in which the surgeons
put a cannula into the femoral vein.

139
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,980
And this cannula is a long cannula that
extends all the way from the femoral vein

140
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,660
all the way up into the SVC.

141
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,740
And that's how it drains the venous blood.

142
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,448
But since we're doing an intro, we're
going to talk about the cannulation for

143
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:06,090
the most comos, common venous cannulation,
which is in the right atrium.

144
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,300
After we've cannulated the aorta,

145
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,650
the surgeons will turn their attention to
the right atrial cannula.

146
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,650
They'll put some sutures on the right
atrium, and then, they'll put

147
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,380
a cannula directly into the right atrium,
and that's indicated by this blue.

148
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:30,360
It's important to realize that there will
be a cross clamp already on

149
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,740
this right arterial cannula.

150
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,310
It's there before they cannulated the
right atrium and

151
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,410
it'll stay there until we decide to go on
bypass.

152
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:43,602
But, now that the surgeons have canulated
the right atrium, this venous cannula

153
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:49,630
is attached to a venous line which goes to
the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

154
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,270
>> The fourth step is to begin
cardiopulmonary bypass which means that we

155
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,190
are going to drain all of the venous blood
out of the venous cannula,

156
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,850
put it into the cardiopulmonary bypass
machine where it will get oxygenated,

157
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,030
the carbon dioxide will be removed.

158
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,340
The blood will be heated or cooled
depending on what's appropriate.

159
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,740
The blood will get filtered and

160
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,350
then it will get returned to the arterial
cannula into the ascending aorta.

161
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,640
This doesn't happen automatically though.

162
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,770
Someone has to decide to go on bypass,
usually the surgeon.

163
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:28,130
In order to get on bypass, we have to
remove this clamp on the venous line.

164
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,220
[BLANK_AUDIO]

165
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,846
That means that the blood will start to
drain out of the right atrium,

166
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,450
into the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

167
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,210
The perfusionist will start cycling the
machine.

168
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,420
And this arterial blood

169
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,260
will then get transfused in the arterial
cannula back to the patient.

170
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,270
Now we're on full cardiopulmonary bypass.

171
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,750
[BLANK_AUDIO]

172
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,920
The fifth and final step is to arrest the
heart if the surgeons need to

173
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,850
operate on a still heart, which most cases
do require.

174
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,470
In order to do this, the surgeon will
place an antegrade

175
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,760
cardioplegia cannula here, in the aortic
root.

176
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,980
If they're planning on doing retrograde
cardioplegia, that goes here,

177
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,910
in the coronary sinus.

178
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,100
Not all cases require retrograde
cardioplegia, so

179
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,140
talk to your attending for specifics.

180
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,500
But if the plan is for

181
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,500
retrograde cardioplegia, that goes there
in the coronary sinus.

182
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,440
Now we are not quite ready to give
cardioplegia.

183
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,470
We're missing one important thing, that's
the aortic cross-clamp.

184
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,450
We're currently on full cardiopulmonary
bypass, but

185
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,160
the heart is still moving because arterial
blood is still being

186
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,980
delivered into the ascending aorta here
and going down the coronary arteries.

187
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,820
If blood goes down the coronary arteries,
the heart beats.

188
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,710
That's just what it does.

189
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,940
But in order to give cardioplegia down the
coronary arteries and

190
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,470
stop that cardioplegia from being washed
out by this arterial blood supply,

191
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,430
we need to put an aorta cross cramp on the
ascending aorta.

192
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,775
The aorta cross cramp would then go here,

193
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:20,076
in between the arterial cannula, which is
here, and

194
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:25,920
the antegrade retrocardio, the antegrade
cardioplega which is here.

195
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,250
So, in effect.

196
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:34,190
The aortic cross clamp separates the
coronary circulation, where cardioplegia

197
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:41,320
is going to go here and the systemic
circulation

198
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,895
which is all of the oxygenated blood from
the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

199
00:12:46,895 --> 00:12:50,150
Again, this is important and sometimes
really confusing.

200
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:56,360
The aortic cross clamp is put on so that
those two circulations are separated.

201
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,510
And, so that the systemic profusion from
the arterial cannula here,

202
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,310
doesn't wash out our cardioplegia.

203
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,420
So, what happens is the surgeon puts on
the aortic cross clamp and

204
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,480
then administers antegrade and retrograde
cardioplegia, if that's their plan.

205
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,490
Then they begin their surgical operation.

206
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,060
Come back for part twp and

207
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,270
we'll discuss how to wean the patient from
cardiopulmonary bypass.

208
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,300
Hi, this is Dr Lauren Cornella.

209
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,980
Welcome to Part two of our cardiopulmonary
bypass tutorial.

210
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,230
In this part, we're going to discuss how
to come off of bypass.

211
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,750
Coming off of bypass involves six major
steps,

212
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,390
with a few smaller steps in between.

213
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,910
The first major step is reperfusion of the
myocardium.

214
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,160
And we're going to talk about all of these
steps in further detail in

215
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,690
just a little bit.

216
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,210
This firs step, reprofusion of the
myocardium is when we remove

217
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:58,520
the aortic cross clamp, the arterial blood
will go down the coronary arteries and

218
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,540
the heart will restart.

219
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,496
Then we need to prepare the heart to
perform the cardiac output.

220
00:14:04,496 --> 00:14:11,516
By this I mean that we need to ensure that
the heart has adequate rate,

221
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:16,450
rhythm, contractility, after load,

222
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,040
normal electrolytes, and normal
temperature, and we

223
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,280
have to be ventilating in, before we can
begin to come off cardiopulmonary bypass.

224
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,630
When everyone has decided that it's time
to actually ween from

225
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,590
cardiopulmonary bypass, we clamp the
venous line.

226
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:39,070
This means that we're going to stop
removing the venous blood from the right

227
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,080
atrium, and that venous blood is going to
remain in the heart.

228
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:48,920
Thus, the heart is going to take over the
cardiac output from the bypass machine,

229
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,649
and we're going to regain our pulsatile
blood pressure.

230
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,650
Once we're off bypass, and we're happy
with our cardiac rate,

231
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:03,310
rhythm, contractility, afterload, blood
pressure, and

232
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,980
our surgical repair, the surgeons will ask
for a Protamine test dose.

233
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,180
We'll test dose the Protamine to make sure
that

234
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,950
the patient doesn't have any reaction.

235
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,335
If the Protamine test does is safe,

236
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:24,148
we'll transfuse the rest of the residual
volume that's in the arterial cannula and

237
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:29,930
then we'll decannulate both the venous
side and the arterial side.

238
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,737
During or after decannulation, we'll
reverse the anticoagulation with

239
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:42,920
first 50% of the Protamine dose and then
100% of the Protamine dose.

240
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,330
We're going to talk about all of these
steps in further detail so let's tie them.

241
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,920
So, let's recap where we were at the end
of part one of this module.

242
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,540
Our patient was on full cardiopulmonary
bypass.

243
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,240
The surgeons had applied the aortic cross
clamp, and

244
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,120
had administered antergrade and retrograde
cardioplegia.

245
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,050
This made the heart stop.

246
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,040
Then they had begun their surgical
procedure.

247
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,050
That's where we are right now.

248
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:17,830
And now we're going to discuss how to wean
our patient from cardiopulmonary bypass.

249
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,020
In case you missed part one, let me orient
you to this picture,

250
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,310
which I should say is definitely not
anatomically correct,

251
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:29,100
just a representation of what it, the
patient actually looks like.

252
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,780
Here is the SVC.

253
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,040
Here is our venous cannula, which is
draining the venous blood.

254
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,730
Here's the patient's IVC here.

255
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,530
This is the patient's right atrium, here's
the right ventricle,

256
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,492
this is the left atrium, and this is the
left ventricle.

257
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:56,260
On the arterial side, here are the two
coronary arteries right here, and

258
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,350
right here, this green dot here was

259
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,710
antegrade cardioplegia and this green here
is retrograde cardioplegia.

260
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:14,350
This purple line was our aortic
cross-clamp, which I'm just going to

261
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,210
thicken up right here.

262
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:23,410
Here, on the arterial tree, is our aortic
cannula and that's where

263
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,380
the oxygenated blood is coming from the
cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

264
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,770
And then we have the arteries of the
aortic arch.

265
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,290
Here's the right axillary artery, the
right common carotid artery,

266
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:40,130
the innominate artery, the left common
carotid and the left subclavian.

267
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,550
Now that we're oriented to our picture
again, let's be,

268
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,759
begin to discuss how we wean the patient
from cardiopulmonary bypass.

269
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,010
The first step to coming off
cardiopulmonary bypass is to

270
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,900
reperfuse the patient's myocardium.

271
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,360
Now this heart has been receiving
cardioplegia and is still right now.

272
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,680
So, we can't even think about coming off
cardiopulmonary bypass until the heart

273
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,440
begins to beat again.

274
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,650
How do we do that?

275
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,940
Well, we discussed earlier in part one of
the tutorial that

276
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,600
the purpose of the aortic cross clamp is
to

277
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,370
separate the coronary circulation from the
systemic circulation, so that

278
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:24,140
the systemic circulation from the aortic
cannula doesn't wash out the cardioplegia.

279
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,280
But here that's exactly what we want to
happen.

280
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,360
We want to wash out the cardioplegia and
we want the heart to restart again.

281
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:38,650
So, in order to do this, we remove the
aortic cross clamp from the aorta,

282
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,039
and the surgeons take out their
cardioplegia cannulus.

283
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,610
This means that this warm,

284
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,340
oxygenated blood from the arterial cannula
is now going to go down the coronary

285
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,420
arteries, wash out all the cardioplegia
and the heart is going to restart.

286
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,830
Now that the heart has reprofused and

287
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,810
starts to beat, we need to prepare the
heart to perform the cardiac output.

288
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,220
That means that we're going to take
eventually,

289
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,940
we're going to take the blood from the
cardiopulmonary bypass machine and

290
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,410
we're going to allow the patient's heart
to generate the cardiac output.

291
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,440
But, this doesn't happen instantly.

292
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,120
We almost have to perform a checklist in
our head of all the conditions that

293
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,570
have to be met before we can definitively
wean from bypass.

294
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,060
By that I mean, we have to make sure the
patient has good rate.

295
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,810
You can't come off cardiopulmonary bypass
if the patient's rate is 29.

296
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,400
So if the rate is not adequate,

297
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,830
you may need to pace the patient with a
temporary pacer.

298
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,860
You need to make sure that the patient has
a good rhythm.

299
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,910
Ideally, it would be in sinus rhythm, but
if you need to pace or

300
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,090
if you need to defibrillate the heart, we
need to get the patient back into

301
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,719
an acceptable rhythm to perform the
cardiac output.

302
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,120
You also need to assess the contractility.

303
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,800
The best way of doing this is to look over
the drapes and

304
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,640
to look at the heart directly.

305
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,250
If you have a trans-esophageal echo,

306
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,960
you can also look on the echo to assess
contractility.

307
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,270
We have to make sure that we had adequate
afterload.

308
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,780
Now, the best way to assess this is to ask
the profusionist if they've been

309
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,080
running any vasopressors recently.

310
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,740
We also need to make sure that our
important electrolytes are normal,

311
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,304
specifically potassium, pH and calcium.

312
00:20:30,304 --> 00:20:35,380
Because, large abnormalities of these
electrolytes will

313
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,300
prevent us from successfully getting off
cardiopulmonary bypass.

314
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,180
The patient also has to be warm.

315
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,180
That's another part of the checklist.

316
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,330
And the last thing we have to do before we
come off bypass is start to ventilate.

317
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,960
Remember, we're going to start putting
blood back into the cardiac chambers.

318
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,100
That blood is going to go to the lungs,
and in order for

319
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,690
us to successfully get off cardiopulmonary
bypass we have to oxygenate that blood and

320
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,930
remove the carbon dioxide.

321
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,180
[BLANK_AUDIO]

322
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,440
If we've met all of those conditions,

323
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,990
we're ready to wean from cardiopulmonary
bypass.

324
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,430
What is weaning from bypass really mean?

325
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:16,520
Well, it means that instead of draining
the blood out of the right atrium and

326
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,170
putting it in the cardiopulmonary bypass
machine,

327
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,980
we're going to keep the blood in the right
atrium and put it inside the heart.

328
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,740
So the way we do this is we take a cross
clamp and

329
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,710
we cross clamp this venous cannula.

330
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,970
If we put a cross clamp across the venous
cannula,

331
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,080
we'll be no longer draining venous blood
out of their atrium.

332
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,500
And the blood that is coming from the SVC
and the from the IVC,

333
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:54,620
will then remain in the heart, and start
going through the heart,

334
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,270
through the lungs and out the ascending
aorta.

335
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:04,680
So in essence, weaning from
cardiopulmonary bypass occurs because we

336
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,970
clamp the venous line, and we deliver that
venous blood

337
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,260
back to the heart, and the heart performs
the cardiac output.

338
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,229
Once the venous cannula is completely
clamped, we are off bypass.

339
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,250
Once we're off bypass, and if the heart
looks good, the heart is

340
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,500
adequately contributing to the cardiac
output, oxygenation looks good,

341
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,340
ventilation looks good, we're happy with
the cardiac contractility.

342
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,480
We're happy with the blood pressure, and

343
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,120
we're happy with our surgical repair
whether we did a valve replacement,

344
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,770
a valve repair, then it's time to give a
protamine test dose.

345
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,370
So, in essence, once you're off bypass and
you're sure that you're going to

346
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,715
stay off bypass because things look good,
it's time to test dose with Protamine.

347
00:22:54,810 --> 00:23:00,520
Usually this is done with a 10mg dose of
Protamine to check for a reaction.

348
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,310
But this could be very
institution-specific, so

349
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,560
please check with your attending and the
perfusionists and the surgeons for

350
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,100
exactly how they like to test dose the
Protamine.

351
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,920
Once the test dose of Protamine has been
safely given to the patient,

352
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,600
we no longer need the venous cannula.

353
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,720
So, the surgeons will decannulate the
venous side.

354
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,600
Before we can decannuate the arterial side
though, it's important to

355
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,408
remember that there's still blood in the
cardiopulmonary bypass machine,

356
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:38,330
in this cannula, all the way up until it
enters the patient.

357
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:43,460
And sometimes, this can be from 800 to
1000 ccs of blood.

358
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,670
So before we can decannulate the arterial
cannula,

359
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:52,710
we need to transfuse all of this residual
volume to the patient.

360
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,980
Some surgeons like to do this in the
arterial cannula, some surgeons actually

361
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:02,520
decannulate the arterial side and insert
that cannula into the right atrium.

362
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,140
Check with your attending what your
institution likes to do.

363
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:09,050
But the bottom line is that we need to
transfuse this residual volume to

364
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,980
the patient before we can decannulate
completely the arterial side.

365
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:23,830
Once we've transfused that residual volume
then we can decannulate the arterial side.

366
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,310
So, here I am representing that on our
diagram.

367
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,760
So now, we have no further cannulas in the
patient.

368
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,180
We've transfused all of our residual
volume.

369
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:48,030
And the patient is completely
decannulated.

370
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,940
Now, we were previously only at our
Protamine test dose.

371
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,010
Usually, if after three minutes the
patient is stable,

372
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,230
the surgeon will tell you to continue with
the Protamine.

373
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,870
At our institution we continue to 50% of
the total Protamine dose,

374
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,240
then recheck with our surgeons.

375
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,830
If the surgeons are happy, they will tell
us to continue to full dose Protamine.

376
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,710
Again, this is very important and very
institution-specific, so

377
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,300
please check with your attending, your
surgeons, and

378
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,670
your perfusionists for how this is
normally done at your institution.

379
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,920
Excellent communication regarding both
heparinization and Protamine

380
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,600
is absolutely essential as mistakes in
these drugs can be catastrophic.

381
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,060
So make sure you know very clearly what
your surgeons, and what your perfusionist,

382
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,920
and what your attending wants before you
do any of these,

383
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,130
do anything with these drugs.

384
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,090
Once you're sure exactly what the surgeon
and

385
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,710
the profusionist would like you to do with
the Protamine,

386
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,770
you can continue to reverse the
anticoagulation with full dose Protamine.

387
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:56,410
After administering the full dose of
Protamine, in approximately three minutes,

388
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:59,810
you should obtain another ACT, activated
clotting time, and

389
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,010
give this to the profusionist.

390
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,320
The perfusionist will then run the sample
to make sure that you have

391
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,390
accurately reversed all of the heparin.

392
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,970
After the anticoagulation is completely
reversed,

393
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,790
you're done with that run of
cardiopulmonary bypass.

394
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,950
Congratulations, you've made it.

395
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,550
Thanks so much for watching this tutorial.

396
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,150
And we'll see you in the next module.

397
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,410
>> Great.

398
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:26,850
Well, what I'm going to do now is try to
summarize what we learned in this segment.

399
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,150
It's a little bit complicated but I'm
going to do my best.

400
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,190
Now, in part one, un Lauren explained the
steps involved in going onto bypass.

401
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:40,080
And of course, we first have to establish
adequate anticoagulation by administering

402
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,760
medications at your, your institution will
have individual policies for that.

403
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,720
But also, to establish that you've
achieved

404
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,370
effective therapeutic anticoagulation
before you continue further with

405
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:57,575
the steps with placing a patient on
cardiopulmonary bypass.

406
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:01,100
[SOUND] We also have to then place an
arterial catheter.

407
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,236
In this case, Lauren using a example of
the ascending aorta, for

408
00:27:04,236 --> 00:27:06,070
placement of the arterial catheter.

409
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,240
But that could be different with different
patients.

410
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,940
And then, placing the venous cannula, in
the right atrium, in this case.

411
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,470
But again, it could be different for
different patients.

412
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,790
And finally, the transition to
cardiopulmonary bypass involves removing

413
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,790
the cross clamp from the venous cannula so

414
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,120
the patient can be put on to the
cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

415
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,930
Now, in part two, Lauren explained how we
wean patients off of cardiopulmonary

416
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:39,930
bypass so that the patient can then retake
over, generation of

417
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:45,110
cardiac output with their own heart, and
to do that, the first thing we have to do

418
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:51,040
is to remove the cross clamp from the
aorta so that we can reperfuse the heart.

419
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,810
Once the heart is reperfused,

420
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:57,640
that's the time when we really need to
assess cardiac function to make sure that

421
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,995
the heart can be able to generate adequate
cardiac output.

422
00:28:01,995 --> 00:28:02,670
>> Mm-hm.
>> Once we

423
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,770
take the patient off of the
cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

424
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:12,430
And then, of course, we have to place the
clamp on the venous cannula, so

425
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,120
that the heart can begin to fill, and

426
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,010
take the cardiac output from the
cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

427
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,360
And then, once the heart is beating and

428
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,420
generating adequate cardiac output, that's
the time now we can decannulate.

429
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,890
We can take those cannulas out of our two
venous sites.

430
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:33,480
And then, once that's completely
established and done and we're not on

431
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,090
the machine anymore, of course, then we
can reverse the anticoagulation.

432
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:38,910
Again.

433
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,360
Each institution that you're attending
will have, methods for doing that.

434
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,470
So, very complex topic, but

435
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:50,090
I think Lauren, you did an amazing job at
actually making it understandable.

436
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,435
And again this is just an introduction.

437
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:55,128
>> Mm-hm.
>> An over view to this process and

438
00:28:55,128 --> 00:29:00,030
I think, you know, you're going to be able
to learn much more on your cardiac

439
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:09,050
anesthesia rotation, and so we look
forward to seeing you next time.

440
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:16,450

441
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:26,450
[MUSIC]
