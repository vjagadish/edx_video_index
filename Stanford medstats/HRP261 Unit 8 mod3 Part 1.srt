1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,160
In this next module, I'm going to tell you
about Poisson regression,

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,010
which is used when your outcome variable
is a count variable,

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,330
such as the number of cases of disease
occurring in a particular geographic area

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,840
during a particular time period.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,170
Before I can delve into Poisson regression
I first have to

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,720
tell you a little bit about the poi,
Poisson probability distribution.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,250
So, this is yet another probability
distribution and remember that

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,330
all the probability distribution is, is a
function that sums to 1.

9
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,490
So, if we can numerate all the possible
outcomes here,

10
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,430
their probabilities have to sum to 1.

11
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,890
That's true in the Poisson probability.

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,519
It is a discreet probability distribution.

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,260
So we can actually talk about specific
outcomes like the probability of

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,600
having 0 cases of disease or 1 case of
disease or 2, et cetera.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,363
They're counts.

16
00:00:58,363 --> 00:01:02,383
Like any probability distribution there's
a formula I can give you for

17
00:01:02,383 --> 00:01:05,300
those particular discreet outcomes.

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,430
So ,this is the Poisson probability
formula down here.

19
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,020
Mu is just the expected number of
outcomes,

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,460
the expected count during a given time
period.

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,100
So, we could talk about maybe we're
expecting 10 deaths from

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,420
H1N1 flu in a given winter in California.

23
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,900
That would be our expected value then.

24
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,650
We could then calculate the probability
that we're going to end up

25
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,070
with 9 deaths in a given winter or 11 or
10 or 8, et cetera.

26
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,470
We would just be plugging into this
formula.

27
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,140
I'm going to Actually plug some numbers in
with a real example of this formula in

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,330
a minute, so I won't delve into the
details of this formula quite yet.

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,300
I just want to point out that a Poisson
probability distribution like any

30
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,720
other probability distribution, it has a
mean and a variance.

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,710
I won't derive where they come from for
you, but I'll just tell you that again

32
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,309
the mean is just the expected count that's
going to come out in a given time period.

33
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,770
For a Poisson distribution what's really
interesting is that the mean and

34
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,370
the variance are equal.

35
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,020
If we're really got a Poisson
distribution,

36
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,520
that will be true that the mean and the
variance will be equal.

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,081
That means the standard deviation will be
the square root of the mean.

38
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:14,850
So, if we are expecting 10 cases of
disease in a given winter in

39
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,380
California then the variance for

40
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,860
that if we are really on a Poisson
distribution would also be 10.

41
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,460
It's easiest to illustrate a Poisson
distribution by just kind of showing you

42
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,080
an example with actually numbers.

43
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,420
So, let's do that now.

44
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,120
So, let's imagine that in a particular
population this might be

45
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,460
like college students.

46
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,610
The number of alcohol binging episodes in
a month

47
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,690
follows a Poisson distribution with a mean
of 4.

48
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,770
So, in this population on average, people
are binging about 4 times a month.

49
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,862
So, what's the probability, that a random
person will have 0 episodes,1 episodes,

50
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:53,070
2 episodes, 3 episodes, etc?

51
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,510
We can calculate the probability.

52
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,540
So we're somehow, assuming that there's a
constant rate here, and

53
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,970
that everybody in the population on
average is having about 4 per month.

54
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,320
So we can, this is a count, distribution.

55
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,180
And if we're really on a Poisson, then we
can calculate the Poisson probability for

56
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,070
each of these cases.

57
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,620
This.
So

58
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,190
what does the Poisson Probability looks
like?

59
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,870
They're the probability that a, kind of a
random person will have 0 episodes in

60
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,520
a given month is going to be equal to.

61
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,230
And then we just apply the Poisson
probability function.

62
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,660
Which is, you take the mean, you raise it
to the number of events,

63
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,010
the count that you're trying to calculate
the probability for.

64
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,210
Then you take e, neg raise to negative the
mean, which in this case is 4, and

65
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,970
then you do the count factorial in the
denominator.

66
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,160
So in this case, we're trying to calculate
the probability of 0 events.

67
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,660
So 4 raised to 0 here is one.

68
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,140
0 factorial is also 1.

69
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,690
So this is just going to be e raised to
negative 4,

70
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,230
which turns out to be a value of 0.018.

71
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,140
So there's only about a 1 to 2% chance
that a person's going to have no.

72
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,200
Binging episodes in a month.

73
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,740
What's the probability that x is going to
equal 1?

74
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,110
So we again, we're going to apply the
formula so that's going to be 4,

75
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,860
the mean raised to 1 e raised to the
negative 4 divided by 1 factorial.

76
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,640
And, therefore we're going to have,

77
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,860
that comes out to be a value of about 7%
of those 7% chance of having 1 episode in

78
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,620
the month let me just actually plug into
the formula one more tie to show you,

79
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,910
so for probability of having binging
episodes,

80
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,340
its going to be 4 raised to 2, e raised to
negative 4, divided by 2 factorial.

81
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,980
That comes out to be about 14.65% and then
you kind of get the pattern here.

82
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,960
I went through and calculated the rest of
these.

83
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,195
So ,there's about a 95.5% chance of 3
episodes.

84
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,345
19.5% chance of 4 episodes as the most
likely outcome.

85
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:45,155
15% chance of 5 episodes, 10% chance of 6
episodes, 5.95% chance of 7 episodes and

86
00:04:45,155 --> 00:04:49,775
if you kept going you would see that the
probabilities are going to get smaller and

87
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:53,040
smaller and smaller as we get away from
the mean.

88
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,020
If I were to add up all of these
probabilities up in to

89
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,680
the point where the probabilities get
ravishingly small They'll be almost what.

90
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,290
Of course theoretically we can go up to a
hundred episodes but by the time it

91
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,720
gets to a hundred, the probability would
be so small that essentially if

92
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,060
we add up all the probabilities it's
going to be almost, almost that one.

93
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,480
So that's just how the probab, the Poisson
probability.

94
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,420
Distribution works.

95
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,590
Just like for the binomial probability
distribution, I can talk about

96
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,340
the probability of a specific outcome, the
specific number of counts.

97
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,700
And, that's what we are going to be
taking.

98
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,140
We are going to take those Poisson
probabilities, we are going to using those

99
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,190
in the likelihood function rather than the
binomial probabilities.
