2
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:08,880
In this next module, I'm going to talk
about the chi-squared test.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,180
This should be review, for everybody in
this course.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,170
So, I'm going to just go over this
quickly.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,600
And say a little bit about what the
chi-squared distribution actually is.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,090
And then, I'll just do one practice
problem on the chi squared.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,020
So the chi squared test is used when you
have either a two by two table or

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,130
something bigger than a 2x2 table, a
bigger contingency table.

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,620
And it's used when you have independent
observations.

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,750
But what is a chi-squared distribution?

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,810
I've mentioned the chi-squared
distribution a couple of times already

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,870
this week.

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,990
So, let me just say a little bit about
what it actually that distribution

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,850
actually is.

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,530
So, I mentioned earlier that a chi-square
with one degree of

16
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,460
freedom is simply equal to a standard
normal distribution squared.

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,690
Well what exactly do I mean by that?

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,430
One is equivilant to the other.

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,830
Well here's the idea, take a z
distribution,

20
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,280
that's just a standard normal distribution
that has a mean of zero and

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,380
a standard deviation of one and it's on a
bell curve.

22
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,710
Okay so that's a z distribution.

23
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,440
If you take a standard normal distribution
and you square all of the values, so for

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,300
example if you're at a value of two.

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,190
And, here's a z of two.

26
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,640
That would suddenly become a value of
four.

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,430
That would go to four.

28
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,310
And, if you're at a value of negative two,
that would also go to a value of four.

29
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,760
But, you keep the probability.

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,910
So the, the probability of getting
negative two or

31
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,100
positive two, is still the same.

32
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,389
But, we're squaring all the values in this
standard.

33
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,100
If you do that, what you end up with, is
you get rid of the negatives.

34
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,490
So a Chi-Squared distribution, it has a
bound at zero,

35
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,700
you can't have any negatives because it's
a squared thing.

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,910
But you end up with a bounded zero, and
then you end up with a long tail to

37
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,100
the right, and I'm not drawing this
totally to scale, it's got to be centered.

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,700
In this case, the mean is going to be one.

39
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,050
So if, if we just square the standard
normals, you'll end up with a mean of one,

40
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,710
and you're going to have a whole bunch of
things out in the tail,

41
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,240
because the twos become fours, the
negative two becomes four.

42
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,910
You're going to end up with a longer tail
here.

43
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,860
But mathematically, the probability of any
given set of val-,

44
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,030
given values is the same, it's just one is
the square of the other.

45
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,090
Now, that is a chi-squared with one degree
of freedom, so

46
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,210
that has a direct relation to ship to a
standard normal.

47
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,660
And it gets a little more tricky after
that.

48
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,240
But if you take one z squared and

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,870
you add it to another z squared you get a
chi-squared with two degrees of freedom.

50
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,450
So that's what a chi-squared with two
degrees of freedom is,

51
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,320
it's a standard normal squared plus a
standard normal squared.

52
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,140
You can see where I'm going with this.

53
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,500
If you then take a z squared plus a z
squared plus another z squared,

54
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,070
That ends up being a chi square with three
degrees of freedom, and so on.

55
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,820
And all of these of course have different
shapes.

56
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,710
And you can see some of the shapes here.

57
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,080
Which shows you with one degree of
freedom, two degrees, three degrees, etc.

58
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,710
in this little picture.

59
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,080
So, the shape of the distribution depends
on the degrees of freedom, but

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,800
there is a strict relationship back to the
standard normal.

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,730
And at least with a chi-squared of one,
degree of freedom,

62
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,140
that relationship is pretty direct.

63
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,129
This gets a little more tricky as you go
out, but there's this direct relationship.

64
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,430
Now it's useful to know that the expected
value of

65
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,460
a Chi-Square is always equal to its
degrees of freedom.

66
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,440
So the expected value of a Chi-Square of
one degree of freedom is one,

67
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,520
two degrees of freedom is two, etc.

68
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,830
And also the variance of a Chi-Square is
also,

69
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,500
is always equal to two times its degrees
of freedom.

70
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,740
So sometimes if you don't want to bother
to go look up chi-square.

71
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,650
The chi-square, you know the p value in a
chi-squared chart, you can kind of quickly

72
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,375
look at the value of the chi-squared in,
guessed, based on, you know

73
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:34,250
two times the degrees of freedom, and, you
know how you can probably guess whether or

74
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,670
not that chi-squared likely statistically
significant, you can make an estimate.

75
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,390
So it's useful to just keep that in mind
the expected value and variance grow.

76
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,360
With the numbers of degrees of freedom.

77
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,868
And again I'll just remind you that when
you're calculated degrees of freedom for

78
00:03:48,868 --> 00:03:52,510
a contingency table, is always the number
of

79
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,080
degrees of freedoms is equal to rows minus
one times columns minus one, so

80
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,210
since we're talking about the Chi-Squared
distribution can be applied to

81
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,510
many different things And it's not just
contingency tables.

82
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,170
But the, the co, one of the common uses of
a chi square is for contingencies tables.

83
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,620
In the case of contingency table the
degrees of freedom is always equal to r

84
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,480
minus, the rose minus one times the
columns minus one.

85
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,070
I'm just going to quickly walk through one
chi square test of

86
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,290
independance from my contingency table.

87
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,110
Again I'm assuming that you've all done
this before to the to be

88
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,800
pretty much reviewed.

89
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,460
So here's some data that I got out of
Agresti's discreet data analysis book.

90
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,450
They were looking at political ideology
and happiness.

91
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,420
So they do a big survey of people and

92
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,080
said you know, are you liberal, moderate
or conservative?

93
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,500
And what's your level of happiness?

94
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,320
We have two categorical variables they've
done this as they,

95
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,620
they could have scored this as continues
variables, probably but this

96
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,680
they've done this as categorical variables
but we have three level categories so

97
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,870
we don't, we no longer on a 2 by 2 table,
we're on a 3 by 3 table.

98
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,020
How can I tell, whether or not there are
significant differences

99
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,350
in happiness between the different
political ideology proofs.

100
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,790
I'm going to apply a chi-squared test for
that, so

101
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,000
when I've got a bigger contingency table I
going to apply the Chi-squared test.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,020
So now I'm actually going to apply that
Chi-squared test here.

103
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,488
So here is my Observe table just copied
from the last slide and

104
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:19,460
now I'm going to calculate the expected
values.

105
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,710
So we already did this for a two by two
table in an earlier module.

106
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,070
It's really the same idea here, but how do
I calculate my expected values?

107
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,060
So for, the quick way to calculate the
expected count for

108
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,030
any cell is to multiply the row total
times to column total for

109
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,110
that cell, and divide that by the total
end.

110
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,000
Again, why is that?

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,030
Because you have the no hypothesis is true
if the,

112
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,280
two things, political bent and happiness
are independent, then.

113
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,100
The probability of being in the in

114
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,620
any given cell should be the product of
the marginal probability so for

115
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,060
example the probability of being liberal
and not to happy will be.

116
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,610
Being that in this particular cell,

117
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,190
if those things are independent should be
exactly equal to the probability,

118
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,790
the marginal probability of being liberal,
the overall probability of

119
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,290
being liberal times the overall
probability of being not too happy.

120
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,170
So you would calculate that by doing 57
out of 321,

121
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,990
is your probability of being liberal.

122
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,920
Your marginal probability of being
liberal.

123
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,770
50 out of the 321 is your marginal
probability of being not too happy.

124
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,180
That's going to give you the probability
of being in this cell.

125
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,050
We always want to get counts for pi
squared so

126
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,540
we were then going to have to multiply
that by n.

127
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,210
Notice those 321's cancel, so

128
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,670
you can always get the expected value by
row total times column total divided by n.

129
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,890
So if I do that here, 57.

130
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,040
Times 50 divided by 321.

131
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,700
I get that the expected count here is
8.88.

132
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,290
So we were expecting only eight and

133
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,010
actually we saw a few more not too happy
people in the liberal category.

134
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,280
Alright, so next I'm going to go on and

135
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,940
I'm going to do the expected value for,
liberal and pretty happy.

136
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,530
I could pick any, any cell to do next, but
I'm just kind of go in, in order here.

137
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,380
So, how am I going to get that one?

138
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,060
I'm going to take the row total which is
57 times the column total which is 155 and

139
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,850
I'm going to divide that by the end, which
is 321.

140
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,610
Which gives me a value of 27.5.

141
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,450
Next I'm going to go ahead and

142
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,270
do the expected value in the Moderate and
Not too happy category.

143
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:25,700
So here I'm going to be using the row
total of 129 times the column total of 50,

144
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,800
divided by 321.

145
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,590
That gives me an expected value of 20.09.

146
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,670
And then I'm going to do this middle cell.

147
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,940
That's going to be 129 times Times 50
divided by 321.

148
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,010
And that gives me 62.29.

149
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,530
Now I could keep on multiplying like this.

150
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,280
But in fact,

151
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,950
there's an easier way from here on out to
solve the rest of the cells.

152
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,310
So what you have to recognize in a Chi
squared is that the marginals are fixed.

153
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,900
So 50, 155, and 116 those marginal totals.

154
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,680
And 57, 129, and 35, those don't change.

155
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,440
Those cannot change.

156
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,600
So by the time I've solved two cells in
the first row and

157
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,550
I know the total then I know what that
third cell in the first row has to be.

158
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,940
So I no longer have to do any
mulitplication.

159
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,680
And same way that you can see that
everyone of

160
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,990
the cells that's locked into this table I
can fill in simply by subtracting.

161
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,280
What this tells you, is that this table
has four degrees of freedom.

162
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,860
By the time I fill in four cells, the rest
of the cells are fixed.

163
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,760
So, it only has four degrees of freedom.

164
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,590
What that means in terms of my workload is
I only have to multiply out this

165
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,690
to get these expected values for four
cells and

166
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,450
then I am essentially done and I can just
subtract.

167
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,348
Another way to know that this has
[INAUDIBLE] is to do three rows and

168
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:42,180
three columns.

169
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,268
Three minus times three minus one is also
four.

170
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:45,910
But you can see that where that.

171
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,820
Comes from is that by the time I filled in
four cells, then I got one row left and

172
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,970
one column left, those are going to be
fixed, because the marginals are fixed.

173
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,460
So there's no more wiggle room.

174
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,940
There's no more degrees of freedom.

175
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,440
I'm just going to subtract, you know,

176
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,880
57 minus 27.5 minus 8.88 gives me an
expected value of 20.6 here.

177
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,320
And I'm subtracting to fill in the rest of
these cells.

178
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,900
So again, 50 minus 20.09 minus 8.88 gives
me 21.0.

179
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,260
So I am filling all of my expected values,
once I do that, then I can calculate.

180
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,330
Now here's just a little side that reviews
how to calculate the expected in case you

181
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,360
need a little refresher on that.

182
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,850
I'm going to just skip over that quickly.

183
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,560
You can pause it if you need to look at
that more carefully.

184
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,550
But now, once I've got my observed and

185
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,020
expected tables, I can calculate my
chi-squared statistics.

186
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,160
It's again a Chi score of 40 degrees of
freedom here.

187
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,990
My observe, the statistic is observe minus
expected squared divided by expected.

188
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,640
So I went ahead just to save us time here
and I plug in each of the values.

189
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,760
So the first cell the observed value was
13 the expected was 8.88.

190
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,760
The next cell the observed was 29 the
expected value was 27.5 and so on.

191
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,580
So there were nine cells on the table,

192
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,970
there are nine Terms is calculating this
chi-squared statistic.

193
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,810
Now, I have to admit that I actually
didn't want to sit there and

194
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,730
have to plug all of this into a
calculator, so I went ahead and

195
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,200
dumped all of these data into SAS, and
actually let SAS calculate this for me.

196
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,980
You're not going to have to do too many
chi-squares by hand, maybe one.

197
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,760
In this class, and then it's rather
tedious, you can see,

198
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,820
to calculate it by hand.

199
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,500
The computer can do it for you.

200
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,182
So when I calculate it out I

201
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:23,592
get a chi-squared value of seven point
zero seven.

202
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:25,550
This chi-squared has four degrees of
values of freedoms.

203
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,720
Remember the expected value here is four.

204
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,960
The variance is two times four or eight.

205
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,120
So you can see that seven isn't quite
enough bigger than four to

206
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,550
quite make statistical significance.

207
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,110
It's the p value here comes out to zero
point one three,

208
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,450
again you can go to a chart or you can
have sas or

209
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,030
another statistical program calculate that
for you directly which is what I did.

210
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,330
So it didn't quite reach statistical
significance.

211
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,330
We don't have enough evidence to say that,
you know,

212
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,340
liberals are doing worse on happiness
than, than conservatives.

213
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,780
But as your general setup for

214
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,370
the chi-squared test, you won't have to do
too many of these by hand.

215
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,990
You usually can let the computer do it but

216
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,300
it's good to kind of know what goes on
behind the scenes in calculating this.

217
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,190
Now, I'm just going to show you that if
you wanted to calculate that chi-squared

218
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,860
value by hand and then go get the p value
that corresponds out of it, you can go to

219
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,780
a chi-squared chart like that you can find
in back of an old fashioned text book.

220
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,260
Or, you can go to one of these online
calculators,

221
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,450
if you Google, chi-square P value
calculator, you'll get a ton.

222
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,760
Here's one that I used to get my P value.

223
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,980
Again, I also used SAS, but I plugged in
my chi-square seven point zero seven,

224
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,140
I plugged in the degrees of freedom.

225
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,364
It spits out for me, the two-sided P value
is zero point one three.

226
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:34,759
So fairly easy to do this online without
having to go to a chart.

227
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,321
