1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:07,180
This presentation is about respiratory
viruses, and the specific objectives are,

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:13,190
to focus on Respiratory Syncytial Virus,
RSV, and Metapneumovirus.

3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,260
Describing briefly their epidemiology, key
clinical manifestations and potential

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:24,720
complications, and how to manage these
particular respiratory viral infections.

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,250
So RSV is an extraordinarily important
virus.

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,160
For pediatricians and physicians who take
care of children.

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,780
It is one of the most important viral
pathogens during the first year of life.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,300
It's a member of the Paramyxovirus family
of viruses and

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,980
there's only a single serotype of RSV.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,510
There are two subtypes, A and B.

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,320
But a single serotype.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,360
These viruses are relatively labile so
when transporting from

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,170
the patient to the laboratory, for example
trying to grow the virus and

14
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,070
tissue culture, the specimens need to be
handled with care.

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,340
The virus may be isolated in tissue
culture.

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,380
And after incubating on the tissue culture
for.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:10,540
For three to seven days, they form
distinctive syn, syncytia in cell culture.

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,540
The CB cytopathogenic effect, shows
syncytia hence the name of the virus.

19
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,600
There are rapid techniques available for

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,060
diagnosing RSV, imunoflorescence for
example.

21
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,900
And these rapid techniques tend to be even
more sensitive than cultures, again,

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,090
because the virus.

23
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,140
Is, fickle.

24
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,980
This virus and tissue culture does not
agglutinate red blood cells in

25
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,780
contradistinction to the parainfluenza
virus.

26
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,600
And the virus has two very important
surface proteins, F which stands for

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,110
the fusion protein and G which stands for
the attachment protein.

28
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:50,880
This schematic of RSV demonstrates the
viral structure showing in the core,

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,810
the RNA of the virus.

30
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,810
The lipid membrane is illustrated on this
picture and the different surface proteins

31
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:05,530
that I've mentioned are also indicated on
this schematic picture of RSV.

32
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,630
The types of illnesses caused by RSV occur
during the winter and

33
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,620
spring in North America.

34
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,010
And the peak age of infection is between
two and

35
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,100
five months, the infections start at about
two months,

36
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,350
because antibody transferred from the
mother across the placenta.

37
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,840
Begins fading at about two months, and the
baby then becomes susceptible to

38
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,770
the RSV infection because there is no more
maternal antibody.

39
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,210
About 70% of the population is infected by
their first birthday, and

40
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,340
the remaining are infected by their fourth
birthday.

41
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,440
Viral shedding may occur for several weeks
in very young and sick infants.

42
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,520
So the babies may be infectious for a long
period of time.

43
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,110
Viral infections transmitted by droplets,
but

44
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,230
also could be transmitted on fomites and
infections occurring within

45
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,800
closed environments like hospitals,
nosocomial infections.

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,480
Are common and they may result in severe
disease.

47
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,790
The main patho, the contributors to the
pathogens of RSV infection include

48
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,470
transmission of a virus from cell to cell
down the respiratory tract.

49
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,630
And as the virus moves there is
substantial epithelial necrosis with

50
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,610
outpouring of cellular debris and mucus
that can result in airway plugging,

51
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,990
especially the small terminal airways, and
that plugging can result in air trapping.

52
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,590
Air comes in during inspiration and can't
get out as the airways collapse during

53
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,610
expiration, aggravated by the mucus and
cellular debris.

54
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,010
There's also a robust inflammatory
response that the host raises to

55
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,040
this virus, with lots of cytokine release
and other mediators, and

56
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,730
this can result, in these [UNKNOWN]
dilatation and

57
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:03,070
constriction of the respiratory muscles
around the terminal bronchials, ultimately

58
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,360
impeded gas exchange exchange hypoxia and
sometimes the need for ventilation.

59
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,220
Bronchiolitis is the term used to
describe,

60
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,910
RSV infection or infection of the terminal
bronchials.

61
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,409
Other viruses can cause bronchiolitis, but
RSV is by far the most prominent member.

62
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,430
bronchiolitis.

63
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,860
Because it involves small airway disease,

64
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,130
these babies are often referred to as
little wheezers.

65
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,120
They sound just like an asthmatic
individual.

66
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,239
But, they're very young and the process
has been stimulated by a virus.

67
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,960
They may get lung involvement, parenchymal
involvement,

68
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,000
in addition to airway involvement.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,080
So you can actually have a bronchial
pneumonia associated with RSV.

70
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,170
RSV infections in little people is a very
common reason for

71
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,030
emergency room visits and for hospital
admissions.

72
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,250
During the peek season.

73
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,510
There also may be some long term
complications to

74
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,550
RSV infection early in life.

75
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,270
There's some, thought that RSV may
stimulate the subsequent development of

76
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,210
asthma, but it's a bit of a chicken and
egg argument.

77
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,660
It may be that children prone to asthma
have bad RSV infections as opposed to

78
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,020
the bad RSV infection actually causing the
asthma.

79
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,270
Because immunity is not perfect after an
RSV infection,

80
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,950
reinfections may occur later in life.

81
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,050
But these reinfections tend to be mild as
I

82
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,610
said with upper respiratory tract kind of
illnesses.

83
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,550
And so the clinical manifestations of
broncialitis.

84
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,290
After an incubation period of four to six
days the child begins to

85
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,400
have upper repository type symptoms.

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,230
A stuffy nose a runny nose perhaps a
little bit of a cough.

87
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,230
And then there is variable progression of
the illness over a period of one to

88
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,450
seven days.

89
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,290
A variable, variable progression meaning
some.

90
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:01,290
Progressed that more severe disease,
others actually, begin getting better.

91
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,300
Fever is quite common with RSV infection
and

92
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,650
it does not imply that there's a secondary
super infection.

93
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,920
it may simply be a result of the virus
itself.

94
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,650
As the virus causes problems in the lower
respiratory tract,

95
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,510
there maybe begins breathing more quickly.

96
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,650
grunting, which is a way to exert positive
airway pressure and to try to

97
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:28,380
keep the airways open, nasal flaring,
retractions of the intercostal muscles.

98
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,720
Wheezing and the baby may become blue as
they become hypoxy, hypoxic.

99
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,870
Apnea may be a manifestation of RSV as
well,

100
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,910
even if there's not severe lower
respiratory tract involvement.

101
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,030
The apnea may be centrally mediated, that
is, through the immature brain,

102
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,920
hence it's a bit more common in babies who
have been born prematurely.

103
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:56,420
Some patients, will have predictably more
severe disease than other patients.

104
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,620
specifically, extremes of age.

105
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,230
So babies who contract RSV in the first
six weeks of life,

106
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,990
which is not as common, as two to five
months of age.

107
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,550
But if they do, they tend to have more
severe disease,

108
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,200
probably because their airways, are
already quite small.

109
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,710
The elderly also may have severe RSV
infection,

110
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,240
probably because of waning immunity.

111
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,370
Children, who have congenital heart
disease,

112
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,290
especially congenital heart disease,
associated with cyanosis,

113
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:29,670
tend to have more severe RSV infection, as
do children with chronic lung disease.

114
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,160
Such as those with bronchopulmonary
dysplasia, or BPD.

115
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,720
Which is a consequence of severe
prematurity.

116
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,820
Otherwise, compromised children, such as
transplant recipients or

117
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:47,050
children with cancer getting chemotherapy,
may have bad outcomes with RSV infection,

118
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,270
and those who are neurologically impaired
may have bad outcomes with RSV.

119
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,350
The treatment and

120
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,520
prevention of RSV infection has fueled
many debates over time.

121
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,030
so, for example, for a while, it was
popular to have babies with RSV inhale

122
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,310
epinephrine and cause vasoconstriction and
try to reduce some of the inflammation.

123
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,630
This is not generally recommended.

124
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,390
There's a worry that the baby may get even
more

125
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,280
worse after the epinephrine has stopped
with rebound.

126
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,260
So it's really not recommended.

127
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,690
Bronchodilators are tried by, many.

128
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,190
If they actually seem to cause some
relief,

129
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,050
then it's recommended that they may be
continued while a child's hospitalized.

130
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,980
If they don't work, they shouldn't be
used.

131
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,990
Steroids have had inconsistent results and
are not recommended.

132
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,290
The antiviral agent Ribavirin, which is
active against RSV and some other virus,

133
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,170
has really had inconsistent results in
terms of substantial benefit.

134
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,940
It costs a lot of money, it's difficult to
administer, and is not widely used.

135
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,590
Immunization would be great if you had a
licensed vaccine but we do not.

136
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,460
and one of the original vaccines cause
more severe illness in

137
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,790
the recipients than the natural disease
itself which is not a good thing.

138
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:13,120
A passive antibody is effective in helping
to prevent and ameliorate RSV infection

139
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,120
and in the high risk host that I mentioned
previously giving passive antibody.

140
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,060
Through the first, and or second year of
life to try and prevent RSV is used.

141
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,310
The passive antibody is either given
intravenously, or

142
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,480
now more commonly intramuscularly at,.

143
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,130
Monthly intervals during the, RSV season.

144
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,760
And, of course, supportive care can never
be argued with.

145
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,160
If the child is hypoxic, for example, they
should receive oxygen.

146
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,850
A metapneumovirus is more or less like
RSV.

147
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,770
It's an RSV look alike.

148
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,650
It is a member of the paramyxovirus.

149
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,870
Family.
It also has one serotype.

150
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:56,110
It doesn't grow in tissue culture as well
as RSV, but it can be diagnosed with PCR.

151
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,910
And its clinical illness, although less
common, is virtually identical or

152
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,170
can be virtually identical to RSV.

153
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,790
And this final slide simply [INAUDIBLE].

154
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:12,290
It, depicts the key features of RSV and
Metapneumovirus in a summary table.

155
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,969
