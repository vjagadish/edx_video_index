00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,620
Hi, my name is Sharon Chen and I'm from
Stanford University.

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,880
This video is on entry.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,410
How microbes enter the host.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,460
And as part of our Introduction to
Microbiology module.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,340
From the point of view of a microbe,

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,530
the first step of causing infection is to
gain entry into the host.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,270
In this video,

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,660
we will discuss the common entry portals
that microbes use to infect humans.

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,800
For physicians, it is important to
understand where the infection began.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,610
How a microbe enters the host can help
with diagnosis.

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,460
And prevention of infection transmission.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,140
The learning objectives are to recognize
the portals of entry that microbes use to

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,590
enter the host and

14
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,240
to describe some ways that microbes gain
access to the entry portals of the host.

15
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,850
Microbes enter hosts through many
different portals.

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,400
Any break in the skin apatheia layer is an
entry portal.

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,130
Skin can be disrupted through trauma
including a scape on a knee,

18
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,830
surgical incisions and bites from animals
or vectors like mosquitos.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,880
Mucosa including conjunctiva, nares,
oropharynx, vagina, and

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,640
rectum are also entry portals.

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,980
Some entry portals are specialized.

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,070
For example, the umbilical cord and
umbilicus are important portals for

23
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,210
the fetus in neonate.

24
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,770
In order for microbes to enter the via
portals,

25
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,010
the microbes must gain access to these
entry portals.

26
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,380
Access to entry is determined by host
behaviors, motility of the microbe and

27
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,919
sensing cues, among others.

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,650
Several examples of host behaviors allow
access to entry portals.

29
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,600
What we eat and drink is an important
determinant.

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,530
For example, drinking contaminated water
can lead to

31
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,960
cholera resulting in profuse watery
diarrhea.

32
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,200
People who don't wash hands properly and
touch their eyes, nose, or

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,680
mouth allow potential entry of influenza
virus and other respiratory viruses.

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,700
Unprotected sexual intercourse allows
potential entry of HIV or

35
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,590
Treponema pallidum, the bacteria that
causes syphilis.

36
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,120
Even scratching a bug bite could allow
potential entry of microbes.

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,531
Chagas disease is caused by a protozoa
called [UNKNOWN].

38
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:29,640
Trypanosomes in the feces of the reduviid
bug, can access through breaks in

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,970
the skin from a person scratching the
intensely peridic bite.

40
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:38,735
Microbes can also gain access to entry
portals by swimming or crawling.

41
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:42,170
Free-living organisms, such as round
worms, use this strategy.

42
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,610
Vectors gain access to hosts by using
sensing cues.

43
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,430
Production of carbon dioxide is a common
strategy used by

44
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,100
mosquitoes which can transmit Plasmodium,
the protozoa that causes malaria.

45
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,670
And it's also used by ticks which can
transmit Borrelia burgdorferi,

46
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,949
the bacteria that causes lyme disease.

47
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,160
Vectors can also use temperature,
vibration, shadows, and

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,480
colors as sensing cues.

49
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,489
