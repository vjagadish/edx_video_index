[MUSIC]

2
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:26,535
>> Welcome back.

3
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:27,510
I'm Dr.Larry Chu.

4
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,380
>> And I'm Dr.Ren Weidman.

5
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,980
>> And in this segment, we're going to
talk about the pre-operative assessment of

6
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,620
patients undergoing cardiac surgery, as
well as some consent issues.

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,730
So Ren, tell me a little bit about what
you're going to cover in the lecture.

8
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,860
What are some important points that our
learners need to know when

9
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,830
they're thinking about performing a
pre-operative assessment and

10
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,810
consenting patients for a cardiac surgery
and cardiac anesthesia.

11
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,840
>> Okay, so the cardiac surgical patient
usually has a very thorough workup.

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,510
In just a little bit, we'll talk about
[COUGH] looking at some of

13
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,930
the extra tests to assess the cardiac
function in preparations for surgery.

14
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,780
We'll also discuss how to help them
prepare mentally and emotionally for

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,570
a very big procedure and, and get them
through the consent process as well.

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,720
>> Great.
Well, it sounds like there are some very

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,300
specialized things we need to know, so
let's go learn about them right now.

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,110
>> Okay.
Hi, this is Ren Weidman.

19
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,850
We're going to talk a little bit about the
Preoperative Evaluation and

20
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,750
Consent in preparation for cardiac
surgery.

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:31,060
So most cardiac surgery patients are very
well worked up.

22
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,670
Many of the elements, in fact, almost all
of the elements that we

23
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,230
apply to a regular work-up still apply to
patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

24
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,890
You're going to want to make sure you
access the airway

25
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,760
review allergies review pertinent medical
history, medications.

26
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,460
In addition, there are certain elements
which are specific to cardiac surgery

27
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,189
which should be reviewed and considered in
the pre-operative evaluation.

28
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,790
So we'll go through it by systems, and
just touch on the systems for which the,

29
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,710
the pre-operative work is different or in
which there are additional elements in

30
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,010
the cardiac surgical patient relative to
the non-cardiac surgical patient.

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,730
So first, we'll talk about the, the
obvious.

32
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,919
The cardiovascular exam.

33
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,050
So what you're going to want to do is,

34
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:22,220
is be sure you get a good history of the
patient's cardiac cardiac history.

35
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,410
Try to understand what the symptoms are,

36
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,180
when the onset was and what the patient's
pathway to surgery was.

37
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,490
How did they get from their symptoms to
being evaluated for cardiac surgery?

38
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,770
Try to flush out any prior cardiac
intervention, inter,

39
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,020
intervention's the patient may have had.

40
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,870
This includes surgeries, any stents any
pacers or AICDs.

41
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,190
And if the patient had a pacer, has a
pacer or

42
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,990
any AICD get an understanding for what the
indication was.

43
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,700
If the patient is pacer dependent or not
pacer dependent.

44
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,720
Who the manufacturer of the pacer or

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,860
the AICD was and when the pacer was last
interrogated.

46
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,560
This will help to make decisions during
the day of surgery about the management of

47
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,030
the pacer.

48
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,030
All patients coming in for a cardiac
surgery will have

49
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,910
had an echocardiogram done prior to the
day of surgery.

50
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,490
When you're reviewing the at, the report
from the echocardiogram make sure you

51
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,300
look for a left and right ventricular
function.

52
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,280
Focus on any Valvular lesions and their
severity, and

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,210
especially pay attention to those that are
moderate or severe in nature.

54
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,830
If you're doing a surgery or the patient's
scheduled for surgery targeting a valve.

55
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,400
Try to note that the pressure gradients
across that value.

56
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,270
For example, if, if the patient is
undergoing an aortic value replacement for

57
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:50,790
a stenosis get a sense for how severe the
pressure gradients are across that value.

58
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,260
And finally, take a look at the RVSP or
the PASP.

59
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,400
Recordings that are estimated by
echocardiography.

60
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,940
These are usually found in the assessment
of the tricuspid valve on the report.

61
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,840
As the, these estimates are used from

62
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,990
Doppler across the tricuspid regurgitation
gen.

63
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,049
This can help you to understand how the RV
functions, and also.

64
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,490
With the pulmonary vascular, vascular
[UNKNOWN] is, is like in your patient.

65
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,120
You also want to look for

66
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,420
anything that might be out of the ordinary
in the report.

67
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,148
A Thrombus mentioned, a PFO mentioned.

68
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:33,878
Something unique that, that you might not
expect.

69
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:37,312
Moving on to CATH, a vast majority of
patients will have some sort of

70
00:04:37,312 --> 00:04:40,129
cardiac catheterization prior to surgery.

71
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:44,291
You want to look for significant lesions
and, and significant lesions

72
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:48,725
are technically considered, any lesion
that is greater than seventy percent.

73
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:53,939
Though I would say keep track of any
lesion that was greater than 50% even

74
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:58,840
though it has to be greater than 70% to be
considered obstructive.

75
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:06,800
Also try to remember the location or take
note of the location of the lesion.

76
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,590
Sometimes during catheterization there
will also be assessments of

77
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,690
the right heart pressures more directly
than those that are recorded on the echo.

78
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,210
And if that occurs they're usually done
for a reason, so

79
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,650
it's a good idea to to be aware of them
for that.

80
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,700
And finally, looking at the dominance,
whether it's left, right, or co-dominant,

81
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,920
can be, can be helpful in sort of avoiding
some of the pitfalls during surgery.

82
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,910
So Carotid Dopplers are not always
performed, but sometimes they are.

83
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,660
And when they are, they can significant
can, can affect things.

84
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,840
It can change the surgical plan, for
example, the surgeon might decide to add

85
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,180
a corrodid and direct the day of the
surgery in addition to the heart surgery.

86
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,580
Also, if there is significant carotid
disease in an attempt to maintain

87
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,300
adequate perfusion to the brain in
cardiopulmonary

88
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,580
bypass the perfusionist might decide to
target a perfusion pressure which is

89
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,589
higher than normal during the bypass
period if the patient has carotid disease.

90
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:16,280
So moving on let's next talk about some of
the, some of the things that we should pay

91
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,190
specific attention to in the neurologic
system.

92
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,670
So cardiac surgery, more so than other
surgeries, carries a,

93
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,750
a pretty significant risk of stroke.

94
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,510
For this reason, it's important to
establish a baseline in the patient so

95
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,460
that any, any observed neurologic deficits
in the post-operative period can be

96
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,610
compared to those assessed in the
pre-operative period and

97
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,110
be determined to be new, or, or just the
patient's baseline.

98
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,300
Moving on to the gastrointestinal system.

99
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,060
Quite common to cardiac surgery is the use
of a transesophageal echocardiogram.

100
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,620
A TEE adds the risk of esophageal injury.

101
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,210
It can happen in anyone, but

102
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,670
it is much more likely to in patients who
have preexisting esophageal disease.

103
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,170
So it's important to ask about existing
pathology.

104
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,450
Including Zenker's, diverticulum, any
stricture, any history of dilation,

105
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,510
any history of masses.

106
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,110
In addition to asking about already
diagnosed pathology,

107
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:24,900
symptoms should be reviewed to see if a
patient has any concerning symptoms for

108
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,680
esophageal pathology that might not yet
have been diagnosed.

109
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,530
And this includes, you know, problems
swallowing,

110
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,510
sensation of food getting stuck or
regurgitated food during eating.

111
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,970
And if the patient has one of these, one
of these conditions and, and

112
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,800
you're concerned about it, it's important
to talk to your attending early.

113
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:51,040
What you might want to do is, is, schedule
an EGD so you can look and, and,

114
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,100
and make sure that there is nothing that
is to problematic or

115
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,636
is nothing that would prevent you from
using a TEE.

116
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:04,427
again, it's best in this early as, as
nobody likes to be call last minute on

117
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:11,580
the day of surgery to do an emergency EED
before heart surgery.

118
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,590
Continuing on to medications.

119
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,670
As always, getting an accurate list of
medications is important, but

120
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:21,260
pay specific attention to medications
which are used for the cardiac systems,

121
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:28,410
includes beta blockers, ACE inhibitors,
calcium channel blockers, Statin's.

122
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,930
Also you want to look to, to see about any
anticoagulation medications.

123
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,510
Or any anti-platelet medications that the
patient might be on.

124
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,870
And with regards to the anticoagulants and

125
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,229
the anti-platelets pay attention to when
these were stopped if they were stopped.

126
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,225
finally, it's good to know when the
patient last took their beta

127
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:55,710
blocker; as usually, beta blockers are
continued, even on the morning of surgery.

128
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,270
So after reviewing the,

129
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,980
the preoperative history of the patient,
it's time to talk about the consent.

130
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:07,000
Consent for cardiac surgery contains the
normal elements that one might consent

131
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,380
a patient for for any anesthesia.

132
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,800
In addition you're going to want to review
the consent process for Arterial lines,

133
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,550
Central lines, TEE and the possibility of
a prolonged intubation or an ICU stay.

134
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,260
For an arterial line have the patient
understand that this will be

135
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,880
done awake but under local.

136
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,330
Anesthetic and probably with a little bit
of sedation on board.

137
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,680
The Central line on the TEE would be done
asleep.

138
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:35,090
Again, this is, this is the time that you
had mentioned to the patient that with

139
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:40,700
the TTE there's a very small risk of
esophageal injury, in a patient,

140
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,880
especially in a patient who has no prior
history of esophageal pathology.

141
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,510
And to clarify that, that we feel that the
information gleamed the benefit that we

142
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,900
gleamed from having a TEE definitely
outweighs the risk that

143
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,770
is imposed by introducing the prorogue
into the esophagus.

144
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,420
finally, when you're talking about the
post operative course prolonged intubation

145
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,660
is, is not uncommon, though it's, it's not
obviously what we aim for.

146
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,830
And this kind of brings us to
expectations.

147
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,280
So it's useful to go over the flow of the
day with patient, and

148
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,760
also with the patient's family, what they
can expect during,

149
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,670
the pre-operative visit, prior to going
back to the operating room.

150
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,110
With the pace you can expect in the
operating room prior to be,

151
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,320
to being put under anesthesia.

152
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,480
And then explaining to him or her, what
will happen to him after

153
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,500
he goes under anesthesia all the way to
the time that he gets to the ICU.

154
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,790
And then letting the family know that they
will get periodic updates or

155
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,870
on the surgical team during the operation,
they will be allowed to come, and, and

156
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,840
see their see their family member in the
ICU as soon as the patient gets there and

157
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,380
the nurses have had a chance to sort of
get things tucked in.

158
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,610
It's important, again to talk

159
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,850
about post-operative expectations that we
aim to extubate early.

160
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,200
But that we would much rather be
conservative and hold off,

161
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,090
hold off of extubation if, if we feel like
it's necessary.

162
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,740
We would much rather take a little longer
to extubate than extuate early, and

163
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,730
then have to reintabate.

164
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,140
And then address the patient's anxiety.

165
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,620
Again, anxiety is common in, in most
surgeries.

166
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,390
But especially in cardiac surgery anxiety
is, is quite prevalent.

167
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,800
Helping to address it and, and
acknowledging it is,

168
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,260
is a useful way of helping the patient to
feel more comfortable.

169
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,200
Let the patient know that anxiety is
normal.

170
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,260
That this is a big deal for them.

171
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,290
But for most, but that for most of the
patient,

172
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,330
most of the participants in the day
surgery, the anesthesiologist,

173
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,610
the perfusionist, the cardiac surgeons,
the nurses.

174
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,410
This is an everyday activity.

175
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,310
We see patients like, like this all the
time,.

176
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,210
And being aware of, of a patient's needs
usually helps them

177
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,200
to feel a little less anxious about
something that.

178
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,070
That is very normal to be just about.

179
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,710
So that's it.
Reviewing,

180
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:10,150
doing a thorough review of systems with
focus on specific elements which

181
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:15,930
might play into what one can expect on the
day of cardiac surgery is important.

182
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:20,849
And then adding some additional elements
that we discussed to

183
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:24,633
the consent process and helping the
patient and

184
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:29,552
the family members to know what to expect
the day of surgery and

185
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:36,100
during the time period immediately
following surgery, can be very beneficial.

186
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,680
Thank you for your time.

187
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,200
>> Well, that was a very interesting
lecture and very thorough.

188
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,840
Thank you.
I do have a couple questions, though.

189
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:45,340
You know, we don't always have the luxury
of having time to really

190
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,360
do a careful preoperative assessment and
consent in emergency situations.

191
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,160
So one of my questions is, in the really
emergent setting,

192
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,025
what are the essential points that I need
to know in terms of

193
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:02,310
pre-operative assessment of the patient
who's undergoing cardiac surgery.

194
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,090
>> That's a very good question.

195
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,170
Like with most emergencies,

196
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,580
one of the key elements is just to assess
the patient's airway.

197
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,200
You also want to know if your patient has
any allergies and if you

198
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,140
can get an idea for what medications he or
she is on, that can really be helpful.

199
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,580
In terms of emerging cardiac surgeries,

200
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,420
if you can get an understanding of the
left ventricular function,

201
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,680
how the heart is working in general, that
can be quite beneficial,

202
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,300
whether that's from the history from the
patient or going over old notes.

203
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,960
Or if your facility has the ability to do
a very quick TTE,

204
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,440
that can also definitely give you a good
idea for the heart function.

205
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,510
>> Wonderful.

206
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,440
Well, to summarize what we've learned in
this segment, the first thing is, for

207
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,770
a preoperative assessment, you really
start with the basics.

208
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,390
What you normally do for the preoperative
assessment of any patient undergoing

209
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:56,140
anesthesia, you want to get a careful
history of other comorbidities.

210
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,280
As well as the airway, as you mentioned,
but the difference is,

211
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,780
of course, with the cardiac patient that
you'll want to get a full evaluation of

212
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:09,110
cardiac function of lafrintricular
function, whether that is from

213
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:15,230
imaging studies like echnocartiography or
cath log studies, cathernization studies.

214
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,320
In addition, we want to really talk to the
patient.

215
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,800
Get a sense of the history of exercise
tolerance.

216
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,960
What can they do without getting short of
breath?

217
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,650
Do they have any angina or chest pain?

218
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,468
Those are of course the important factors
to to elicit from your patient.

219
00:14:31,468 --> 00:14:38,470
The other thing, of course, is to get a
history of esophageal disease because

220
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:44,120
we do procedures in cardiac anesthesia,
trans esophageal epicardiography that

221
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,010
may be contraindicated in patients with
that type of disease.

222
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,790
Of course, also consenting the patient.

223
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,810
For issues such as having extra lines when
they wake up so

224
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,660
they're expecting they may have an
arterial line, extra IVs,

225
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,350
a central line or they may be intibated
post-operatively in the ICU.

226
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:09,910
You also want to know if they've been on
any anticoagulation medications.

227
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,290
Because they do factor into our anesthetic
plan if the patient is on those type

228
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,680
of medications.

229
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,270
And finally, of course, consenting these
patients in general.

230
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,430
We need to understand that for

231
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,990
many patients it's a very anxious time in
their life.

232
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,650
Maybe the most anxious time in their life.

233
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:32,030
There is a perception of cardiac surgery
and these procedures being high risk.

234
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:36,630
And so we as Anesthesiologist need to help
reassure our patients.

235
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:41,590
And help them come prepared emotionally,
as well, for the Anesthetic plan and

236
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,010
for the surgical procedure.

237
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:44,920
Great.

238
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,240
Well, we'll see you next time.

239
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:57,240
