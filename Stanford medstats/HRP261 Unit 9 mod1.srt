[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,370
In this next module, I'm going to review
the concept of correlated data.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,560
I'm also going to introduce the two simple
example data sets that

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,870
I made up to illustrate the concepts this
week.

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:21,960
So first of all, how do you know if you
have correlated data?

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,990
The first step in determining that,

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,810
is that you have to figure out what is the
unit of observation?

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,988
Often-times that's obvious it's just a
person.

9
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:34,830
Oftentimes we're just doing studies on
individual people, but

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,170
that's not always the unit of observation.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,750
Some studies might be focused on limbs or
hands or knees or eyes.

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,880
Or, if you're doing a split phase trial in
dermatology, half a face, or

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,660
a whole clinical center rather than an
individual.

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,600
So you need to determine that first,

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,360
before you can figure it out if the
observations are correlated.

16
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,680
Then you're going to ask yourself,

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,160
are these observations independent or
correlated?

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,900
Independent observations are, of course,
unrelated.

19
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,105
Oftentimes, this is different, unrelated
people, but

20
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:07,860
again, that doesn't always have to be the
case.

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,630
Correlated observations have some
relationship to one another.

22
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,230
The most common source of correlation is
repeated measures data,

23
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,020
where you take the same person and measure
them over time.

24
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,710
Obviously since it's the same person at
multiple time points,

25
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,070
that person's going to be correlated with
themselves over time.

26
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,420
But you could doing a study also where
you're looking at two legs, or

27
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,150
two knees, or two eyes from the same
person.

28
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,750
Or you might be doing a matched case
control study, where each case and

29
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,760
control are one to one match to each
other, and therefore are correlated.

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,850
Now I just want to point out that this
week,

31
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,760
I'm going to be talking about methods for
analyzing cross-sectional correlated data,

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,530
so I'm not yet going to get into the
situation when we're dealing with

33
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,440
repeated measures, that is things over
time.

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,310
So if you want to learn about repeated
measures,

35
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,150
that's what's going to be covered in a lot
of detail in the spring

36
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,720
quarter course HRP262.

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,980
So it turns out that adding time to the
picture does complicate things, and

38
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,680
so well we'll get into that, we'll delve
into that in the spring.

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,850
For today we'll stick with cross-sectional
examples of correlation.

40
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,100
Now I told you before that there are two
possible consequences of

41
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,630
ignoring the correlations in, in your
data.

42
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,176
So if you're doing what are called
within-person or

43
00:02:21,176 --> 00:02:22,810
within-cluster comparisons, and

44
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,460
you ignore the correlations, you're going
to end up with p-values that are too big.

45
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,050
You're going to be overly conservative.

46
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,640
However, if you are doing between-person
or between-cluster comparisons and

47
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,920
you ignore the correlations, your p-values
are going to end up too small.

48
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,040
They're going to be too optimistic.

49
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,170
So I've, I've told you this before, but I
thought it might be helpful to actually

50
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,570
draw out a picture of this just to make
sure we're all clear on what I mean here.

51
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,444
So I'm just going to draw a picture of
some possible data.

52
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:54,200
[NOISE]
So the dots here represent observations,

53
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,340
and I'm going to color the different
clusters with different colors.

54
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,010
So here's some datas that are somehow
clustered,

55
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,898
there's somehow a relationship between the
points in these different circles.

56
00:03:05,898 --> 00:03:08,170
[BLANK_AUDIO]

57
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,550
So these, this could represent maybe
you've done a match case

58
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,320
control study where each case has been
matched to three controls, and

59
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,840
each of these circles might represent
different matched strata.

60
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,020
Or maybe you've done a family study where
these dots represent siblings from

61
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,270
different families.

62
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,780
Or maybe you're looking at some kind of
dermatology study and

63
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,400
these dots represent lesions from the same
person.

64
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,530
All of those are possible scenarios that
could generate data that look like this.

65
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,200
So when we talk about within cluster
comparisons, what we mean by that is,

66
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,250
imagine you have a case where different
observations, or different people,

67
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,690
if you have people, within a cluster, have
different exposures, or

68
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,810
different treatments.

69
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,470
They differ in some way.

70
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,260
So imagine you're doing a tree you know, a
randomized trial, and

71
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,930
some people within a cluster get the
treatment, and some people don't.

72
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,160
So it might look something like this.

73
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,000
This could be a treatment in a randomized
trial,

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,360
it could be different exposures in an
observational study.

75
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,360
If you want to do a within-cluster
comparison, what you're doing is,

76
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,550
you're comparing people who have the
predictor or exposure or

77
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,230
treatment of interest within a cluster to
other people in the same cluster who do

78
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,570
not have that exposure or predictor of
interest.

79
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,050
Because people within a cluster are
similar to one another, this helps to

80
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,330
reduce variability, noise, because you,
you're not worrying about some of the,

81
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,940
you know, some of the confounders are
going to be controlled for, for example.

82
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,620
You're only comparing people who are
similar, or

83
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,700
observations who are similar to one
another.

84
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,860
So you could do these within-cluster
comparisons.

85
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,660
And that looks like that, and of course
then, the statistics that we

86
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,140
use here are going to somehow aggregate
over all the different clusters,

87
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,010
these within-cluster comparisons.

88
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,470
So this would be things like your paired
t-test or your McNemar's test.

89
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,100
If you have data that look like this, and
you're doing some kind of

90
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,310
regression modeling, you can actually go
one step further.

91
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,799
So when we talk about GEE modelling, I'll
mention that you can both look at

92
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:09,623
within person comparison or within-cluster
comparisons, and between-person or

93
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:11,510
between cluster comparisons.

94
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,070
So in other words,

95
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,710
you could not only compare if you're doing
regression modelling, you could not

96
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,690
only compare within a cluster, but you
could also compare treated people to

97
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,440
untreated people, across different
clusters.

98
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,500
So that, it, it is possible to do both
between cluster and

99
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,410
within cluster comparisons in the same
data set, but

100
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,990
you have to be using some kind of
regression, like GEE Modelling.

101
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,080
We'll talk a lot about that in the spring
term.

102
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,860
But now for the moment imagine that you
have the following situation.

103
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,370
A little bit different set-up of your
data.

104
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,480
So imagine.

105
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,210
[BLANK_AUDIO]

106
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,000
You have, again, clustered data, but
different people, or

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,870
different observations within a cluster,

108
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,600
all have the same level of the predictor
that you are interested in.

109
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,180
So maybe it's a cluster randomized trial.

110
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,120
And clusters are randomized as a group to
a single treatment.

111
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,410
If you have this situation, where
everybody has the same exposures or

112
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,290
treatments within a cluster, then you
cannot do within cluster comparisons,

113
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,360
right, because everybody's at the same
level.

114
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,690
So the only thing you can do with these
data is to do between cluster comparisons.

115
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,370
You would compare people who got one
treatment,

116
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,580
to people who got a different treatment
across different clusters.

117
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,940
So that's the idea of between cluster
comparisons.

118
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,020
So if it helps you to kind of draw out
this picture that might help, you know,

119
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,770
to, you to kind of get this idea, and

120
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,020
I'll try to draw out pictures as we go
through this week.

121
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,860
So I made up two hypothetical data sets,
they're very simple.

122
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,120
But I think sometimes having a simple
example helps when you're starting to

123
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,800
learn a method, so we'll just, it's an
easy example to get your head around.

124
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,590
So the first made up data set,

125
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,720
the hype, is a hypothetical randomized
trial of some kind of eye-disease.

126
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,280
And the researchers here assigned 50
patients with bilateral eye-disease,

127
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,700
meaning that they have disease in both
eyes, to receive a drug in one eye, and

128
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,200
a placebo in the other eye.

129
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,880
And it's probably randomly assigned which
treatment, or

130
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,630
which eye, the treatment goes in, left or
right.

131
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,010
And let's say the outcome here is
something very simple.

132
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,840
And your, you have a success if the
symptoms in

133
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,760
the eye improve by more than 50%, and it's
a failure if they don't.

134
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,809
So it's a simple binary outcome.

135
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,260
Now clearly the unit of observation for
this data set has to be the eye, right?

136
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,380
It can't be a person, because each person
has

137
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,000
been given two different interventions, so
we have to look at unit of eye.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,610
And of course, these observations are
going to be correlated,

139
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,640
because eyes within a person are
correlated.

140
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,070
Now I made up some, you know, outcome data
here.

141
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,130
Again, these are hypothetical data, but to
illustrate a point.

142
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:51,030
And then I analyzed the data ignoring the
correlations, just to start with,

143
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,590
to show you what happens.

144
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,450
So I've ignored the correlations and
pretended,

145
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,360
in essence, that I've just got 50
drug-treated eyes and

146
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,960
50 placebo-treated eyes, and there's no
linking between them.

147
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,754
It's just like I have 100 independent
eyes.

148
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:08,200
I applied a Chi-square test here, and the
p-value came out to be 0.07.

149
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
So this would be the incorrect analysis,

150
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,750
because of course we are ignoring the
correlations now.

151
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,499
But notice the p-value comes out to be
0.07.

152
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:21,189
It turned out that there were 32
drug-treated eyes that improved versus 23

153
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:23,596
placebo-treated eyes that improved.

154
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:29,023
And if you just compared that 32 out of
50, the 64%, to the 23 out of 50, the 46%,

155
00:08:29,023 --> 00:08:33,847
with a Chi-squared, it doesn't quite come
out to be statistically significant.

156
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:37,213
But something not right here, because we
haven't accounted for

157
00:08:37,213 --> 00:08:41,910
the fact that, hey within a person the,
the eyes are related to one another.

158
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:46,090
Somebody who is likely to have a good
outcome in one eye is also likely to

159
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,150
have a good outcome in another.

160
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,290
And again by actually accounting for the
correlations, since there's going to

161
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,290
be a lot of variation across different
people, by only analysing within

162
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,050
a person we're reducing variation, we're
going to improve our p-value.

163
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,880
So you all know how to analyze these data
correctly, already.

164
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,080
We don't really need to do a regression
here.

165
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,230
I've already shown you that you could
apply McNemar's test.

166
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,890
So just a review, how does McNemar's test
work?

167
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,660
McNemar's test is just a b minus c
squared, divided by b plus c, b and

168
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,230
c are representing discordant cells.

169
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,220
So this is people where the one eye
improved, but

170
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,140
the other eye didn't improve.

171
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,150
And if the treatment works, we'd expect
that in most of those discordant cases it

172
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,170
would be the treated eye that improved and
not the placebo.

173
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,120
So we can just apply McNemar's formula
here.

174
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,930
It would be 13 minus four squared divided
by 17.

175
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:44,000
That will have a Chi-square distribution
with one degree of freedom.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,910
If you go and calculate that out and

177
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,330
look up the p-value, it turns out to be
that the p-value is .029.

178
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,750
So it actually gets smaller when you
correctly account for

179
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,680
the correlations here.

180
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,820
And just to put a little picture to this,
I can draw these little graphics again.

181
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,870
Now these dots actually represent eyes.

182
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,260
And what's happened here is we've treated
one eye, but not the other in a person,

183
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,170
and, of course, then we can do within
person comparisons of the eyes.

184
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,560
That's what McNemar's test does.

185
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,910
I then made up a second hypothetical data
set.

186
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,290
It's very similar to the first.

187
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:25,320
The only difference is, we again have 50
patients with bilateral eye disease, but

188
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,260
the difference here is that every patient
is going to receive either the drug or

189
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,020
the placebo in both eyes.

190
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,250
So the same thing is happening to both
eyes within a person.

191
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,830
So again, to draw my little picture.

192
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:42,580
[NOISE]

193
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,750
A single person receives the same thing in
both eyes.

194
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,130
And so, of course,

195
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,530
then all we can be doing is doing between
person comparisons here.

196
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,340
Now, again, I made up some outcome data.

197
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,600
So these are made up data, but imagine
that these are real data.

198
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,170
And then I analyzed them, to start with,
the wrong way.

199
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,000
So I ignored the correlations.

200
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,320
I just applied a Chi-square test, ignoring
the correlation.

201
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,390
I'm pretending as if I have 50 drug
treated eyes and

202
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,420
50 placebo treated eyes that have no
relationship to one another.

203
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,190
It turned out that here 27 of the drug
treated eyes improved,

204
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,960
versus 17 of the placebo treated eyes.

205
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,735
And if you just apply a Chi-square test,
you get a p-value of 0.046.

206
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,080
Now what's happening here is that that
p-value is going to be too small,

207
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,960
because what's happening here, so you
kind of go back to the picture.

208
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,910
If a, a particular person, you know,

209
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,960
improves in one eye, they're more likely
to improve in the other eye.

210
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,550
The eyes are related to one another, so
we're kind of over counting people,

211
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,500
therefore our p-value, our sample size in
a sense is overly optimistic and

212
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,480
our p-values are too small.

213
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,880
So now let me show you the correct way to
think about the data.

214
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,696
And to analyse these data, I actually went
ahead and

215
00:11:56,696 --> 00:12:01,392
applied GEE modelling, which I'm going to
get to in a future module.

216
00:12:01,392 --> 00:12:03,490
But here's kind of the correct way to
think about the data.

217
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:09,630
It, I grouped people now here, according
to person, so the level of analysis here,

218
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,570
the unit here is now a person; rather than
an individual eye.

219
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,550
So on the active drug, it turned out that
there were 11 people

220
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,765
where both eyes improved, five people
where one eye improved and

221
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:22,610
nine where, neither of their eyes
improved.

222
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,670
In the placebo group, there is six where
both eyes improved, so

223
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:30,710
somewhat less five where one eye improved
and 14 where no eyes improved.

224
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,020
And so this gives you a better sense of
there's really a difference of

225
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,180
kind of five here, not a difference of
ten, right?

226
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,474
To analyse these data properly we actually
have to apply this GEE

227
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:44,012
modelling technique, which I'll give you
the details of soon, but

228
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:46,197
let me just give you the results of that.

229
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:50,000
So this is just showing you the results
from your hypothetical trial.

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,610
Again 17 out of 50 improved among control
eyes and 27 out of 50 among treated eyes.

231
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,262
If you just play a Chi-square, ignoring
the correlation,

232
00:12:58,262 --> 00:12:59,800
you get a significant p-value.

233
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,610
When you correct for the within-subject
correlation, and by applying this

234
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,930
generalized estimating equation, or GEE
model, you get a p-value of 0.11.

235
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,750
So notice that the odds ratio is the exact
same.

236
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,670
It doesn't affect the point estimate, but
it affects the p-value.

237
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,270
And so in fact,

238
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,690
we have been overly optimistic here by
applying the Chi-square.

239
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,710
Once you correct for

240
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,080
the within subject correlations, it's
actually not statistically significant.
