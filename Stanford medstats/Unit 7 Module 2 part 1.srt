1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,180
In this next module I'm going to tell you
about the test that are used to

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:17,790
compare means between more than two groups
or more than two time points.

3
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,890
I'll start here with The 1 way anova test.

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,050
This is a test that's used to compare
means continous outcomes between 2 or

5
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,610
more independent groups.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:33,440
The T test was limited to 2 groups the
anova can actually 2 or more groups.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,490
Actually the T is a special case of an
anova.

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,510
And remember the T test and anova are both
special cases of linear regression.

9
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,370
So really you could apply, if you had two
groups you could apply an ANOVA, but

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,294
if you have more than two groups you have
to apply an ANOVA or a linear regression.

11
00:00:48,294 --> 00:00:50,044
Let me just start with an example here.

12
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:52,468
Imagine we have a hypothetical trial.

13
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:55,440
We randomize 33 subjects to three groups.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,050
800 milligrams of calcium supplement, 1500
milligrams of a calcium supplement, or

15
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,680
a placebo pill, and the outcome here that
we're looking at is spine bone density.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,220
We want to see if, at the end of the day
the most supplemented group ends up with

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,350
a higher spine bone density.

18
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,600
This is some hypothetical data that I've
made up.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,070
We're going to compare their spine bone
densities.

20
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,070
At one year assuming that all three groups
started with roughly the same

21
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,070
spine bone density.

22
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,680
And here's the results from my
hypothetical data,

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,840
showing you some box plots.

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,050
The placebo group is a little bit lower
than the 800 milligram calcium group and

25
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,910
that's a little bit lower than the 1500
milligram calcium group.

26
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,150
So it looks like there's some increase as
you add more and

27
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,460
more calcium supplement to the diet.

28
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,470
In terms of spine bone density after a
year.

29
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,210
How do we determine whether or

30
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,770
not the differences that you're viewing
here are statistically significant.

31
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,860
This is where a 1 anova would be useful.

32
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,186
How do I get to a 1 way anova.

33
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:53,490
Okay, I'm goign to walk you through the
logic here to get you to the right test.

34
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,230
The question is,

35
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:59,320
is there is a difference in final spine
density in the 3 treatment groups.

36
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,875
What's the outcome variable it's spine
bone density.

37
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:02,480
Density.

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,700
What type of variable is it?

39
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,920
Well, it's a continuous variable.

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,550
Is it normally distributed?

41
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,650
Yes, I am telling you that it's normally
distributed.

42
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,640
Of course you would need to, to do some
legwork to,

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,070
to figure out if it was normally
distributed but

44
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,260
trust me that I tested it and it does
follow a normal distribution.

45
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,710
Are the observations correlated?

46
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,319
No, we have three independent groups.

47
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,891
How many groups are we comparing?

48
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:25,290
Well, we are comparing three.

49
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,110
Three groups here, so a t-test is going to
be insufficient.

50
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,680
So, that's why we're going to need a one
way ANOVA.

51
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,276
How does the ANOVA work?

52
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:37,830
Again, ANOVA's really mathematically the
same as a t-test.

53
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,410
So, the assumptions are the same.

54
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,130
We're assuming that we have a normally
distributed outcome.

55
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,270
I get the a nova is robust against this
assumption and

56
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,400
as long as your sample is big enough.

57
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,700
In fact the central limit theorm kicks in
and so this assumption really matters for

58
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,540
small samples.

59
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,980
We're also assuming equal variance between
the variance between the group.

60
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,640
The way that analysis of variance is
computed.

61
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,200
Is that we are always using a pooled
variance.

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,640
There are some, variance of anova that you
can find that allow for unequal variances.

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,540
But the standard one way anova when you go
into your

64
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,970
computer will assume the variances are
equal that will pool the variances.

65
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,630
So we want to check on that.

66
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,290
Also, a one way anova assumes that the
groups are independent.

67
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,333
So this is analogous to the two sample t
test.

68
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,406
[INAUDIBLE] Now, you might ask a question
here, why wouldn't I just,

69
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:31,170
I've got thre groups,oops, why wouldn't I
just run multiple t tests?

70
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,760
The t tests everyone is comfortable with
tje t test,

71
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,640
why wouldn't I just run a t test that
compares the placebo group to the 800

72
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,970
milligram group, and the 800 milligram
group to the 1500 milligram group, and

73
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,170
the 1500 milligram group to the placebo.

74
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,760
Why wouldn't I just run those 3 t tests as
t tests?

75
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,380
Why do an anova at all.

76
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,990
It's a fair question, and the reason is.

77
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:52,440
Is that remember, we learned last week
that when you run multiple tests,

78
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,251
you increase your type I error rate.

79
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:57,694
Instead of running one test here, you'd be
running three tests.

80
00:03:57,694 --> 00:04:00,076
And, if these were independent
comparisons.

81
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:02,590
Of course, there not independent
comparisons.

82
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,945
But it's very hard to calc, to, to figure
out exactly how what this

83
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:10,060
probability I'm about to calculate is, if
you don't assume independence.

84
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,200
So I'll, I'm going to calculate this
probabilty assuming independence.

85
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,930
It might be slightly different beause
really we dont have indepedence here.

86
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,440
But if the, these were three independent
tests Each one of

87
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,940
those tasks has a 5% chance of a type 1
error.

88
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,990
So what's the chance of making at least
one type 1 error?

89
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,530
That's going to be 1 minus 95% rate to the
third.

90
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,990
Using our little trick in probability,

91
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,450
1 minus the probability of none is equal
to the probability of at least one.

92
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,870
So, we're roughly somewhere around a 14%
chance of making a type 1 error.

93
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,028
That increases our type 1 error rate if we
if we run all those three pairwise tests.

94
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:47,340
The Inova, on the other hand, runs just
one test, just characterizes one p value.

95
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,870
It's called a global test.

96
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,382
Because it's looking at all those
comparisons essentially at once.

97
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:55,730
So the null hypothesis for

98
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,900
the ANOVA, for the one-way ANOVA is that
the means of all the groups are equal.

99
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,220
So like the means by mode density.

100
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,320
In the placebo group is equal to that in
the 800 milligram calcium group is

101
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,270
equal to that in the 1500 milligram
calcium group.

102
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,490
That's our null hypothesis.

103
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,180
The alternative is just that the null
isn't truth,

104
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,460
that at least one of the means is
different.

105
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,390
Notice if we reject the null hypothesis
here,

106
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,390
it does not tell you which groups are
different.

107
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,720
It only tells you that some, one of those
groups is different.

108
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,350
At least one of those groups is different.

109
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,360
So this is a global test, because it gives
us kind of an overall,

110
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,700
a single P value To tell us if there's any
difference here,

111
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,405
but it doesn't tell us specifically where
those differences lie.

112
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:38,030
It's good for controlling the type one
error though because it's

113
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,785
only testing that single hypothesis.

114
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:43,650
Well here's the general idea of an Anova.

115
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,234
I'm not going to walk you through.

116
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:48,630
The exact calcuations in the anova if you
want to be walked through that I have

117
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,150
an op I have some optional material on on
it for you but I don't think its important

118
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,810
to be able to calcuate an anova by hand we
never calculate these by hand these days.

119
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,460
Here's the general idea [COUGH] if I have
3 groups say and

120
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,360
I want to compare the means.

121
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,750
For 3 groups, I can, I could do 3
pair-wise ttests but,

122
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,570
as I said, this would increase my type 1
error.

123
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,200
So what I want to do is actually to look
at those,

124
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,470
the difference in means, those 3
differences in means all at once.

125
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,460
How, what's a way I can look at multiple
differences at once?

126
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,790
Actually the variance.

127
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,650
The variance is a statistic that let's me

128
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,870
look at more than once difference at a
time.

129
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,640
The T-test only allowed me to compare, you
know,

130
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,630
one difference, one difference in in
means.

131
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,600
The variance allows you to compare
multiple differences in means at once.

132
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,150
So the anova is going to involve,

133
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:42,290
it's called analysis of a variance,
because it involves calculating variances.

134
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,210
It involves what's called an F test, so, I
want to know,

135
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,710
is the difference in the means of the
group, the difference of means,

136
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,070
say the 3 groups, is that more than the
background noise?

137
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,210
Is it more than the variability within
groups?

138
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,110
It turns out there is a distribution,

139
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,900
a test that compares the variance between
groups to the variance within group.

140
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,210
So we can summarize the variance between
the group,

141
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,070
that, that represents the differences
between all the groups that won.

142
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,310
That, that variance,

143
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,250
we can compare how different the groups
are between, each other.

144
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,820
To sort of the background, noise.

145
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,570
The variability within the groups.

146
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,060
And this denominator here is analogous to
the pool variance from a t test.

147
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,250
So if we just say,

148
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,780
how much variance is there in spine bone
density within each of those groups.

149
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,630
That represents the variability of spine
bone density.

150
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,600
Does that, does the between group
variance.

151
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,630
The difference between the groups.

152
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,450
Does that exceed that background noise?

153
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,947
That's the idea of the ANOVA.

154
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:40,830
And the ANOVA It's also called an F test
because a ratio of

155
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,070
variance is follows a distribution called
an F-distribution.

156
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,400
Just for fun, I'm just showing you the
F-distribution.

157
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,730
It's yet another distribution.

158
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,710
We've seen a T-distribution, we've seen a
Z-distribution.

159
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,460
If you have a ratio of two variances, that
follows something called

160
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,470
an F-distribution and it depends on two
sets of degree of freedom, the numerator

161
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,330
degree of freedom and the denominator
degree of freedom because the variance and

162
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,210
the numerator has degree of freedoms.

163
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,770
The variance of the denominator has
decreased the freedom.

164
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,880
This forms a different shapes depending on
the, the degrees of freedom.

165
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,890
So that's why when you see the results
from an ANOVA test you're

166
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,550
going to see that an F statistic, it comes
up with an F distribution.

167
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:22,940
Ratios of variances which is what we're
looking at here, follow an F distribution.

168
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,102
The F test tests the hypothesis that those
2 variances are equal.

169
00:08:28,102 --> 00:08:31,180
Equal if the variance between the groups
is equal to the variance within the group

170
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,960
set suggests that the groups do not var,
do not differ in their means.

171
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,222
If the F is close to one

172
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:43,777
suggests that there's no difference in
means across the groups.

173
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:47,550
However, if the F is very far from one
That was suggest that there

174
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,990
is a difference in the between group
variance from the within group variance in

175
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,820
other words taht there is more difference
between the groups than

176
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,790
within the groups that would suggest that
there is a difference between the means

177
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,010
across the groups.

178
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,050
That's general idea of an anova.

179
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,050
Again if you want the details of the
mechanics that is going to be

180
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,950
optional material.

181
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,160
I just want you to understand the general
idea.

182
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,600
[INAUDIBLE] here.

183
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,430
So let me just illustrate that, going back
to our spine bone density example.

184
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:18,000
Within group variability is represented
just by the spread of these box plots.

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,380
So that's kind of the background noise in
spine bone density.

186
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,660
How much variability in any given group is
there in spine bone density?

187
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,820
And we're assuming that that variability
is kind of the,

188
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,680
roughly the same across the different
groups.

189
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,410
Remember, we have an assumption of
equality of variances here.

190
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,870
Well, it's It, it's close enough.

191
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,920
They're, they're pretty similar.

192
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,180
They're not exactly the same but similar.

193
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,850
We want to know, does the difference in
means between the groups exceed that,

194
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,880
kind of, background noise?

195
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,680
That variability within the groups.

196
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,140
So the between group variants can be
presented by looking at the means of

197
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,070
the three groups.

198
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,850
The means are represented by plus signs
here.

199
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,000
Is the difference in the means of those
three groups,

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,520
does that exceed the background
variability?

201
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,104
That, that's what a Nova is set up to
[INAUDIBLE] answer.

202
00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:59,250
And I'll walk you through a brief
calculation here, and

203
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,990
again I don't expect you to be able to
calculate these on your own, but

204
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,950
just understand the concepts here.

205
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,560
So here's some numbers to, to work with.

206
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,100
The placebo group has 11 people in it.

207
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,975
The mean spine bone density at the end of
year one was .92, standard deviation's .1.

208
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:17,880
For the 800 milligram group the mean was
0.94, the standard deviation is 0.08.

209
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,680
For the high calcium supplement group, the
mean is 0.106 and

210
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,230
the standard deviation is 0.11.

211
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,500
Notice that the variance is the standard
deviation of spine bone density is

212
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,072
roughly the same across the different
groups.

213
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:33,580
It probably just trying to pool them as
they do Here's how the f test works.

214
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:39,770
So again, the f test is just a ratio
between

215
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:44,430
the variance to within your variance.

216
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,320
I'll walk you though how these are
actually calculated.

217
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,250
In this particular example, and so much.

218
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,350
Understand the concepts here.

219
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,970
So the between group variance we calculate
by subtracting,

220
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,900
first of all we have to calculate an
overall mean for spine bone density.

221
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,570
So the means of the three groups were
0.92, 0.94 and 1.06.

222
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,720
The overall mean, therefore, is 0.97.

223
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,020
We're going to compare the mean.

224
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,750
From each group, to the overall mean.

225
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,760
And then we're going to square it, add it
up, divide by 3 minus 1.

226
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,470
Notice we're just calculating a variance
here.

227
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,320
This is how we calculate a variance, but
our observations here are the means.

228
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,630
We're calculating a variance for the means
of the.

229
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,765
The three groups.

230
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,700
but that's what we call the between group
variance.

231
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,810
Obviously if that's big,

232
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,770
that means there's a lot of difference in
the means between the three groups.

233
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,730
So we calculate that between group
variance here, it comes out to be .063.

234
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,810
We then calculate the within group
variance,

235
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,700
all that is Is the average of the standard
deviation of bone density or

236
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,799
the variance of bone density in each of
those groups.

237
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,850
Remember the standard deviations were
0.10, 0.08 and 0.11.

238
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,870
We square them to get the variance and we
just take the average variance.

239
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,110
That's the average variability in bone
density within any given Group that comes

240
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,270
out to be .0095.

241
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:58,950
The F statistic is just the ratio of those
two variances.

242
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:04,480
When I put those together here, it comes
out to ave an F statistic of 6.6.

243
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,600
If I took that F statistic to an F chart,
I have to plug in,

244
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,070
I have to tell the computer, the chart,
that I have a numerator degrees of

245
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,230
freedom of 2, a denominator degrees of
freedom of 30.

246
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,620
I can get a corresponding P value.

247
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,320
The P value does come out to be highly
Statistically significant here,

248
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,240
it's something like .00, less than .001.

249
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,215
Because under the null hypothesis the f
should come out to be one.

250
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:29,770
6.6 definitely exceeds that.

251
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,770
Again don't worry too much about the
details of this test.

252
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,340
All of this will be calculated for you by
the computer.

253
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,504
Just get the variable, the basic idea
here.

254
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:39,830
Here.

255
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,690
Now, we get this statistically significant
ANOVA here, that tells us that

256
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,311
at least one of the groups differs, it
doesn't tell us which one differ.

257
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:52,933
If we then want to answer that question
about where those specific

258
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:57,631
differences lie, we would then have to go
in and do some post hoc tests.

259
00:12:57,631 --> 00:13:01,580
Some actual comparing specific groups but
because we

260
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,490
are comparing multiple groups we then have
to compare multple comparisions.

261
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,070
I mentioned last week that there are ways
to correct your P values from

262
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:14,110
multiple comparisions and you could apply
those correction to account for

263
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,380
the fact that your doing multiple T test.

264
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,370
Here's some of the names for

265
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,590
some of those types that you might see in
the statistical analysis program.

266
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,260
Here's how to correct for

267
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,090
multiple comparisons, if you want to do
all those pair wise comparisons to

268
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,930
figure out where the differences really
lie.

269
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,810
The most common one that everyone is

270
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,520
familiar with is called the Bonferroni
correction.

271
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,550
It's very easy to plot, to apply.

272
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,420
You're just basically, dividing your
p-value, [UNKNOWN] .05, by the number of

273
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,855
tests you run, to make a more stringent
cut off for a statistical screen.

274
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:47,089
Bonferroni is very conservative, those
overly conservative.
