1
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:10,250
So last week, I told you how to plot your
observed survival function from

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,760
your data using Kaplan–Meier method
[SOUND].

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,410
Well a lot of times, we'd actually like to
be able to plat that

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,330
hazard function that we observe in our
data.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,250
But it's difficult to do it's really hard
to directly plot that hazard function.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,870
So what we tend to do is we use some
alternative plots that give it

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,216
the hazard function indirectly and that's
the cumulative hazard function.

8
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:32,230
And the log-log plot.

9
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,860
I'm going to tell you, mathematically, now
where those come from and then

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,772
we're going to apply those, practically,
to real data in some upcoming modules.

11
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:45,390
All right, so this slide might scare you
just a little bit,

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,890
I do not expect you to remember anything
from this slide.

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,930
All I am trying to show you here is that
we have now talked about this density

14
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,340
function, the cumulative density, the
survival function and the hazard function.

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,750
There are all these function that are
related to one another and so

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,480
if you have one of those functions, you
can get any one of the others.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,320
I kind of made that point in the last
module.

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,250
So just for fun, I've put all the formulas
here,

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,300
I don't expect it will apply these
formulas,

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,010
the point is just that if you have one,
you can get all the others [SOUND].

21
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,750
The only one that is going to [SOUND] be
of particular interest to us because it

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,830
relates directly to these parts is this
one, where we can

23
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,810
get the survival function from the hazard
or the hazard function from the survival.

24
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,950
The one below it.

25
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,220
I'm going to do the derivations offer
survival from hazard, so this particular

26
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,390
relationship turned out to be useful
because of the fact that it can't directly

27
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:44,330
plot the hazard but we can directly plot
the survival function using capin-mayo.

28
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,910
So again I'm going to zero element just as
one formula.

29
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,900
I don't expect you to be able to derive
anything, but

30
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,020
I'm going to show you using this formula
why the negative log of

31
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,340
the Kaplan-Meier function, for example, is
equal to the cumulative hazard.

32
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,270
This is a particular plot we're going to
need.

33
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,440
So I'll just derive that for you, show you
that that's true, you don't,

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,410
again, don't have to stress out about this
particular one.

35
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,760
I'll just show you just for fun, though.

36
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,040
We have talked about the exponential
[SOUND],

37
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,020
which is a little bit easier to deal with.

38
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,030
So if, you have the exponential function,
if you have,

39
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,750
you have the hazard function, and you know
the hazard function is constant,

40
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,960
which makes it an exponential, so I could
write it like this,

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,640
if you know you're at an exponential and
the hazard function is constant,

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,790
notice I've dropped a little u here, I've
dropped the time bit.

43
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:36,700
Well, if I integrate from zero to t just
each, I'm going to get e

44
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,670
raised to the negative ht which we notice
the survival function for an exponential.

45
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,240
So, that might just make you to feel
comfortable that at least something you

46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,846
expect to come out does in deed come out
of this formula [SOUND].

47
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:50,860
It's a little [SOUND] more complicated if
the hazard function is changing over time.

48
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,230
Because that makes the interval here a
little bit more complicated.

49
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,030
But, what I want to show you is that if
you have the [SOUND],

50
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,530
you have your Kaplan–Meier curve, your
estimated survival curve.

51
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,860
You know we've looked at those kaplan,
Kaplan–Meier curves last week.

52
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,500
That's not the best drawn [SOUND] one but
something.

53
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,420
Where you get [SOUND] like that.

54
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,772
If you have that, it turns out you can
take those survival probability estimates

55
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:16,380
everywhere where you're dropping the curve
here and if you just take the negative log

56
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,050
[SOUND] of those values whatever those
probabilities are and you plot those.

57
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,680
So put negative log of the survival,
[SOUND],

58
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,270
against time, you're going to get the
cumulative hazard function.

59
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,650
You can show that mathematically.

60
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,900
So let me give you some examples.

61
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,910
So again, this plot falls directly out of
this relationship here.

62
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,430
So all I did was I took that formula on
the last page and

63
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,220
I took a log of both side because,
remember this was e,

64
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,560
this was e, e raised to this quantity e
raised to negative of this quantity.

65
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,655
[SOUND] So if I take a log of both size, I
get rid of the exponential [INAUDIBLE] and

66
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:54,240
put the log over here and then this was
negative.

67
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,140
So I taken negative to get rid of the
negative.

68
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,900
So what is this formula right here?

69
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,046
This is the cumulative hazard [SOUND].

70
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:06,185
So if I take negative log of the survival
function,

71
00:04:06,185 --> 00:04:09,105
I'm going to get the cumulative hazard
[SOUND], so

72
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:13,520
this will be a cumulative hazard and over
time if I plot that.

73
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,710
If I have a constant hazard, it's going to
just be a straight line, so

74
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,410
this is useful because now, I can take the
negative log survival function.

75
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,920
I can plot that and most standard
statistical packages will plot that for

76
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,700
you at the click of the button, you don't
even really have to do any thinking here,

77
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,810
you just ask for the negative log survival
[SOUND] plot.

78
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,680
If, it turns out that you look at that
plot and it looks to have straight line,

79
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,390
then you knew that your hazard function is
probably something close to constant.

80
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:43,410
So you going to end up with a straight
line, if your hazard function is constant.

81
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,240
And you can see that here because if I
have a constant hazard function, and

82
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,160
I integrate from 0 to t, again I'm
going to get just c times t.

83
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,070
So I'm going to get, the integral will be
a straight line.

84
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,320
However, if the hazard function is
something that's increasing over time,

85
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,370
like the Y that we've talked about where K
is greater than 1,

86
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,710
then, you're going to get something that's
curve ups, upward.

87
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,900
So when you do that plot, the negative log
revival you going to get something that's

88
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,690
curved upwards and you can just see that
here, so if I integrate for

89
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,030
example CT, that's clearly one that's
increasing over time.

90
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,770
So, if I integrate from zero to t of ct,
I'm going to get ct squared.

91
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,140
So, obviously that's going to be curved
[SOUND] upwards because you're,

92
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,970
it's a quadratic.

93
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,920
It's increasing with time.

94
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,820
Finally, if the hazard function is
decreasing over time,

95
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,120
like a Weibull function where k is less
than one, then it,

96
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,350
we're going to end up with a cumulative
hazard function that's curve downwards.

97
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:34,960
You can see that for

98
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,900
example that if c divided by t is a, for
hazard function it's decreasing over time.

99
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,360
If I iterate from 0 to t, I get z log t
that's going to be decreasing over time.

100
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,960
So it's going to be, curve downwards.

101
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,810
So you can get these negative log plots
and look at them and have some sense of

102
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,220
what the [UNKNOWN] did, what the hazard
function is doing overtime.

103
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,450
So let me just give you a break example of
that.

104
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,650
So remember we had some data from a
pregnancy study last week.

105
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,220
38 women who had a treatment and were then
trying to get pregnant.

106
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,710
They followed from upto two years and

107
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,320
we saw that roughly the hazard rate seemed
to be pretty constant overtime, roughly.

108
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,890
That implies that an exponential model for
these data should be a good fit.

109
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,660
So, this was the Kaplan-Meier Curve.

110
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,480
So, here are my survival probabilities
[SOUND] as estimated,

111
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,930
as observed in my data.

112
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,580
And we sometimes write it like this with a
little hat.

113
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,730
So, that's what we've actually observed in
our data.

114
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,990
I've got all these little survival
probabilities that we

115
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,310
calculated last week.

116
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,710
Now, what if I want to plot the hazard
function for these data?

117
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,720
It turns out to not be that easy to do.

118
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,810
Now, some people have written macros and

119
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,770
things to try to get this I did apply a
MACRO to try to get it to constant,

120
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,590
that the hazard function here, to kind of
see what it looks like over time.

121
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,130
It was kind of a complicated MACRO but

122
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,970
what I get out actually makes a fair
amount of sense.

123
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,890
It looks fairly constant as we're
expecting and puts it at right about 9%

124
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,520
and remember we calculated the average
incidence rate here with about 10%,

125
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,512
so that, it seems about right a little
higher toward the end.

126
00:06:55,512 --> 00:06:59,690
[SOUND] But again not easy to get that
plot.

127
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,042
But what is easy to get is once you've
made your Kaplan–Meier cur,

128
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:08,030
mei meier curve, you can just ask for your
negative log of your Kaplan–Meier curve.

129
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:12,460
Most computer packages do it very easily
and here is what I get for this data.

130
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,720
Notice it has nine points because there
was nine separate estimates on

131
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,630
my Kaplan–Meier curve.

132
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,770
We take negative log of those and then
plot those against time.

133
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,700
And you 'll see that it indeed looks like
a nice straight line so

134
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,050
that would indicate that this probably
does have a constant hazard.

135
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,390
And again, that comes from this
relationship here.

136
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,663
This straight line indicates a constant
hazard function [SOUND].

137
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,840
Another thing that's going to turn out to
be useful that we can use

138
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,760
the Kaplan-Meier estimates.

139
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,610
We can start taking logs of our
Kaplan-Meier estimates.

140
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,970
And get some information about the
underlying hazard functions is that when

141
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,620
we get to the situation where we want to
compare two groups, and

142
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,320
to say if the hazard functions of two
groups, what's their relationship?

143
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,690
Are they parallel?

144
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,560
Are they proportional?

145
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,060
We can do something called a log log plot.

146
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,180
I'm going to do the proof for

147
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,760
you on the next slide for those of you who
want to see it.

148
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,550
It is absolutely optional.

149
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,960
But again, it comes out of that same
direct relationship between a hazard and

150
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,950
a survival.

151
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,400
So, we haven't got to the case yet were I
need to show this, but

152
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,202
I'm going to tell you there are,

153
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:19,920
when we do a lot of these parametric
regression models and also Cox regression.

154
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,310
One of the assumptions is going to be that
we're going to assume that no

155
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:28,090
matter what the hazard functions are, so
here's the hazard function for

156
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,240
group one, here's the [SOUND] hazard
function for group two.

157
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,150
We're going to assume that those functions
over time.

158
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,740
For those two groups are parallel.

159
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,730
And the reason we're going to want to
assume that is because we want to

160
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,930
calculate a single hazard ratio,

161
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,850
which is the ratio of the hazard rates
[SOUND] for those two groups.

162
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,810
But if the hazards are changing over time
[SOUND], that means that

163
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,959
the hazard ratio itself could change over
time, and that gets too complicated.

164
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,410
We'll deal with that eventually, but

165
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,148
we would like to, we'd prefer that it just
be one hazard ratio that we can report.

166
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:03,620
So as long as these hazard rates are
reasonably kind of parallel over time,

167
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,390
it's probably reasonal, reasonable to
report a single hazard ratio.

168
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:14,220
If the hazard rates for whatever reason
turn out to not be parallel over time.

169
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,182
So here's the hazard rate for

170
00:09:15,182 --> 00:09:18,790
group [SOUND] one over time and here's the
hazard rate for group two over time.

171
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,170
You can imagine a situation where two
groups are crossing like this.

172
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,160
Then it wouldn't make sense to report a
single hazard ratio because you

173
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,220
can see that ha, group one has a way
higher hazard at the beginning, but

174
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,280
then has a much smaller hazard at the end.

175
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,660
So there isn't a single hazard ratio
there.

176
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,810
So one of the things that we're going to
need to be able to evaluate, the very

177
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,960
important for a lot of the regression
models we're going to be talking about,

178
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,680
is something called the proportional
hazards assumption.

179
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,380
And is this is just saying that if that
assumption is met that

180
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,130
the hazard functions for the two group are
reasonably parallel.

181
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,070
Since it's hard to directly draw those
hazard functions from out data,

182
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,140
it's hard to evaluate this proportional
hazards assumption directly.

183
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,990
However, it turns out that we already
talked about the negative log in

184
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,660
the survival plot.

185
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,620
That's the cumulative hazard function.

186
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,310
Turns out if you take one more log of that
and you plot the log,

187
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,900
negative log of the Kaplan–Meier estimate
for

188
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,220
one group and another group, here's this
log negative log.

189
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,300
And again, this is a plot you can get in a
click of a button in

190
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,716
most standard statistical packages.

191
00:10:20,716 --> 00:10:22,438
You don't have to think too hard to get
this, but

192
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:24,400
the computer [SOUND] will give it to you.

193
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,520
It turns out that if the log, negative
log, of the survival functions,

194
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,430
if those are parallel, then it's tr,

195
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,570
the case that the underlying hazard
functions are also parallel.

196
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,960
Since we can't directly plot the hazard
functions,

197
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,610
we instead plot the long negative log of
the survival functions for

198
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,050
the different groups and we look in to see
whether or not those are parallel.

199
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,280
So this is going to be a very important
plot that we're going to use when we're

200
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,520
doing regression and we're going to
particularity talk a lot about it.

201
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,360
When we talk about Caulk's regression,

202
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,460
which is sometimes also called
proportional hazard regression.

203
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,300
So this assumption is obviously very
important for that.

204
00:10:59,300 --> 00:10:59,850
Alright for

205
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:04,300
those of you who would like me to walk you
through the proof of why the log negative

206
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,220
logs being parallel guarantees you that
the hazard functions are parallel.

207
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,260
I will now show you that if you want to
fast forward over that part of

208
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,990
the [SOUND], of the module that is
actually optional.

209
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,140
Alright, just for fun, if you like to see
proof stand out I am

210
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,700
going to prove to you now that if two
hazard functions are parallel.

211
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,119
Their, their log negative log plots will
also be parallel.

212
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,580
So starting with the second we have two
hazard functions.

213
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,959
I'm going to call one of the hazard
functions for

214
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,290
group' i' each' i' of' t' that's rare
hazard [SOUND] function over time if' j'

215
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,290
of' t' is a second group,' j' group,' j's
hazard function over time.

216
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,510
If group-i's function is always the same
distance from group-j's function we

217
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,960
can just multiply by a constant which I'm
calling HR fit here for hazard ratio but

218
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,044
imagine that's just number [SOUND].

219
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,800
So the proportional hazard's assumption
would say that there is a single hazard

220
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,140
ratio, a single constant that describes
the distance between two hazard curves.

221
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,030
So lets say i, edge i t [SOUND] looks like
that and h j t looks like that.

222
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,410
If they're parallel over time we can
calculate a single hazard ratio that

223
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,740
describes they're always going to be
parallel, so this equation will be true.

224
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,140
Alright, so then if this is true, I can
then refer back to

225
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,010
the relationship between the survival
function and the hazard function.

226
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,720
So the survival for j will just be equal
to e raised to negative of this

227
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,710
integral from zero to t of the hazard
function for j.

228
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,350
I then can do the same thing for the
survival function for

229
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:40,050
i, except remember the hazard function for
i is a function of the one for j.

230
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,030
So I am now going to plug in for each i of
t for the hazard function of group i,

231
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,550
I am going to plug in the hazard ratio
times the hazard function for j.

232
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,380
So now we only have one unknown.

233
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,700
The hazard function for j that we're
dealing with.

234
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,720
I can go one step further now and

235
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,600
just recognize that I can take a constant
out of an integral.

236
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,250
So it, the hazard ratio is just a
constant.

237
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,730
I'm going to pull that out of the
integral.

238
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,680
Just a little bit of math there.

239
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,450
I can go one step further then, and also
pull the hazard ratio out of the power.

240
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,130
So e raised to hr times something is the
same as e raised to

241
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,650
that something raised to hr.

242
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,710
So, I'm just doing a little bit of
mathematical rearrangement here.

243
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,870
I can show therefore that the survival
function for i is equal to

244
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,540
the survival function for j raised to hr.

245
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,990
And why the survival function for j?

246
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,790
Where did this come from?

247
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,070
Well, this quantity right here.

248
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,180
That's raised to the power hr is this
quantity right here.

249
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,190
So this is equal to the survival function
for j.

250
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,510
So I've just replaced that quantity with
the survival function for j.

251
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,710
And now we've shown that the survival
function for

252
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:51,540
i Is equal to the survival function for j
raised to the hazard ratio, this constant.

253
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,960
That's true as long as their hazard
functions are parallel.

254
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,800
Alright, but then we can go even a little
bit further.

255
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,220
So now, to get rid of that power, we don't
like power.

256
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,090
So we can take a log of both sides.

257
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,080
That will get rid of that power.

258
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,940
So I take a log of the survival function
for i and then I take the log of

259
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:13,350
the survival function for j, raise to the
hazard ratio power.

260
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,040
Well that hr can come down in front
because the logs you can get rid of

261
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,000
the powers.

262
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,880
So, the log of the survival function for

263
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,204
i is equal to hr times the log of the
survival function for j [SOUND].

264
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:29,580
going to go one step further here and then
take the log, negative log of the survival

265
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,170
function for I just bear with me to show
you, I'll show you where this is going.

266
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,440
So we take the log, negative and we can
gate both sides and

267
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,570
then take the log of both sides of this
equation.

268
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,130
So I get the log negative log of the
survival function for i, is equal to

269
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:48,390
the log of negative HR times the log of
the survival function for j [SOUND].

270
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,290
All right, well, keep going a little bit
further,

271
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,120
the reason we take another log here is
that we can if we take a log of

272
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,170
our product that's equal to the sum of
logs.

273
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,890
So, this one says the same, but then this
becomes the log of

274
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:05,050
HR which is just a constant plus the log
negative log of the survival curve for

275
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,435
j the survival function for j.

276
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:10,820
So notice now we have the log negative log
of the survival curve for

277
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:16,320
group i is equal to a constant because the
log of a constant is still a constant,

278
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,780
plus the log, negative log, of the
survival curve for j.

279
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,280
So that tells you that the log-negative
log plots should now be parallel and

280
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,740
they'll differ by this constant log of HR.

281
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,110
So that is the proof, there if the log
negative log plots are parallel,

282
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,750
then the hazard function, underlying
hazard functions are parallel.

283
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,070
So we are going to apply this to some real
data in some upcoming examples,

284
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,700
with a few more explanations here for

285
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,100
those who need a little more tips on the
math here [SOUND].

286
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,980
We're going to then apply this to a some
upcoming examples, and

287
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,240
I'll just give you an example of a log
negative log plot.

288
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,730
Plot just so you'll [INAUDIBLE] to
recognize these.

289
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,110
So these, these are some data comparing a
treated group

290
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,320
here to a control group here.

291
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,740
And [SOUND] this is showing you the log
negative plots of [INAUDIBLE] log

292
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,660
negative log survival plots of those two
groups.

293
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,450
Again the survival plots were just a
Kaplan-Meier plots.

294
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,240
We look at those log, negative log parts
we are looking to see whether or

295
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,595
not they are parallel.

296
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,510
With real data, of course, it's never
going to be perfectly parallel.

297
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,780
I would say that these data aren't bad.

298
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,630
One of the groups has many events occur
very early on and

299
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,970
there is no, kind of no more data.

300
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,790
But they look pretty parallel while they
certainly cross over and

301
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,200
we are going to talk a lot more about
interpreting these log, log plots

302
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,250
in a future module but I just wanted to
sort of a mathematical background.

303
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,700
So that you know where these log-log plots
come from.

304
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,780
[BLANK_AUDIO]
