1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,700
Many procedures can use something called a
buy statement.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,930
This allows you to run a procedure on all
the subsets of the data,

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,620
specified by some categorical variable.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,520
For example, if you have a variable for
gender, which can either have a variable

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,070
of m for male, or f for female, we can
specify by gender, to run a procedure

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,110
on a subset restricted to males and then
again on the subset restricted to females.

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,510
>> Now suppose you want to calculate the
mean weight for men and for women.

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,980
We already showed you how to do this using
the where statements in proc means.

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,940
But if you do it this way, you have to
repeat all your code for

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,740
each subset you're interested in.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,880
If you're looking at a variable with more
than two levels,

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,040
it could extremely cumbersome to repeat
your code multiple times.

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,470
Instead, if you specify by gender as we
show you here,

14
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,689
you automatically run your procedure on
all the levels of the gender variable.

15
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,690
>> But there's one catch before we're
ready.

16
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,710
If you tried to run this code, you'll find
that it doesn't work.

17
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,970
Before you can use a by statement, you
need to sort your data set.

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,860
We need to sort it by the gender variable
first.

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,945
In this code, I first sort by gender, and
then use a proc means with a by statement.

20
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:19,970
Now, it will give us the output for

21
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,210
females, and for males all at once.

22
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,250
>> So just to summarize, Proc sort can be
used to sort your data in ascending or

23
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,260
descending order, and you can use it to
remove duplicates as well.

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,390
>> If you want to use a by statement to
run a procedure on multiple subsets of

25
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,890
the data, you need to use proc sort to
sort the data on your variable of

26
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,650
interest first.
