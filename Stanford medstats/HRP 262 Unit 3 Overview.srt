00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,570
Welcome to week three of the course.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,480
This week we're going to start our two
week discussion of Cox regression.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,550
Cox regression is widely used in the
medical literature because

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,460
unlike parametric regression, we're not
going to make any

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,170
assumptions about the underlying form of
the baseline hazard function.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,290
And that's going to turn out to be really
convenient.

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,289
We're just going to avoid estimating that
altogether.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,140
So this week I'm just going to introduce
you to Cox regression.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,520
We're going to talk about the basic model,
the likelihood function,

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,120
how to evaluate some basic assumptions,
looking at residuals.

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,250
And I'll tell you about stratification.

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,220
We'll also talk a lot about some examples.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,050
Just as a preview, one of the examples
that we're going to talk about this week

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,930
was an interesting study that came out in
the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2001.

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,530
And you can see that it was about Academy
Award Winners,

17
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,490
always an interesting topic.

18
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,650
The researchers were interested in the
question of whether you know

19
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,120
how people get nominated for the academy
awards, and they say, oh,

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,540
it was just an honor to be nominated as if
you know winning doesn't matter.

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,870
So they wanted to kind of get at that
question of,

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,710
specifically how does winning an academy
award versus just being nominated,

23
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,440
how does that effect your longevity, if at
all?

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,720
This gets to things like your social
status affecting longevity and, and so on.

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,696
So, what they did was they compared people
who actors and

26
00:01:25,696 --> 00:01:29,106
actresses, who had actually won Academy
Awards with controls -

27
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:34,110
actors and actresses who had never even
been nominated as well as with nominees.

28
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,940
Those are people who had been nominated
but never won.

29
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,440
So what you are seeing on the left hand
side here is the Kaplanâ€“Meier curve,

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,450
comparing the nominees only to the
winners, and

31
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,850
in this initial analysis, it looked like
there was a clear survival advantage for

32
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,910
the winners versus the nominees.

33
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,728
Now this particular paper generated a lot
of debate and

34
00:01:55,728 --> 00:02:00,267
interest because it's not clear exactly
the correct way.

35
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:04,299
Statistically to look at these data and
this particular analysis stuff for

36
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,155
the one that was first published,

37
00:02:06,155 --> 00:02:09,790
has a bias in it that we will talk about
in an upcoming module.

38
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,890
But in the initial analysis it looked like
there was a pretty clear survival

39
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,210
advantage for the winners, which of course
is, is interesting.

40
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,560
They then used Cox regression to analyze
these data, so Cox regression allows

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,250
them to quantify the effect as well to
adjust for potential confounders.

42
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,210
So, you're seeing in the table on the
right hand side over here is the result,

43
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,660
results of Cox regression.

44
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,010
It's also sometimes called Proportional
Hazards Model.

45
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,300
So, this is the results of a Cox
regression model.

46
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,340
I'll just look at the winners compared
with the nominees.

47
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,200
That's a really interesting one.

48
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,020
So in the basic analysis, what, they're
showing here in the table are actually

49
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,840
hazard ratios but they've presented them a
little bit differently.

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,990
So this 25 represents the relative
reduction in mortality rate.

51
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,420
In other words, this corresponds to a
hazard ratio of 0.75.

52
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,830
They thought it would be easier to
interpret if they actually did

53
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,210
the percent reduction till a hazard ratio
of 0.75 translates to

54
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:07,230
a 25% reduction in the mortality rate for
winners versus nominees.

55
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,160
That was in the basic model they tried
adjusting for various things.

56
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,850
It did attenuate a little bit, but

57
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,740
even in the final model, there still seems
to be some survival advantage.

58
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,042
Again these are the types of data that we
can analyze with Cox regression.

59
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:23,300
There are some fun details of this
particular analysis that we'll get into in

60
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,200
a future module.
