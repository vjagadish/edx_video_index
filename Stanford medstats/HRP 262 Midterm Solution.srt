1
00:00:05,694 --> 00:00:06,590
[BLANK_AUDIO]
So, I've been thinking that

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,310
it would be really useful, to walk you
through a real data analysis experience,

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,574
to show you how I would approach real data
from start to finish.

4
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:18,130
What are the steps you need to take?

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,730
What are things you need to think about
while looking at real data?

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,820
This module will obviously be, a
condensed.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,690
The version of a real data analysis which
would take you a lot longer in real time.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,490
And I thought it would be fun, to use as
the basis of this exercise,

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,230
the midterm dataset because you've all
just finished grappling with that data.

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,750
So, I've tried to layout all the steps
that you should take.

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,130
When approaching a real, data analysis.

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,890
I'm going to go through each of these
steps in turn as applied,

13
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,780
to the Academy Award winners data set that
you had for your midterm.

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,010
One thing that's really important to keep
in mind,

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,910
is that you need to document all of these
steps.

16
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,590
You need to document any changes you make
to the variables, any new variables you

17
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,610
create, any participants that you exclude,
even when you reformat variables.

18
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,950
What we're striving for here, is what's
called reproducible research.

19
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,720
This is the idea that, you should be able
to hand me the data set that you used,

20
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,650
to produce your paper as well as a piece
of code, and somebody else.

21
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,830
Should be able to run that code on that
data set and

22
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,720
come up with the, same numbers that you
have in your tables and figures.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,930
And that's, kind of sounds like it should
be trivial, right?

24
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,140
If you have the data set it should be easy
to reproduce those numbers, but

25
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,560
in fact there are so many small decision
points and

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,140
steps that go into a data analysis it
turns out that that's not trivial at all.

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,800
You really need to precisely document that
step, so

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,629
that somebody could reproduce those
numbers.

29
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,310
So, I'm going to go again through, each of
these steps in turn.

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,370
I just want to point out that, [SOUND] the
analysis for the Academy Award winner data

31
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:55,690
set is an explanatory analysis, our goal
is to answer questions about etiology.

32
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,900
Does being a winner, have an effect on,
mortality rates.

33
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,930
Does winning an Academy Award have an
effect, on mortality rates.

34
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,320
This is not a predictive goal.

35
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,570
And, so, all of the steps that I have laid
out here, are specific to, when you

36
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,840
have explanatory [INAUDIBLE] analysis, if
you are doing a predictive analyses

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,710
trying to build a predictive model, a lot
of the steps would be the same.

38
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,110
But I will just point out that, the way
that you would build the final model

39
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,710
would be different, because the goal would
be to kind of find the model that was,

40
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,710
the most predictive so you wouldn't be
worrying.

41
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,960
So much about confounders and things like
that.

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,990
You would also be, performing some kind of
validation.

43
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,440
And we don't have to do that for an
explanatory model.

44
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,070
So, step 7, 8, and 9 would be different.

45
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,810
I just want to point that out.

46
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,870
[SOUND] The other thing I want to point
out is that I'm not going to spend so

47
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,560
much time, on steps 4, 9, or 10 in this
module.

48
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,350
That's because the midterm dataset didnt
have any missing data, as we'll see.

49
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,560
So you don't really have to do anything to
deal with it.

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,640
And you, therefore, it did not, it also
didn't have any outliers to speak of so,

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,530
we didn't need to do any sensitivity
analyses.

52
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,650
I also did not ask you, for the midterm to
create any professional looking graphics.

53
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,510
Which is because it's pretty hard to,

54
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,040
graphically display the time changing
groups.

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,190
[SOUND] So I will, not do much on 4, 9,
and 10 here.

56
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,490
But I'll just let you know that, for your
final exam, I will make sure to

57
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,550
have a data set that has missing data, and
I will be, sure to be sure asking you for

58
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,920
informative graphics, so that you will get
experience with those steps as well.

59
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,790
[BLANK_AUDIO]

60
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,800
So the first thing you need to do when you
get a real data set,

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,060
is just to get the data set ready for
analysis.

62
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,610
And this is very basic.

63
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,590
You need to, make sure everything is
formatted and named appropriately.

64
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,950
You need to import the dataset into your
com, statistical analysis program.

65
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,610
Create any new variables that are just
basic derivations of other variables.

66
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,670
So, I gave you the dataset for, for this.

67
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,890
Exercise, as I just downloaded it right
from, the website.

68
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,300
The authors, who published the real
analysis of this data,

69
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,920
had provided the data all as in, in the
appendix of their paper, and

70
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,580
I just downloaded it and handed it to you.

71
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,600
I didn't, clean it up at all for you.

72
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,920
So this, represents kind of the thing that
you might get from somebody.

73
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,990
The, data dictionary, is very condensed
but, you know, the variables are mostly.

74
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,410
Self explanatory but,

75
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,280
they've stuck it in the dictionary right
at the top of this Excel file.

76
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,570
So, one of things you're going to have to
do,

77
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,460
is you're going to have to delete all of
this, before you load it

78
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,610
into your statistical analysis program or
you'll end up with all this garbage.

79
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,530
Also, notice that the way that they've
named variables, they have a lot of.

80
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,530
Question marks and equal signs.

81
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,550
I don't like those in my variable names
so, I'm going to get rid of those.

82
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,830
I'm just going to rename them in the Excel
file before I load, things into SAS.

83
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,060
And, so a little bit of clean up needs to
be done before I even input the data.

84
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,660
So, before I imported the data I, my file
looked like this.

85
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,220
I, didn't do anything other than, delete
that garbage at the top,

86
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,580
the data dictionary.

87
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,150
And, I changed a few of the variable names
to get rid of things like, equal signs and

88
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,618
question marks, so you'll notice that some
of the names here are different from

89
00:04:57,618 --> 00:05:01,510
what we started with, tried to make the
data a little more informative.

90
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,480
I then imported, the data into SAS and

91
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,980
of course, you would import into whatever,
statistical package you were working in.

92
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,630
Once I had things in SASS I did a few
other steps.

93
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,460
A few other basic steps to get ready for
my analysis.

94
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,160
So, one of the things is that there were
four variables.

95
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,530
Born in the USA, born white, name change
and

96
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:27,360
genre drama, that were, originally coded
as yes, no variables.

97
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,380
They're character variables.

98
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,250
And that's perfectly fine to leave them as
yes, no character variables.

99
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,460
I just happen to prefer, when I deal with
binary variables,

100
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,040
I prefer them to be coded as 1,

101
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,050
0 so that I can treat them as numbers,
rather than as character variables.

102
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,710
I find that a little bit easier.

103
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:47,910
So, what I went ahead and did with code,
was to re-code all the yeses to 1s and

104
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,850
all the nos to 0s for these four
variables.

105
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,970
And also to change it from a character.

106
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,710
To a numeric variable.

107
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,070
I also, as I was, bothering to do that
with code.

108
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,130
I thought, well, I might as well change
the variable names.

109
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,050
I got rid of the underscores.

110
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,050
I don't really like, underscores in my
variable name.

111
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,210
So, they're slightly renamed.

112
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,730
I then had to think about, since we're
doing a survival analysis.

113
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,030
What am I going to do, in terms of the
time variable?

114
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,340
How am I going to treat dates, and things
like that?

115
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,020
So, what I decided, for

116
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,100
the time variable for this data set, was,
everything was given in years.

117
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,440
And so, I decided to keep it in years, and
treat the years as numbers.

118
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,880
It was, would have been harder to treat
the year variable as a date/time variable.

119
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,850
Because we don't, w, date time variables
are in days, and

120
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,290
we don't really want things in days, we
can just keep it in years.

121
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,410
It's perfectly fine to subtract 1960,
subtract 1900 and

122
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,500
get that somebody was 60 years old and
just keep everything in, in numbers.

123
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,990
So, I've just kept the years in numbers.

124
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,490
I then, realized that I'm going to need to
use age since birth, as my time scale, so

125
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,580
this is looking at.

126
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,280
You know, total life time.

127
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,740
So, I'm going to be using age since birth
as the time-scale here.

128
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,330
And, that's actually an easy variable to
create, because time,

129
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,460
what I'm going to be calling my time
variable here,

130
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,470
is just going to be the age at either
censoring or at death.

131
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,970
So to create the time variable, I'm
calling it time,

132
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,230
because in survival analysis I'm thinking
of this as my time variable.

133
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,500
You could have named the variable age,
because it's equivalent to age.

134
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,320
So, to get this new time variable, all I
did was I subtracted the final year,

135
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,440
which was the year they were censored or
died.

136
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,750
I subtracted the, from that the birth
year, the year they were born.

137
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,920
That's going to give me their age in
years, and that is my time scale.

138
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,850
So, I just have to call that variable
time.

139
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,870
You could have also called it a.

140
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,320
Age.

141
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,430
I also, decided to create some other new
variables that I knew I was

142
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,090
going to need for this analysis.

143
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,720
So, the point of this analysis was to
compare people who won academy awards,

144
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,940
to people who were only ever nominated, to
people who were never even nominated.

145
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,680
So we call those groups the winner group,
the nominee group and the control group.

146
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,830
So, I thought right from the onset I knew
I was going to have,

147
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,580
to have a variable that denoted those
groups.

148
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,240
In the original data set.

149
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,510
The, authors had recorded the number of
wins.

150
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,780
I don't really care how many times you
won,

151
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,240
that wasn't, important to this particular
question that we were asking.

152
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,970
I really just need to know if you were a
winner at all, or not.

153
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,770
So, I just changed, I made new variable,
winner.

154
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,060
And I said if your wins, if your number of
wins are greater than 0,

155
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,170
then you are a winner, you won an Academy
Award.

156
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,950
If you number of wins was 0, then you are
not in the winner category.

157
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,840
I created another variable with that
whether or

158
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,020
not you were ever nominated at all.

159
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,790
And so, I said, if your nominations,
again, was more than 1.

160
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,730
1 or more, more than 0.

161
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,420
Then you're a nominee.

162
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,130
If it's, if you were never nominated, then
you're not a nominee.

163
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,120
I made another category that was, only
nominated,

164
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,790
which separates, the winners out of those
who were nominated, but never won.

165
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,490
So, if your nominations was greater than 0
but,

166
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,310
your wins was equal to 0, then you're in
that nomination only category.

167
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,880
I know I'm going to need that group
separated as well.

168
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,114
And, then finally I, defined a control
group which is if you're not a nominee and

169
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:57,280
you were not a winner.

170
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,180
If you never were a nominee, you never
won, then you're in the control group.

171
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,210
So, I made those new variables because I
knew I was going to need those for

172
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:03,970
a lot of the analysis.

173
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,070
So, once you've prepped you data set got
it ready for analyses, then you are going

174
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,670
to go through and check the data set,
check all of your variables to check for

175
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,290
errors, outliers, extreme values and for
missing data.

176
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,410
So, I just did a simple thing for this one
I used the proc,

177
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:27,030
means option which just asks for summary
statistics, I specifically, wanted to see

178
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,570
the sample size for each variable, because
that will tell me about missing data.

179
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,600
As well as the minimum and the maximum to
make sure, to see whether or

180
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,250
not I have any outliers.

181
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,370
By the way, in SAS, if you do variable
_all_ SAS, will just do this for

182
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,570
all your variables and you don't need to
write them out separately.

183
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,020
So, this was a pretty small dataset.

184
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,080
There's not so many variables.

185
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,440
So, I just used that all command.

186
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,270
So, here is all of my variables, in this
dataset.

187
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,620
It's going to give me statistics on the ID
number because I asked for

188
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,560
all the variables, that's not really very
important.

189
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,630
But, we can kind of go through each one of
these variables, and

190
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,610
first thing you notice is that, there's no
missing data in this dataset.

191
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,480
So the, authors who prepared the dataset
filled in all of the values.

192
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,170
So, for example, you see that for every
variable there's 1670,

193
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,760
so that means that, that none of those
variables are missing anything.

194
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,770
There's two variables that have, 239 and
768, those are the ones that

195
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:22,040
only apply to the winners or to the
nominees, so that's why those have fewer.

196
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,420
That's not missing data.

197
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,320
But, you see that, there's no missing data
on it.

198
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,150
Any of the variables.

199
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,120
So, that's nice to know.

200
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,510
That means we're not going to have to work
too hard in terms of missing data.

201
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,060
I then went through and looked at all the
minimums and the maximums.

202
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,920
So, I'll just point out a few here.

203
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,670
So, the birth year, the earliest birth
year was 1858.

204
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,670
The latest birth year is 1988.

205
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,900
That's very important to know, and
understanding these data.

206
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,750
The, final, the last possible time to
event was 2001.

207
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,068
That's because these data were collected,
in 2001.

208
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,980
They were collected or at least updated in
2001,

209
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,690
that's the last year we have information
for.

210
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:01,210
It's probably great for somebody, time for
somebody to update this data set again.

211
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:05,050
So we can reanalyze these, but that was
the last data set that we have available.

212
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,340
So that everything ends at 2001 and

213
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,660
you are censored there if you haven't died
by then.

214
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,940
You can see that all the binary variables
go from 0 to 1 there's no weird,

215
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,980
values in here.

216
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,420
If you go down to time, this is, their
ages at death or

217
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,130
censoring, and they range from 13 to 104
those are reasonable ages.

218
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,710
We can also look at the, years in which
people were nominated and

219
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,050
won Academy awards, those ranges look
reasonable.

220
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,270
All of these look, reasonable.

221
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,210
Somebody ac, actually was in 290 films.

222
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,920
That's not unreasonable over a career.

223
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,220
You could be in 290 films.

224
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,030
So, everything looks pretty good there.

225
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,360
I then, went through and checked, the
variables for consistencies.

226
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,340
This is checking one variable against
another.

227
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,890
To see if there are things that are, that
just don't make sense.

228
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,610
And so, for example, there's a lot of
years here.

229
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,650
If somebody was you know,

230
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,260
died before they were born, that would be
an example of an inconsistency.

231
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,800
I went through and found [INAUDIBLE]
inconsistencies I could think of and

232
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,090
went through and flag, any person who had.

233
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,100
A yes on any of these if statements.

234
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,635
So, for example, if there's a variable
fourstar films, if you made more fourstar

235
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:15,960
fil-, more fourstar films, than you made
films overall, that would be impossible.

236
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,060
If you were born after you died or

237
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,290
after you were censored, that would be
impossible.

238
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,980
If you, had won an Academy Award but never
been nominated, that would be impossible.

239
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,400
I, I'll kind of go through just some of
these.

240
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,300
If you were a control, but you have a year
for your no, first nomination or

241
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,200
first win, that would be impossible.

242
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,820
If you, made your first film after you
won,

243
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,520
after you won your first Academy Award,
that would be impossible.

244
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,450
If you made your first film after the
first you,

245
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,820
after you were, you were nominated, that
would be impossible.

246
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,150
If you were nominated after your first win
that would be impossible.

247
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,610
So, all of these are the sort of things
that would make, not make sense.

248
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,700
If something's going wrong, there's at
least some error in the data, for

249
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,880
all of these, if these, if these are
flagged.

250
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,100
If you have more wins than you have
nominations,

251
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
all of these kind of inconsistencies.

252
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,860
So, I just made one variable called a flag
variable.

253
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,740
I set it equal to 1 if any of these came
out true for for

254
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,060
an observation in the data set.

255
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,040
And then, I printed out everybody who had
[SOUND] flag equals 1.

256
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,090
So, when I did this,

257
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,740
I came out with six people, where the flag
variable was equal to 1.

258
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,720
[SOUND] And I just printed these out.

259
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,640
These are the ones that meet, any of those
inconsistencies on the previous slide.

260
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,750
I came out with six.

261
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:34,600
Great example, person with ID 908 if you
look, their first film was made in 1989.

262
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,120
But they were first nominated, for an
Academy Award in 1985.

263
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,060
Well obviously, one of those dates is
wrong.

264
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,180
If we were, doing a real data analysis, we
might go back and

265
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,680
try to figure out, for 908, where the
error lies, and to fix the error.

266
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,800
We can go back and do that.

267
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,580
I don't know who person 908 is, so for

268
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:58,630
the purposes of the midterm, I just said
to exclude these kinds of inconsistencies.

269
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:03,060
1192 was again, the first film occurred
after they were first nominated.

270
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,104
There's some error in there.

271
00:14:05,104 --> 00:14:05,930
1430.

272
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:11,332
Let's see, there were, they, their first
win year was in 1952, so they first one

273
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:16,588
an Academy Award in 1952, but they weren't
first nominated until 1960, so

274
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:22,939
that's an inconsistency, and 1521 they had
their first, film was made, in 1988,

275
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:28,355
but they were nominated first way back in
1971, so those are all inconsistencies.

276
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:33,319
Now one of them, one of the instances,
inconsistency, that came up 1075,

277
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:38,137
if you look in the fine print of, the
paper that was published in 2006 where

278
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:43,028
the authors reanalysed, this data set,
they actually said they excluded this

279
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:48,138
person and the reason is if you look at
the date of death they died in 1994 but

280
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:51,350
they were first nominated for an Oscar in
1995,

281
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,447
when I found that inconsistency i thought
to myself that it might be possible.

282
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:59,711
For somebody to die between the time that
a film is made and

283
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:05,370
before they are nominated because you can
be nominated posthumously after you die.

284
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,818
So I went and googled it just for fun, I
actually googled you know,

285
00:15:09,818 --> 00:15:12,740
deaths after being nominated for an Oscar
after death, and you

286
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,970
can find a Wikipedia page which lists the
people who were nominated after they died.

287
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,270
There aren't that many, and

288
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,620
I was actually able to find that there
indeed was a person who died in 1994 and

289
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,180
was nominated in 1995 after they died and
who had been born in 1953.

290
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:33,220
So I am pretty certain, that this
represents Massimo Troisi who was in

291
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,070
Il Postino, and therefore that that's a
real data, that all that data is real, and

292
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,220
there's nothing wrong with it and

293
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,229
therefore, I did not exclude that, that
person.

294
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,190
All right, the next thing you're going to
want to do,

295
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,910
in your data analysis is to spend a lot of
thing studying your variables.

296
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,720
And you can see that in this whole
process,

297
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,290
we are spending a lot of time on very
basic things about the data.

298
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,647
I haven't gotten at all yet

299
00:15:56,647 --> 00:16:00,880
to the question of you know, do winners
live longer than nominees.

300
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,820
So I'm going to ask for univariate
statistics and

301
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,160
histogram and explore those for all the
variables in my dataset so

302
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,150
that I have a firm understanding of what
these variables look like.

303
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,340
again, you can insass, you can do
histograms and

304
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,780
basic statistics with proc univariate if
you ask for underscore all underscore,

305
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,630
you get all the variables, and since there
aren't that many here.

306
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,690
I went ahead and got all of the
histograms.

307
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,970
This is the histogram for ID.

308
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,160
It automatically comes up, because I've
asked for all.

309
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,559
But it is interesting to just note that
the ID numbers get restarted at 2,000 and

310
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,155
at 3,000.

311
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:34,970
That probably has something to do with the
fact that this data set was

312
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,860
updated at one point.

313
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,000
Those may be the, the updates.

314
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,060
So, even there there's something
interesting.

315
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,980
Here are some histograms for those binary
variables.

316
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,400
This was country of birth, whether or not
you where born in the U.S.A or not.

317
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,250
And what you can see is that,
interestingly, I mean a,

318
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,968
about 70% of people where born in the
coun, in the U.S.A, but there

319
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:58,400
are almost 30% of actors and actresses who
where born in another country.

320
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,430
We're tracing, you know, Back to the 1800s
and things.

321
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,400
So that's very interesting.

322
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,920
And that might affect the mortality.

323
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,660
In terms of race however.

324
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,210
That they're almost all were white.

325
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:14,740
There's only a very small percentage of
people who were races other than whites,

326
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,370
who were nominated or actors and actresses
in that time.

327
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,780
So, the variable, born white.

328
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,500
Whether or not you were, of white race.

329
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,630
It might be interesting.

330
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,570
It might be related to longevity.

331
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:30,130
But, you have to keep in mind that the non
white group is very small here.

332
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,390
gender.

333
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,890
So this is the males, and this is the
females.

334
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,500
You'll notice it's fairly well balanced.

335
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,860
But there were, in general more men in
films.

336
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,300
Especially, in the early days.

337
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,020
And then we have this variable, name
change.

338
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,040
Actors and actresses sometimes change
their names.

339
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,630
I didn't do a heck of a lot with this
variable.

340
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,620
There was a fair number of people who
changed their names.

341
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,390
I don't think that that would be related
to mortality, however.

342
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,300
Then this is, these are the, this is the
distribution of the birth years.

343
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,280
So, again, we went from 1858 to 1988,
where the birth years,.

344
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,470
And everything in between.

345
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:11,290
Final is the year of death or censoring,
and since censoring ha,

346
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,070
the last time we updated the data was in
2001, we have a huge bar at 2001,

347
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:19,360
just, that's just the last date of
censoring from, for most people.

348
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,420
How many people died or

349
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:26,440
were alive, this is died or alive, so this
is the alive bar.

350
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,620
And this is the died bar, died here is the
outcome of interest.

351
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,685
And what's nice is that it's pretty well
balanced with survival analysis you

352
00:18:34,685 --> 00:18:37,640
want to make sure you have enough events
and enough censored so

353
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,020
you now, one category sin too small and we
have a reasonable balance here.

354
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,760
This variable films, this was the number
of films that an actor or

355
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,500
actress has made in their career at least
up until 2001.

356
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,880
And you'll notice that that's a highly
right skewed variable.

357
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,780
This is the number of four star films.

358
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,010
And also highly right skewed, which makes
total sense because some people make

359
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,330
only a few films and there might be people
who make upwards of you know 290 films.

360
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:05,750
Just keep in mind it's a right skewed
variable.

361
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,220
The variable weins which the author has
had originally coded gave you

362
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,360
the number of times people had won, well.

363
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,890
You know, there are some people who have
won two or

364
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,550
three Academy Awards, but that wasn't,
that's very small person.

365
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,380
That wasn't really important for the
analysis that we were doing.

366
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,200
So, I just collapsed it, you either won or
you didn't won.

367
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,730
I already showed you how I made that new
variable.

368
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,600
Same with nominations then.

369
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,460
Nominations is pretty interesting that
some people have won, you know, 11 or

370
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,010
12 nominations.

371
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,000
But again for the purposes of this
analysis I just col,

372
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,020
collapsed into, you were nominated, or
your weren't nominated.

373
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,800
For first film year, this is the year that
somebody fist made a film,

374
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,150
it ranged from 1908 to 1998.

375
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,070
1998.

376
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,310
First win year was from 1928 to 2000.

377
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,650
First nomination year was from 1929 to
2001,

378
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,160
just good to keep in mind those dates.

379
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,380
Time here is, also, I could call age.

380
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,110
So, just make sure that the ages are
reasonable.

381
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,730
They range from about 13 to 104, and looks
fairly reasonable.

382
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,090
So, that just gives you a sense of all of
the different variables in your data set.

383
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,480
You would next want to deal with missing
data.

384
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,730
We don't have any missing data here.

385
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,642
So, you get out of that step for the
purposes of the mentor.

386
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,560
Your next one going to want to understand
you've looked now at the univariate

387
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,860
distribution, one variable at a time.

388
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,570
But you're next going to want to
understand,

389
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,710
how different variables related to one
another in your data set.

390
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,848
So, you want to explore simple
relationships.

391
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:37,390
And you might want to explore the basic
assumptions, kind of building towards

392
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,970
the fact that we're going to be doing Cox
regression here, for example.

393
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,080
So we can test some of the basic
assumptions of Cox regression.

394
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,830
So in this step, I'm going to look at just
what variables are related to each other.

395
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,400
You need to kind of understand which
variables are highly correlated.

396
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,710
Which variables go together.

397
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,080
I would do, just doing some basic
bivariate analyses.

398
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,180
And I'm also going to test here in just
one, kind of, one variable at a time.

399
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,520
Do we need proportional hazards and
linearity assumptions?

400
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,430
To explore what variables are related to
one another, a very simple, quick, and

401
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,610
dirty thing you can do is just to run a
correlation matrix on all of

402
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,780
the variables.

403
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,110
And to contain that a little bit what I
did in CAS was to say, to give me for

404
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,470
each variable in my data set the top three
variables that

405
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,850
are most correlated with that variable.

406
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,050
So, I asked for example, for gender.

407
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,510
What variables are most highly correlated
with gender?

408
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,180
And what my computer spit out was, the
number of four star films you have made,

409
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,350
the number of films you had made, and your
birth year.

410
00:21:34,355 --> 00:21:37,530
Well I could get this for all of the
variables in the dataset.

411
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,700
Asking for just the top correlations keeps
the matrix a little bit more readable.

412
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,000
And we can study this, and get a sense of.

413
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,760
What potential confounders, what things go
with what,

414
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,100
what things are highly overlapping.

415
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,910
So for

416
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,940
example it's interesting to note that the
men in this status that made more films.

417
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,460
That's probably because there were more
men in film early on.

418
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,740
They are getting more jobs than the women.

419
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,140
And remember, this data set traces back
you know, quite far.

420
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:12,080
And, other things that in-, int-,
interesting is that the men tend to have

421
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,950
earlier birth years, again that probably
has to do with the fact that early on,

422
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,980
there were probably were only mostly men
in film, so

423
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,390
their birth years tend to be earlier than
for the women.

424
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,862
So, just keep that in the back of your
mind.

425
00:22:24,862 --> 00:22:30,550
Birth year, is very highly correlated with
your year, the year of first film,

426
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,440
and the year of first nomination and the
year of first win.

427
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,640
Well that makes total sense.

428
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,190
Right?

429
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:40,520
If you were born in 1858, your first film
year is going to be much earlier,

430
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,100
than if you were born in 1980, because of
course you are hitting 20 or

431
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,370
30 years of age if you were born in 1858,
you're hitting, 20 or 30 years of

432
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,570
age in the, you know, the late 1800s and
even before there were films available.

433
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,230
But these are highly, highly correlated.

434
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,410
So you notice that first film year and
birth year have a correlation of 0.93.

435
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,300
Essentially.

436
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,670
Those variables are the s, are measuring
the same thing.

437
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,080
What that's going to tell me, is that I am
not going to bother putting first film

438
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,670
year, first nomination year, or first win
year as predictors in my model.

439
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,980
Because they're just, there so correlated
with birth year.

440
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,010
And birth year obviously is going to be a
good predictor of mortality and so

441
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,230
I'm just going to stick with birth year.

442
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,780
I'm pretty much going to ignore there,

443
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,259
these other variables for the rest of the
analysis.

444
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,490
We keep, the setting the more films you
make the more four

445
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,690
star films you're likely to make.

446
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,070
That makes sense.

447
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,860
The more films you make the, the earlier
you start in making films.

448
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,010
The correlation there is negative, that
makes sense.

449
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,340
The films you make the older you are
because the older you

450
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,350
are the longer time you've had to make
films.

451
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,360
A lot of these makes sense, but you can
look through these carefully and kind of

452
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,830
come up with things, you might not have
expected or might not have thought of.

453
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,800
I won't go through all of them.

454
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,860
I then went and did simple Kaplan Meyer
statistics on all of my predictors,

455
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,120
to see what variables are related to
death.

456
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,930
So starting with birth year, I'm expecting
birth year to be related to death and

457
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,060
indeed it looks pretty related to death.

458
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,900
So I broke birth year up into the lowest
26th percentile, the midi,

459
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,540
the middle 50th percent, and the highest
75th percentile.

460
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,980
Just to have something to plot on the
Kaplan-Meier curve.

461
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,054
However you break it up, it's going to
look pretty predictive.

462
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:16,690
The p-value from the log-rank test is
highly significant, and you

463
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,300
can see that indeed, if you were born in
later that's the gre, later years that's

464
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,340
the green line, versus if you were born in
the earliest years, that's the red line.

465
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,580
You definitely had worse you had better
survival if you were born later and

466
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,620
you have much more survival, if you're
born in the late 1800s.

467
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,240
That makes terrible sense, medicine has
changed of course.

468
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,800
Longevity has change.

469
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,500
also, gender is another one we would
expect to be a good predictor.

470
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,860
And men obviously, generally live less.

471
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,920
They have a less shorter expected lifespan
than women.

472
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,280
So in, I mean, that bears out in that
dataset.

473
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,450
If for some reason you did this analysis
and

474
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:58,830
that didn't bear out, that should be a
clue to you, that's somethings gone wrong.

475
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,180
Because women, we know, do live longer
than men.

476
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,340
And, indeed that bears out here.

477
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,690
That p value is highly significant.

478
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,760
So I know that probably, any final models
I build are going to include these two

479
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,365
predictors, because they're just at face
value, obviously related to mortality.

480
00:25:11,365 --> 00:25:14,370
[INAUDIBLE] explain some of the other
variables.

481
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,230
So if you were born in the USA versus born
somewhere else.

482
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,960
That also, if you're born in the US,

483
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,220
you do have a little bit of a survival
advantage.

484
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,140
It didn't quite reach statistical
significance in the log-rank test but

485
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,060
it does look like there's some difference
there.

486
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,039
Especially in the early years.

487
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,380
White race have,

488
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,340
there was only a very small few number of
people who were not white.

489
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,590
So you can see that the red line here, is
very, represents very few people.

490
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,750
But you can see there is some [INAUDIBLE]
survival advantages you might expect for,

491
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,398
for white, versus non white.

492
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:48,060
Again, the log-rank test doesn't quite
reach statistical significance,

493
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,470
because of the small sample size here.

494
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:56,170
They have this variable whether or not you
were in drama, the genre of drama or not.

495
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,216
Do you're actor in drama films?

496
00:25:58,216 --> 00:26:00,910
It did, you know, almost reach statistical
significance, but

497
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,820
you can see that the curves, the people
in,

498
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,660
in drama did slightly better in survival
than the people in other films.

499
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,500
There's a slight difference between those
two curves.

500
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,765
The drama being here.

501
00:26:09,765 --> 00:26:11,884
Non-drama.

502
00:26:11,884 --> 00:26:15,240
The difference between those curses are
pretty small though so

503
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,980
at most it will only have a small effect
on mortality.

504
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,560
Now very interestingly if you dump the
number of films and

505
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,078
the number of four star films, which of
course are related,

506
00:26:26,078 --> 00:26:29,780
into [INAUDIBLE] statistics, you see a
huge effect.

507
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,970
So I again, I just divided things for the
purposes of [UNKNOWN] into the lowest

508
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,380
26th percentile, the middle 50 percent,
and the highest 75th percent.

509
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,730
It doesn't really matter how you chop
those up,

510
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,440
as long as you have big enough categories.

511
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,849
So here are the people who made lots of
films.

512
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,420
The top 75th percentile.

513
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,940
These are the less films, the lowest 25th
percentile.

514
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,010
Well wow, you have a huge survival
advantage if you made a lot of films,

515
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,310
especially early on!

516
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,750
You were much more likely to live longer
right, so

517
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,190
those curves are really separated.

518
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,270
But what's going on there?

519
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,160
You have to think carefully about this
one.

520
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,330
So is it the fact that, if you make a lot
of films that somehow,

521
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:14,360
increases your longevity in that the films
cause you to live longer?

522
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,310
Of course, that's not the case, if you
think about this one carefully.

523
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,010
Right?

524
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:24,060
So what's happening here, is that in order
to be able to make 290 films or make

525
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,490
a lot of films over a career, you have to
live long enough to make that many films.

526
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,300
So we have an instance here of reverse
causality.

527
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,400
The longer you live, the more films you
can make.

528
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,880
So it's not that the films make you live
longer, it's the other way around.

529
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,940
Same with the four star films.

530
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,180
Both of those came out to be significant
in the log-rank test.

531
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:46,190
So we have to keep that in mind that, this
is,

532
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,880
most likely this artifact of reverse
causality.

533
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,670
I am not going to use these variables as a
result of,

534
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,310
as predictors in my model of mortality.

535
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,850
They're too confounded by this reverse
causality.

536
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,929
So I didn't do anything further with these
variables because of that.

537
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,380
And when I did the log-log plots, what you
see is kind of interesting patterns, and

538
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,950
a pattern that can tell you something.

539
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,670
So I did the log-log plots, for

540
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,950
this is the number of films, and this is
the number of four-star films.

541
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,080
And you get this kind of tell-tale
pattern.

542
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,170
So what you see is that the curves.

543
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,350
Start, at the beginning are far apart and

544
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:27,410
then they come closer and closer together
until they merge at the end of the plot.

545
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,560
The the end of the time.

546
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,960
Now remember, time here is age.

547
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,720
So, we're talking about ages on the x
axis.

548
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,680
So, what's happening here is.

549
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,160
This is a pattern that reflects reverse
causality.

550
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:44,170
What's happening here is that the people
who went on to make the most films they

551
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:48,860
have, they have a huge survival advantage
early on because it's like somehow ahead

552
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,040
of time, you know that they're going to go
on and make all of these films.

553
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,290
They have to survive long enough to do so.

554
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,670
So their not going to die.

555
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,880
Somebody who made 120 films probably
couldn't die when they

556
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,010
were 30 because they wouldn't have had
enough time.

557
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:05,130
So early on it look like they have a huge
survival advantage but later on,

558
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,660
they have very little survival advantage.

559
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,530
Because you now, once, even if you made 10
films but you made it to 70.

560
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:14,560
There's, you know, you've gotten rid of
that reverse causality at the later ages.

561
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,480
Everybody's made it that far, everybody's
lived that long.

562
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,960
So you see this kind of narrowing and
funneling, the plots all come together.

563
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,770
That's sort of a tell-tale sign that might
indicate reverse causality.

564
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:30,780
I then looked among the other variables
for violations of proportional hazards.

565
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,010
Now all of the variables so far that I've
been talking about,

566
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,078
are the ones that we're going to be
considering as potential con-founders.

567
00:29:37,078 --> 00:29:39,314
But if there's any con-founders that
really do,

568
00:29:39,314 --> 00:29:42,637
highly violate proportional hazard we're
going to want to consider that.

569
00:29:42,637 --> 00:29:47,260
So, I look for violations of proportional
hazard, so this is the birth year, and

570
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:51,234
I do see some violation of proportional
hazards with the birth year.

571
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:52,991
So this is Schonfeld residual plot.

572
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,873
You can see that there does seem to be-.

573
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:57,143
It kind of starts up here and then it
comes down.

574
00:29:57,143 --> 00:29:59,790
And it does seem to have some kind of
pattern over time.

575
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:03,710
The log log plots also sort of cross over
time.

576
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,880
There is, they don't look nice and
parallel and

577
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,940
birth year is a good predictor here.

578
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,010
So there does seem to be a violation of
proportional hazards with birth year.

579
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:16,020
That might make sense, because the
increase in your risk of your mortality,

580
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,160
going from, say, 1950 to 1951, in birth
year.

581
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,850
Might be very different than going from
1980 to 1981.

582
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:27,850
It's kind of, it would be kind of
surprising if that survival advantage.

583
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,810
For increasing your birth year was kind of
totally proportional and

584
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,390
totally constant over time.

585
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:41,550
Also for for born in the USA, the country
of birth, variable.

586
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:45,080
When I tested this one I saw evidence of
violation of proportional hazards.

587
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,130
So here's the Schoenfeld residual plot.

588
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,880
There's just a huge violation of
proportional hazards here.

589
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,450
It's clearly going down over time.

590
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:57,000
The log log plot is narrowing over time so
the two curves are coming together.

591
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,290
So there's pretty good indication of a
violation of

592
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,270
proportional hazards with this one.

593
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,440
This might have something to do with the
fact that if you were

594
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,739
born in a different country.

595
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,080
You know your, that,

596
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,020
that might have the most effect on your
survival early in your life.

597
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,920
And then eventually, if you're living in
the US, making films in the US for

598
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,830
a long time any differences due to your
birth country might wash out over time.

599
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,090
So, there's less of a difference as you
get older in, in your mortality risk.

600
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,740
But those are, I, I tested proportional
hazards for

601
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,059
all of the other variables and except the
main variables of interest.

602
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,530
And none of the other ones seem to have a
major violation of proportional hazards.

603
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,960
But birth year and born in the USA are
important enough,

604
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,230
that we're going to want to kind of
consider that violation later on.

605
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,880
There was only one continuous predictor
that I'm going to be really looking at,

606
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,550
at my data set, which is birth year.

607
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,780
That's the only one that I decided was I
need to move forward.

608
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,120
To further analysis.

609
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,260
So since I'm going to be doing Cox
proportional hazards regression,

610
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,160
I need to check whether or

611
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,278
not we are linear in the law of hazard
with this variable birth year.

612
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:07,800
So I did a Martingale plot on the left
here and

613
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,640
it looks like the line is nice and
straight.

614
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,930
Now, what's interesting is you'll notice
the scatter of dots down here,

615
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,058
you might wonder what that has to do with.

616
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,850
So this dot here represents for

617
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:21,980
example somebody who was born in 1899, and
they are still alive in 2001.

618
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,775
So there are 102 and still kicking and
they got huge

619
00:32:26,775 --> 00:32:30,290
Martingale residual because you'd expect
them to be dead by now given their age.

620
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,480
All of these other people also represent
people who were born,

621
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,260
this is their birth here on the x-axis, so
these are the people.

622
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,650
Here who were born in very early years in
this study,

623
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:45,470
you know, close to the 1900s and have
managed to live a long life.

624
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:51,410
They're, they've, given their law, their
high age, they're expected to have.

625
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,270
And their early birth years, they're
expected to have died by now but they're,

626
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,170
unexpectedly, they've had an unexpectedly
long life.

627
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,460
You get this pattern here because you had
to have been born,

628
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,070
this dataset ends in 2001, so you couldn't
have lived a whole century unless you

629
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,170
were born in say 1901 or earlier.

630
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:10,430
And so there aren't, there, some people
born in later years.

631
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,680
Haven't had the opportunity to live that,
so you get this kind of funny pattern.

632
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,060
But the, the general line fit to these
data points looks nice and

633
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:21,860
flat I also did a dummy plot where I
divided into this is

634
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,830
birth year again, I divided into decades
of birth.

635
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:29,440
Ad I fit a cor a Cox regression model.

636
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,000
With mortality as my outcome, and

637
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,150
I took the betas from the dummy-coded
decade, birth decades.

638
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:40,160
And then it looks like indeed it's a
reasonably straight line over time.

639
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,000
It's not perfectly straight, but it's
pretty good as real data go.

640
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,785
As you go up in birth years your mortality
goes down and down.

641
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:49,237
If, you get better longevity obviously if
you were born later.

642
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:54,119
Looks nice and linear.

643
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:58,955
So I'm not going to worry about,

644
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:04,931
I can model this birth year as linear.

645
00:34:04,931 --> 00:34:05,907
I then got to looking at some basic
descriptive statistics about the main

646
00:34:05,907 --> 00:34:06,771
variables we care about here which is the
winners, nominees and

647
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:07,329
controls, comparing those groups.

648
00:34:07,329 --> 00:34:09,054
This analysis in no way accounts.

649
00:34:09,054 --> 00:34:17,111
For the fact that people are changing
groups.

650
00:34:17,111 --> 00:34:19,899
So, this is very close to the original
analysis that the authors who published on

651
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:22,108
this paper in 2001, presented in their
original paper.

652
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:24,030
And, so what you'll notice is that indeed,
these are the people who won.

653
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,042
These are the winners.

654
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:29,390
These are the nominated-only group.

655
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,343
And it does indeed, look like there's a
survival advantage.

656
00:34:31,343 --> 00:34:34,429
The p-value is statistically significant.

657
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,323
This is exactly what the authors published
in that original 2001 paper.

658
00:34:39,323 --> 00:34:45,738
You have to think carefully, though, as
we've.

659
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:46,478
Talked about the,

660
00:34:46,478 --> 00:34:48,861
if you live longer that gives you more
opportunity to win an academy award.

661
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:50,511
If you die when you're 30,

662
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:54,202
you're probably not going to have a chance
to win an academy award.

663
00:34:54,202 --> 00:34:55,462
So we have another instance of reversed
causality and

664
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:56,594
you see that reflected in the log, log
plot.

665
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:02,208
So here's the log, log plot on the
right-hand side.

666
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:08,578
You can see that the curves look very
different early on and

667
00:35:08,578 --> 00:35:13,430
then they kind of merge together by the
end.

668
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,228
Somehow we know where basically we're
grouping people by whether or

669
00:35:15,228 --> 00:35:17,305
not they win from the day they are born,
and so we're, we essentially know that

670
00:35:17,305 --> 00:35:19,503
they're going to survive longer because
they had to survive long enough to win.

671
00:35:19,503 --> 00:35:24,178
And that's reflected in the log log quad,
this tells us we need to

672
00:35:24,178 --> 00:35:29,918
model this as a time changing predictor as
I've talked about in other modules.

673
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:31,871
Oh, we get the same basic pattern when we
look at winners versus controls,

674
00:35:31,871 --> 00:35:32,863
people who are never even nominated,

675
00:35:32,863 --> 00:35:34,412
highly significant, same problem, same
issue.

676
00:35:34,412 --> 00:35:36,733
interestingly, the nominees, those who
were only ever nominated.

677
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:43,007
Versus controls, we don't see much
difference.

678
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:46,541
So you don't, maybe there's not as much
reverse class because you can be

679
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:48,879
nominated as much kind of earlier in your
life.

680
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:51,084
A little bit of that same pattern in the
log log plot but

681
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:53,965
not a statistically significant difference
between those groups.

682
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:57,040
All right, so now I kind of understand
some basic relationships.

683
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,465
Basic assumptions that I'm going to need
to worry about when building my

684
00:36:01,465 --> 00:36:02,435
final model.

685
00:36:02,435 --> 00:36:07,554
Basic things that might be confounders and
that need to be included in that model.

686
00:36:07,554 --> 00:36:09,489
Before I start building a final model and
testing the main hypotheses of my study.

687
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:12,423
I'm going to make a descriptive table.

688
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:17,896
You're always going to need a table one in
your medical papers.

689
00:36:17,896 --> 00:36:19,259
So you might as well make that descriptive
table put it in

690
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:21,302
nice professional looking form with your
basic simple descriptive statistics.

691
00:36:21,302 --> 00:36:24,712
That can also help you to inform your
final model building.

692
00:36:24,712 --> 00:36:28,356
So here's the final descriptive table that
I came up with.

693
00:36:28,356 --> 00:36:30,977
The one that you got for your midterm
might look slightly different.

694
00:36:30,977 --> 00:36:33,265
But basically we're comparing.

695
00:36:33,265 --> 00:36:37,892
We want to compare winners, nominees, and
controls.

696
00:36:37,892 --> 00:36:40,237
For the purpose of this descriptive table
we're going to have to compare groups,

697
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:40,848
the static groups.

698
00:36:40,848 --> 00:36:43,262
There's not going to be anyway to account
for people changing groups.

699
00:36:43,262 --> 00:36:46,689
We're going to get our basic n's.

700
00:36:46,689 --> 00:36:52,643
Make sure to always include your n's in
your descriptive table.

701
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,976
And then I decided to present the data as
medians and

702
00:36:53,976 --> 00:36:55,752
interquartile ranges rather than means and
standard deviations.

703
00:36:55,752 --> 00:36:57,664
Primarily because I had a lot of right
skewed variables.

704
00:36:57,664 --> 00:37:00,005
And it seemed to me to just be more
informative.

705
00:37:00,005 --> 00:37:05,280
To use the median in their quartile range
here.

706
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,468
For categorical variables, I obviously
used ns and

707
00:37:06,468 --> 00:37:07,586
percents, as we would usually do.

708
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:08,538
so, you know?

709
00:37:08,538 --> 00:37:10,357
There's some interesting things.

710
00:37:10,357 --> 00:37:13,121
So male gender, for example.

711
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:19,428
Winners and nominees is pretty close to
50/50.

712
00:37:19,428 --> 00:37:24,748
That's because there's a category where
actresses get to win and

713
00:37:24,748 --> 00:37:29,587
there's a category for men so it is
reasonably even there.

714
00:37:29,587 --> 00:37:31,646
However for controls there are a few bit
more men there, 56% men vs 44% women so

715
00:37:31,646 --> 00:37:33,814
that's a little bit of a difference
between those two groups to keep in mind.

716
00:37:33,814 --> 00:37:37,555
Interestingly the controls were more
likely to be born in the US.

717
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,557
A few more foreign actors and actresses
were in the winners and nominees.

718
00:37:40,557 --> 00:37:44,669
Perhaps, that is because there is a
category for Foreign Films.

719
00:37:44,669 --> 00:37:49,278
Most of everybody is white, as we already
noticed.

720
00:37:49,278 --> 00:37:51,192
People, actors and actresses that were in
dramas were actually more likely to

721
00:37:51,192 --> 00:37:52,068
both be nominated.

722
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:54,307
And more likely to win.

723
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:57,281
So dramas, I guess, are.

724
00:37:57,281 --> 00:38:01,071
Dram, will get you a, a best actor or
actress nomination.

725
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,570
And win better than, you know, comedies,
and other types of films.

726
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,693
The birth years.

727
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:07,462
The percentages still living.

728
00:38:07,462 --> 00:38:08,842
Well, more of the nominees and winners are
still living.

729
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:12,618
Potentially that reverse causality again.

730
00:38:12,618 --> 00:38:15,185
Nominees and winners made more films than
controls.

731
00:38:15,185 --> 00:38:17,608
The more films you make, the higher chance
you have of winning and getting nominated.

732
00:38:19,152 --> 00:38:26,486
Winners made more four

733
00:38:26,486 --> 00:38:33,064
star films as well.

734
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:34,064
For the year of first film, the year of
first nomination and

735
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:35,304
the year of first win for the purposes of
the descriptive table I thought it

736
00:38:35,304 --> 00:38:36,564
would be easier to understand if I put
those in people's ages at first win,

737
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,413
age at first nomination and age at first
film.

738
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:39,327
As opposed to the years there, I thought
that was more informative so

739
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:40,083
I changed those to years.

740
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:42,846
So the winners had an average.

741
00:38:42,846 --> 00:38:44,533
Age of first film of 25, same with
nominees.

742
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:48,846
It was a little bit later for the
controls.

743
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:51,114
They got into the game a little bit later,
and

744
00:38:51,114 --> 00:38:52,987
only the winners got an age at first win.

745
00:38:52,987 --> 00:39:00,712
So you see, you, you, you weren't winning
until you're about 40, in your 40s.

746
00:39:00,712 --> 00:39:05,576
Where as you were nominated earlier in
life so

747
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:10,440
there's that difference and that you have
to

748
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,972
live longer in order to get to win an
academy award.

749
00:39:15,972 --> 00:39:16,902
Notice though, I didn't bother to put p
values in my descriptive value,

750
00:39:16,902 --> 00:39:17,607
one could argue that you could put the p
values in there,

751
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:18,567
I thought you could interpret this data
table without needing the p values,

752
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:19,504
if you put them in, it's fine, I just
decided I didn't need them there.

753
00:39:19,504 --> 00:39:20,526
The next thing we are going to do is we're
going to test the main hypotheses.

754
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:27,733
Do the winners.

755
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:30,901
Live longer than the nominees, do the
winners live longer than the controls,

756
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,830
do the controls do the nominees only live
longer than the controls?

757
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,904
We're going to use simple models and
graphics to start with, and

758
00:39:36,904 --> 00:39:39,402
just decide on how to model those main
predictors.

759
00:39:39,402 --> 00:39:40,302
I'm not even going to worry about building
a final model yet,

760
00:39:40,302 --> 00:39:41,325
just kind of start with the very simple
comparing those groups.

761
00:39:41,325 --> 00:39:44,160
Now I already showed you that we clearly
violate proportional hazards with

762
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,334
these variables, therein.

763
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:49,145
We can, if we just think about the
problem,

764
00:39:49,145 --> 00:39:53,754
there's gotta be reverse causality going
on here.

765
00:39:53,754 --> 00:39:58,110
So it's not correct to just model those as
static groups.

766
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,164
Somebody is not a winner from birth,

767
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:00,900
they're a winner from the time at which
they win that award.

768
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:07,632
So we know already that we're going to
need time changing.

769
00:40:07,632 --> 00:40:08,516
Variables here, so

770
00:40:08,516 --> 00:40:12,118
I'm going to need to model the winners and
the nominees as time changing variables.

771
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:15,126
You're in the control group until you're
nominated,

772
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:18,350
then you're in the nominee group until
you're a winner.

773
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,294
So for the first comparison that I wanted
to do just comparing winners versus

774
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,846
nominees, and not the controls.

775
00:40:22,846 --> 00:40:26,267
What we're going to do is we're actually
exclude anybody who's in control.

776
00:40:26,267 --> 00:40:29,253
So, we're going to exclude individuals
until their age of first nomination.

777
00:40:29,253 --> 00:40:31,737
We only want to compare nominees to
winners.

778
00:40:31,737 --> 00:40:33,230
So, if you haven't yet been nominated,
you're out of this analysis.

779
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,423
So, you're not included in the likelihood.

780
00:40:36,423 --> 00:40:40,719
So, I'm going to exclude people until
their age of first nomination.

781
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:43,298
And then, I'm going to treat people as
nominees until they win.

782
00:40:43,298 --> 00:40:45,772
So, some people will be nominated and
never go on to win.

783
00:40:45,772 --> 00:40:50,890
Some people will be nominated and go on to
win.

784
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:51,618
You're a nominee until you win,

785
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:52,818
if you never win you just stay a nominee
the whole time.

786
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:55,399
If you then win, you're treated as a
winner.

787
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:57,136
So, we're getting, we're going to put this
time changing predictors in.

788
00:40:57,136 --> 00:41:02,076
I've shown you the code here in sass.

789
00:41:02,076 --> 00:41:04,386
So basically I'm saying if.

790
00:41:04,386 --> 00:41:08,577
I made a new variable on your age at first
nomination.

791
00:41:08,577 --> 00:41:09,333
Your age at first win.

792
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,103
So age FN is your age at first nomination.

793
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:14,047
Age at first win is your age as age FW.

794
00:41:14,047 --> 00:41:16,298
So if the.

795
00:41:16,298 --> 00:41:17,467
My, I call the time variable.

796
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:25,646
That's your age here that, I called it
time.

797
00:41:25,646 --> 00:41:26,229
So if the time is before you're first
nominated, then for

798
00:41:26,229 --> 00:41:26,917
the, this new, this variable I'm naming is
winner, you get a dot.

799
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:32,562
That means missing data.

800
00:41:32,562 --> 00:41:35,208
You're not included, cause you're in the
control group, and

801
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:38,622
we only want to compare winners and
nominees, so we're excluded up until then.

802
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:39,966
Otherwise, if time is greater than or
equal to the age of first nomination,

803
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:41,287
you've now been nominated, but you don't
have an age at first win.

804
00:41:41,287 --> 00:41:43,820
That means you were never won.

805
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,391
Then of course, you, your, iswinner is 0.

806
00:41:46,391 --> 00:41:47,551
So if you were only ever nominated, you
never won.

807
00:41:47,551 --> 00:41:50,256
You wouldn't have an age of first win.

808
00:41:50,256 --> 00:41:53,423
Then you are not a winner.

809
00:41:54,463 --> 00:42:00,726
otherwise, if your age at.

810
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,855
If your, the current event time is after
you were nominated, but before you won.

811
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,133
Before your age of win.

812
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:13,661
Then you're still not in the winning
group.

813
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:14,919
However, if you have been nominated and

814
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:17,324
you also have won the time the current
event time is past your age of first win,

815
00:42:17,324 --> 00:42:19,120
now, now you're in the winners crap,
group.

816
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,194
And I also added in here, I'm only looking
at people who were ever nominated.

817
00:42:22,194 --> 00:42:24,487
So I excluded anybody who was only ever in
the control group.

818
00:42:24,487 --> 00:42:25,518
Obviously if you were only ever in the
control group.

819
00:42:25,518 --> 00:42:26,586
You never were nominated.

820
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:30,471
You never won.

821
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:36,394
So I just said where you were a nominee.

822
00:42:36,394 --> 00:42:37,455
This is only includes people who were ever
nominated.

823
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:39,043
When I ran this out my hazard ratio that I
get is 0.803.

824
00:42:39,043 --> 00:42:40,847
It doesn't quite make statistical
significance,

825
00:42:40,847 --> 00:42:42,664
although there is a little protective
factor here.

826
00:42:42,664 --> 00:42:46,254
Where winners seem to do a little bit
better.

827
00:42:46,254 --> 00:42:51,245
I use then the same logic to compare
winners versus controls.

828
00:42:51,245 --> 00:42:52,922
The difference here is that nominees are
treated as

829
00:42:52,922 --> 00:42:54,971
controls until they are nominated, then
they are excluded.

830
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:58,886
So I, I, I will actually want to exclude
the nominated group only.

831
00:42:58,886 --> 00:43:03,220
So you're, a control, up until the time
you're nominated.

832
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:07,987
If you're nominated but haven't yet won,
you're excluded from the analysis.

833
00:43:07,987 --> 00:43:09,142
However, if you then go on to be a winner,

834
00:43:09,142 --> 00:43:10,431
then you're brought back into the
analysis.

835
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:12,254
Winners also are treated as controls until
they are nominated, they're.

836
00:43:12,254 --> 00:43:13,904
Excluded until they win and then they are
treated as winners after they win.

837
00:43:13,904 --> 00:43:22,844
So I'm totally moving out the nomination
only category.

838
00:43:22,844 --> 00:43:26,159
And that code is accomplished with the
same kind of logic here.

839
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:30,408
So now I am comparing winners only, only
winners to controls.

840
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:31,962
I get a hazard ratio of 0.84, p-value is
about 0.12.

841
00:43:31,962 --> 00:43:33,219
Notice, I haven't adjusted for anything.

842
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:34,738
These are just my basic models.

843
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:36,906
Then I compare the nominees to the
control.

844
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,419
So this is, excluding anybody who is a
winner.

845
00:43:39,419 --> 00:43:41,903
So nominees are treated as controls until
they're nominated,

846
00:43:41,903 --> 00:43:44,299
then they switch groups and they're
treated as a nominees.

847
00:43:44,299 --> 00:43:48,134
The winners can be in the control group up
until the time they're nominated,

848
00:43:48,134 --> 00:43:52,146
then they're treated as nominees, but the
moment they win they're excluded,

849
00:43:52,146 --> 00:43:54,864
because I want to take the winners out of
this analysis.

850
00:43:54,864 --> 00:43:56,378
So, this could, accomplishes that.

851
00:43:56,378 --> 00:44:01,548
For this one, interestingly.

852
00:44:01,548 --> 00:44:06,960
The nominees versus the controls did a
little bit

853
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,523
worse in mortality just slightly above
one.

854
00:44:12,523 --> 00:44:13,139
Alright, so now I kind of have established
the basic

855
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:13,755
relationships, this is an explanatory
analysis so

856
00:44:13,755 --> 00:44:14,652
everything is around my mean hypothesis
that I'm trying to test.

857
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,151
I now need to build a final model
considering potential confounders.

858
00:44:17,151 --> 00:44:21,051
So I want to identify confounders,
possibly interacting variables.

859
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:24,777
And some of the variables even if their
not clearly confounders, I'm still going

860
00:44:24,777 --> 00:44:28,179
to include them in the final model just
for face validity like birth year and

861
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:31,219
gender probably no matter what those are
going in final model.

862
00:44:31,219 --> 00:44:32,983
I'm going to put these together in a final
model,

863
00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:34,500
I'm going to compare different models and.

864
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,868
See what effect that has on the point
estimate, the hazard ratio for

865
00:44:39,868 --> 00:44:41,908
winning verses nominees.

866
00:44:41,908 --> 00:44:45,998
So I will just kind of walk you through
what I did for winners verses nominees.

867
00:44:45,998 --> 00:44:51,070
I the process was the same for the other
two comparisons.

868
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:54,230
But, basically we started when there were
no covariates in the model, but

869
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:57,500
I modeled winners versus nominees as this
time-changing variable.

870
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,700
I got a hazard ratio of 0.80.

871
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,300
When I then added gender and

872
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,490
birth year to the model, because those are
such strong predictors.

873
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,130
I know that those are going to be in the
model.

874
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:10,180
They're also potentially confounders as
well.

875
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:15,130
When I, added them to the model it didn't
really budge my hazard ratio much.

876
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,710
It went up, it attenuated the effect just
a little bit.

877
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,980
So, now we're at a hazard ratio of 0.82.

878
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,580
Not a huge effect, I'm still going to keep
those in the model just for face validity.

879
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,470
And they do change the point estimate
slightly.

880
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:30,528
now, I then considered all of the other
predictors.

881
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:34,778
Again, I'm not going to put the number of
films in or the number of four star films.

882
00:45:34,778 --> 00:45:38,730
Because those are confounded by reverse
causality, I didn't bother with those.

883
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,340
I didn't put the year of first film,

884
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,120
because that's so closely tied to birth
year.

885
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,960
I tried all the other variables and so, so
things like whether or

886
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,470
not you were born in the U.S.A., whether
or not you're of white race.

887
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:53,510
White race didn't seem to be predictive,
it didn't budge the hazard ratio at all.

888
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:56,080
So I didn't end up in, including that in
the end.

889
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,040
I remember the fact that birth year and
born in the USA both showed violations of

890
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,500
proportional hazards in my earlier
analysis.

891
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,280
So I tried a couple of things to see
whether or

892
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,910
not accounting for that violation of
proportional hazards would have much of

893
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:14,690
an effect on the hazard ratio for winners
versus nominees.

894
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:20,660
So for example, I included born in the USA
birth year times time.

895
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,650
The interaction of birth year with time
and

896
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:25,680
the interaction of born in the USA times
time.

897
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,230
Those would account for the violation of
proportional hazard.

898
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,570
However, putting that in the model didn't
do a heck of a lot.

899
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:34,150
Now my hazard ratio is up to 0.83.

900
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,590
But it's still around the same.

901
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,370
Another way to account for the violation
of proportional hazards,

902
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:44,250
rather than putting a time by covariate
interaction in the model.

903
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,910
Would be to stratify on those variables.

904
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:50,590
Born in the USA is a pretty small
variable, so

905
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:55,270
I did try stratifying on that, it didn't
change the, anything too much.

906
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,150
When I stratified on birth decade I did
decades of birth,

907
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,999
you don't want to stratify necessarily on
each year.

908
00:47:00,999 --> 00:47:03,180
Because there won't be too many people on
each year.

909
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,840
So I stratified on birth decade.

910
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,720
Rather than putting it in the model.

911
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,740
And then I included your gender, whether
or not you were born in the USA.

912
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:15,170
And this born in the USA times time, I did
a couple of different versions of this.

913
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,760
And it really didn't matter whether I
stratified that born in the USA.

914
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,550
Whether I stratified on birth.

915
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:20,710
Whether I included them in the model.

916
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,480
Whether, whether I put the time
interaction.

917
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,960
Really none of this changed the point
estimate much.

918
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,170
Stratifying on birth decade, I got a
hazard ratio of 0.81.

919
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:31,850
So basically we're bouncing around
basically the same point estimate.

920
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,770
That's nice because it really doesn't
matter too much what you include in

921
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,364
that final model.

922
00:47:36,364 --> 00:47:39,430
the, the hazard ratio really doesn't
budge.

923
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:44,315
So then I ended up putting this together
in a final table where I

924
00:47:44,315 --> 00:47:45,700
show this process a little bit.

925
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,369
I show an unadjusted, a minimally adjusted
and a fully adjusted hazard ratio.

926
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:53,250
And I did this for the other two
comparisons, as well.

927
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,390
So here's what I came up with for my final
table of hazard ratios.

928
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:01,250
In the unadjusted model for winners versus
nominees, it was 0.8.

929
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,430
For winners versus controls, it was 0.84.

930
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:07,390
For nominees versus controls, it was 1.07,
as we already saw.

931
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:11,264
When I adjusted just for gender and birth
year I get 0.82, 0.87 and 1.09.

932
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:12,990
Again, not changing much.

933
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,220
None of these are statistically
significant.

934
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,700
When I did a fully adjusted model where I
counted, I counted for

935
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,010
these violations of proportional hazards
for birth year.

936
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:23,190
And included born in the USA and

937
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,610
the violation of proportional hazards
there it attenuated things.

938
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:27,820
Well they're pretty similar they're,

939
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,440
they're about the same, just a little bit
different.

940
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,820
So all of this is saying that basically
there does seem to be a slight

941
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:39,524
advantage for winners versus nominee being
those who are only nominated.

942
00:48:39,524 --> 00:48:44,270
But it's not statistically significant and
if it's there it's very small.

943
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:47,250
For winners versus controls it was even a
smaller advantage.

944
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,530
And interestingly for

945
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:50,890
nominees versus controls, it looked like
there was no advantage.

946
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:53,610
And again, none of these are statistically
significant.

947
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:59,480
So that was my sort of final model that I
presented as I mentioned there,

948
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,010
you probably will want, would want to for.

949
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,470
Most analysis do some sensitivity
analysis,

950
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,730
we might want to do some checks on this
model.

951
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,230
We can't check proportional hazards,

952
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,146
once we have a time changing variable in
the model.

953
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:13,830
So we've kind of already done that
proportion hazards checks ahead of time.

954
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,650
the, there's no graphics that we can come
up with that really model this well.

955
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,890
Because of the changing in groups of the
Kaplan–Meier curves don't really reflect

956
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:24,100
the changing groups.

957
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,020
So I didn't ask you to come up with any
final graphics, so

958
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,650
I, I, I had you kind of stop the midterm
at the final table.

959
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:32,560
And for the final example we'll, add some
of those steps such as

960
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,840
creating graphics that, that'll be part of
the final exam.

961
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,610
But that's a basic data analysis, sort of,
you can see a lot of

962
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:42,380
time gets spent on just basic data
cleaning and understanding the data.
