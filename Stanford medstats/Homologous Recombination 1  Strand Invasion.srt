00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,433
This video is going to review for you the
mechanism of homologous recombination.

2
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:19,620
Homologous recombination will actually
repair DNA double-strand breaks.

3
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,080
And here is a picture of a DNA
double-strand break.

4
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,720
And here is a picture of homologous DNA
that is going to be

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,170
used as the template for repairing that
double strand break.

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,060
And I'm going to be very careful about how
I draw this diagram because I'm going to

7
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:45,000
put in the five prime and three prime ends
of the DNA at every location.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,642
And, I've drawn with 5 prime and 3 prime
ends of

9
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:54,880
the homologous DNA in a way that will
allow the diagram to be very simple.

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,160
So, the first thing that happens after the
double strand break is created.

11
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,710
To send this down the pathway of
homologous recombination.

12
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,103
An exonuclease has to come along and

13
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:11,250
remove some of the DNA near the double
strand break, indeed,

14
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,100
what the exonuclease will do, is chew back
DNA to leave 3 prime protruding ends.

15
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,240
So I'm going to have my nuclease come in.

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,850
And create 3 prime protruding ends.

17
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,320
Then, after the 3 prime protruding ends
are created, one of the two, three prime

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:40,506
ends can then be used to hybridize the DNA
from the homologous chromosome.

19
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:41,420
So.

20
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,240
The homologous chromosome, which is drawn
in red,

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,140
then has to be partially denatured.

22
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,540
I'm going to draw it right here.

23
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,230
So here's the 5 prime and 3 prime ends.

24
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,790
Okay?

25
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,320
And.

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:07,950
[BLANK_AUDIO]

27
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,483
Some of the DNA here is displaced.'

28
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:13,550
Kay?

29
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,270
And there are proteins that allow this to
happen.

30
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,570
In fact, the protein that allows this to
happen is RAD51.

31
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:29,535
So here is the protruding, over here is
the protruding

32
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:34,530
3 prime over hang, and you can do strand,
what's called strand invasion.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,990
And, and it can invade the homologous DNA
duplex.

34
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:47,260
To displace one strand.

35
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,300
Now there is another strand of DNA from
the DNA double strand break.

36
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,239
And that strand I'm drawing right here.

37
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:10,110
Again, I'm going to keep track of the 5
prime and 3 prime overhangs.

38
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,680
All right.
So, now that strand invasion has occurred.

39
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,747
It has displaced some of the homologous
DNA,

40
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:20,606
the intact, from the intact chromosome.

41
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:25,807
And that is, that displacement forms a
structure that we call a D loop.

42
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:30,987
And the reason it's called a D loop is, if
you're falling asleep during this lecture,

43
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:35,901
your head will tilt 90 degrees, and you'll
suddenly wake up to see the letter D.

44
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:36,707
Okay.

45
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:40,389
Now that we've formed a D loop, DNA
polymerase can come along.

46
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,130
And at this point at this 3 prime
overhang,

47
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,460
it can begin copying the homologous DNA.

48
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:57,850
Similarly on the opposing strand, DNA
polymerase can copy the displaced DNA.

49
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,220
When this copying finishes,

50
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,700
ligase can bring the strands together on
the upper strand.

51
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,840
And when this copying gets to a certain
point, ligase can join.

52
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,950
And now what you have here is the
formation of two holiday junctions.

53
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,800
And this holiday junctions then need to be
resolved.

54
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,568
The reason this pathway has become very
important recently is because,

55
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:34,580
[SOUND] patients who have a hereditary
breast cancer,

56
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,320
because they have a mutation in either one
of two genes, BRCA1 or BRCA2.

57
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,820
BRCA1 or BRCA2.

58
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:47,260
If patients have, are carriers for
mutations in either of these genes,

59
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:55,740
they have a very high risk for getting
either breast or ovarian cancer.

60
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,940
Such patients have strong family histories
and the syndrome is

61
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,330
called Hereditary Breast and Ovarian
Cancer.

62
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,610
These genes are involved in homologous
recombination.

63
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,950
And their involvement in homologous
recombination is

64
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:22,405
to load RAD51 onto the protruding singe
strands, and

65
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:28,325
I'm going to draw some RAD51 molecules,
here's RAD51,

66
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:32,750
and here's the molecule, a little circle.

67
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,700
And these RAD 51 molecules.

68
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,750
Basically, facilitate the formation of, of
D-loop.

69
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,070
They facilitate stranded vision and
formation of the D-loop.

70
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,310
BRCA1 and BRCA2 work together to load
RAD51 onto

71
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,962
the protruding 3-prime overhangs.

72
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:54,462
So.

73
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,870
Tumors that arise in patients who have,
who are carriers for

74
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,710
mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2.

75
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,950
All of those tumors have knocked out both
alleles of BRCA1 or both alleles of BRCA2.

76
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,719
And as a result their tumors are defective
in homologous recombination.

77
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,060
And recent developments have now
introduced drugs that can potential be

78
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,190
used to treat breast cancer.

79
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:27,706
Because they actually make cells defective
that are defective in,

80
00:06:27,706 --> 00:06:33,280
homologous recombination particularly
susceptible.

81
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,820
While leaving, the patient's normal cells
alone because the patient

82
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,770
is heterozygous for mutation in
[INAUDIBLE] and so those cells,

83
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,120
those normal cells, have normal amalgamous
recombination.

84
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,140
Anyway, this is a very important pathway
and

85
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:54,570
I hope this has made the formation, of
these holiday junctions clear to you.

86
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,070
Thank you
