1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,260
In this question you are presented with a
hundred blood donors

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,380
with the following distribution of blood
types.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,106
The question is asking for the probability
that a random donor will have blood type

4
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:15,832
'AB' because the question doesn't specify
whether these donors are RH positive or

5
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:18,430
RH negative.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,460
We can conclude that there are going to be
4 donors out of 100.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,710
Were going to have blood type AB, or in
other words 4 percent.

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,140
So the answer here is A.

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,390
This question is asking us for

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,310
the probability of getting 3 sixes if we
roll 3 dice.

11
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:42,387
The probability of rolling one six with
one die is simply one out of six,

12
00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:51,310
and so with three die, that probability id
going to be one out of 216.

13
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:56,180
So, the answer here Is going to be b.

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,655
This question is asking us for

15
00:00:57,655 --> 00:01:01,790
the probability of getting a sum of eight,
if we roll two dice.

16
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,336
Okay, so this is a little bit more
involved but

17
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:09,428
basically the thought process behind this
is to think about all the different ways,

18
00:01:09,428 --> 00:01:11,170
in which you can get a sum of 8 and

19
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:18,560
because the numbers only range from 1 to
6, we have limited possibilities.

20
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,480
So, you can have 2 plus 6, or 6 plus 2.

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:31,220
You can have, 3 and 5 or 5 and 3 and
lastly you can have 4 or 4, okay?

22
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,650
So, that's out of a total of 36
possibilities, right?

23
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:42,423
So there are 6 total possibilities in each
die; you square that to get 36.

24
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:52,070
so, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5 possibilities out of
a total 36 possibilities.

25
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,010
And so we see that the answer is c.

26
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,570
So this question is asking us about the
probability Of

27
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,550
drawing a three card sequence exactly.

28
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,490
And this is from a standard 52-card deck.

29
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,730
It actually doesn't matter what three
cards they are for this question.

30
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,418
What you have to realize is that there's
only one way to get

31
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:18,015
that particular three card sequence.

32
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:22,990
And we have to calculate the number of
total possible three-card sequences.

33
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,180
So, because there's only one possibility,
1 goes in the numerator.

34
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,380
And the total number of three-card
sequences.

35
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,460
Well when you, before you pull your first
card, you have 52 cards available.

36
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,250
Okay, so it's 1 out of 52, essentially.

37
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,630
Then after you pull your first card, there
are only 51 cards left.

38
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,700
After you pull your second card, there are
only 50 cards, 50 cards left.

39
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,900
And so, your calculation becomes 1 over
the product of 52 times 51 times 50, and

40
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,740
so we see that the answer here is letter
D.

41
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,904
So, this question is asking us

42
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:07,275
about how many different 5-card
combinations are possible.

43
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:11,450
If you draw five cards from a standard
deck.

44
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,470
And the question specifically clarifies
that you do not care about order.

45
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,960
So in this situation, you can directly
apply the choosing function, okay.

46
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,355
The choosing function, the formula for
that is n factorial.

47
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:31,110
Over n minus r factorial times r
factorial.

48
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,892
Okay, so n factorial, the n here,

49
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:36,640
represents the total number of cards in
the deck.

50
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,020
So that's 52.

51
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,240
And you're pulling 5 cards from that deck.

52
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:47,566
So it's going to be 52 minus 5, or 47
factorial down here; times 5 factorial.

53
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:53,671
So n is 52 here; and you're choosing 5 out
of 52, so r is 5, okay?

54
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:58,460
So we see that the answer Is in fact
solution D.

55
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,180
This question reads: what's the
probability of

56
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:08,400
getting four fives in a row when you roll
a die four times?

57
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,210
Okay, so the thought process is that
there's only one way.

58
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,650
To get four fives.

59
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,410
So that's going to be in the numerator.

60
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,460
In the denominator you want to have the
total number of outcomes.

61
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,200
And because each die has six faces, you
have six choices each time.

62
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,310
Of course you're going to roll that that,
roll that die four times.

63
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,955
So it's going to be one over six raised to
the fourth.

64
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:42,110
4, or 1 over 1296; so we see that the
answer is c.

65
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,630
One other way of thinking about this,
right, is to,

66
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,270
is to take each die individually.

67
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,720
So if you roll a dice four times, you want
four 5s in a row.

68
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,798
There's only one five on each face, so
every time you only have a one in

69
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:59,710
six chance of rolling a five, and you're
going to do that over four times.

70
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,088
Again, this going to give you the same
answer, but

71
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:05,780
it's just another way of thinking about
the problem.

72
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,858
So this question reads: a randomized
crossover trial Involves four

73
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:10,180
interventions.

74
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,210
Each participant will get each of the four
interventions in random order.

75
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,555
How many possible orderings of
interventions are there?

76
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:20,949
So this is simply 4 factorial.

77
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:25,032
So 4 factorial is going to equal 24 and we
see that the answer.

78
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:25,908
Is B.

79
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:31,469
Now the reason this is 4 factorial might
not be immediately obvious at first,

80
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:34,540
but basically the question is asking for

81
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:40,780
the possible orderings of 4 different
interventions.

82
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,867
So basically imagine you have intervention
A, intervention B, intervention C,

83
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:46,790
and intervention D.

84
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,704
Right?
So it's asking us

85
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:50,520
How many ways can you order these four
letters.

86
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:57,690
So when you first your intervention here,
or your letter, you have four choices.

87
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,910
So I'm going to put 4 here.

88
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,378
Then after you pick your first one Whether
it's D or not,

89
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:06,320
you have three choices left.

90
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,720
So you're going to pick, I'm going to put
three here.

91
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,170
And so you can see if I follwoed that
logic,

92
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,880
I'm going to result in this expression 4
times 3 times 2 times 1,

93
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,160
which is simply the same thing as four
factorial.

94
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,046
So this question reads when you draw three
cards from a standard 52

95
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:29,430
card deck What's the chance that you will
get a three-of-a-kind?

96
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,353
Okay.
So, this is a little confusing at first,

97
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:34,080
but let's break the problem down into
pieces.

98
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,735
So, the first thing I'm going to do is to
think about what I

99
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:39,340
want to be in the fraction.

100
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:39,870
Okay?

101
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,395
So, In the top i-, in the numerator rather
I want to

102
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:49,380
have the different number of
three-of-a-kind hands, okay.

103
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,010
So, all, all sort of the, the winning
hands are getting three-of-a-kind.

104
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,018
And then the denominator I want the total
possibility of

105
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:59,650
three-card combinations, okay?

106
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,950
So the denominator is going to be 52
choose 3; that's saying,

107
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,660
I choose 3 cards from a 52-card deck.

108
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,470
And that's going to be all the possible
three-card combinations, OK?

109
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,818
And so that's going to equal 22,100.

110
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:21,040
Now let's think about the numerator depth.

111
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,132
So, for each type of card, of which there
are 13 types,

112
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:33,000
right, there's 4 choose 3, so 4 ways that
you can get a three-of-a-kind.

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,570
So there are 4 times 13 or 52 different
three-of-a-kind hands.

114
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:48,795
So then the fraction becomes 52 over 22100
Or answer choice C.

115
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:52,931
Okay, so this question reads: a certain
lottery works by

116
00:07:52,931 --> 00:08:00,320
picking five lucky numbers from 1 to 47
and one MEGA number from 1 to 27.

117
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,780
You only win if you match all 6 numbers.

118
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,687
Okay, so basically, You have a condition
for the first 3 numbers, and

119
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:08,510
then a new condition for the last number.

120
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,140
So that's one way of thinking about it.

121
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,236
So how many possible combinations are
there for

122
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:18,810
the first part of picking 5 numbers?

123
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,546
So that's going to be simply 47 Choose
five, which is equivalent to one and

124
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:25,890
a half million.

125
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,250
About, basically.

126
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,650
Okay so there are one and a half million
possible five number combinations for

127
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,335
the lucky numbers.

128
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:35,078
Then each of these right,

129
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:39,809
each of these five each of these
combinations, each of these five

130
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:48,270
numbers can be combines with one of 27
different numbers from that mega number.

131
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:53,440
So the total number of ways to win is 27
times this number, 47 Choose 5, okay.

132
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,007
And that works out to be

133
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:05,820
about 41,416,353.

134
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,802
So, how many ways are there to win?

135
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:09,590
Only one.

136
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,770
So, this is your answer.

137
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,180
And that corresponds to answer A.

138
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:19,708
So, this problem introduces the at least.

139
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:24,358
Type problem, and just as a review, for at
least type problems, the key is to

140
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:29,308
realize that the probability of at least,
of the event happening at least once,

141
00:09:29,308 --> 00:09:37,223
is equal to 1 minus the probability of it
not happening at all, not at all.

142
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:38,089
Okay.

143
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:41,003
So, the question reads if a couple has
five children,

144
00:09:41,003 --> 00:09:45,110
what's the probability that they have at
least one boy?

145
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,374
Again, and so you're clued in to this fact
that it's an at-least type problem,

146
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:51,150
because of the wording in the question.

147
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,328
What's the probability that they have at
least one boy?

148
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:58,068
So this probability is represented by the
probability of having,

149
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:02,990
of doing 1 minus the probability of no
boys at all, right?

150
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:12,298
So, that's equal to doing 1 minus and, you
know it's 0.5 1 minus 0.5 raised to the 5.

151
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:16,770
so, and it's raised to the 5 because the
couple has five children.

152
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:21,159
So you do 1 minus 0.5 raised to the 5th
and

153
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:28,240
that works out to be 0.969 or about 96.9%.

154
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,115
So answer choice d is the correct answer.

155
00:10:30,115 --> 00:10:36,487
In this next problem we're given a
situation where the probability

156
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:46,189
of some situation B is 0.75, and a
probability of some situation A is 0.2.

157
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:51,900
And then we're given this joint
probability of A & B as 0.1.

158
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,930
And we're being asked if A and B are
independent connect or not so, if 'A' and

159
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,146
'B' are independent then the probability
of A happening times the probability of

160
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:05,180
'B' happening is equal to this joint
probability.

161
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,040
Okay, so we can check whether they are
independent or

162
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,095
not by multiplying Point seven five times
point two,

163
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:17,000
which works out to be point one five,
which is not equal to point one.

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,710
So we say that they are not independent.

165
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,680
The correct answer in this case is A.

166
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,298
This question reads.

167
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:30,380
Suppose that 15% of the population is
exposed to some dangerous chemical Z.

168
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,330
So, if you're not exposed to Z,

169
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,760
you have a lifetime risk of some bad thing
happening of .0001.

170
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,200
And if you are exposed to Z Your lifetime
risk increases fourfold to .0004.

171
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,362
So, what percent of the population will
develop this really bad thing, and

172
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:50,380
this problem is pancreatic cancer.

173
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,528
And so, the way of doing this is to just
calculate, and use the law of

174
00:11:54,528 --> 00:12:01,180
total probability, which is just a fancy
way of saying Weight the percentages.

175
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,497
So, if 15% are exposed and their risk,

176
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:12,950
right is .0004, you want to add that to
the 85% of the population.

177
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,240
Where their total risk is 0.0001, right?

178
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,595
And just add these two to get the overall
risk in the overall population, and

179
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:25,460
this works out to be .000145.

180
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,400
So the correct answer here is answer
choice d.

181
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,676
This next question presents us with a
similar situation.

182
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:38,334
So 15% of the population is exposed, which
means 85% are not.

183
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:41,462
Those that are exposed have an elevated
risk of .0004 of

184
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:44,330
developing pancreatic cancer.

185
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:50,450
Those who are not exposed have a, a
fourfold lower risk of .0001.

186
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,870
The question is specifically asking if
someone develops pancreatic cancer,

187
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,045
what is the chance that he or she was
exposed to Z?

188
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:03,917
So, this is probably easiest illustrated
through A diagram so

189
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:07,548
there are two branches here.

190
00:13:07,548 --> 00:13:12,420
You can either be exposed to chemical Z or
not exposed.

191
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:18,980
So, your probability to exposure is 15%
and probability of non-exposure is 85%.

192
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,760
If you're exposed, right.

193
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:27,080
So, if you're exposed, the probability of
developing disease is 0.0004.

194
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,890
If you're not exposed, the probability of
developing disease is .0001.

195
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,633
And I'm just going to subtract to fill out
this branch and

196
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:43,960
this branch and basically just going to
subtract by 1.

197
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,570
So this branch is going to be 1 minus.

198
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,408
Point 04 and this branch is going to be 1
-

199
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:55,150
0.0001 because that's the probability
that's left over.

200
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,132
So, another way of thinking about that is
that,

201
00:13:58,132 --> 00:14:02,970
these probabilities have to sum to 100 at
every juncture.

202
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,844
So, if I multiply this out I get 0.00006
here.

203
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:13,928
And if I multiply this out, on the bottom
I get .000085.

204
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:17,500
[COUGH]. Okay? And these are what we're
interested in

205
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:25,509
because ultimately what we want to do
right remember is to calculate.

206
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:29,226
The probability that a person was exposed
to chemical Z given that he or

207
00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:32,210
she develops pancreatic cancer.

208
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,837
And the fact that she this person he or

209
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:40,825
she develops pancreatic cancer is
represented by these 2 probabilities.

210
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:42,840
Okay.

211
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,920
So, the probability of disease given
exposure,

212
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,309
which is this over the probability of
disease when you're not

213
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:57,030
exposed plus the probability of disease
When you're exposed, right.

214
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,890
So that's going to be the sum of both of
these numbers.

215
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:08,440
So this is the expression that we are
interested in.

216
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,178
And this is equal to 41.

217
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,026
0.4%.

218
00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:15,014
So if you have pancreatic cancer,

219
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:20,216
there's a 41.4% chance that you were
exposed to this bad chemical.

220
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:25,316
So in this question we're given a
fictitious probability of

221
00:15:25,316 --> 00:15:29,826
event B which is point seven five.

222
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,230
We're given a fictitious probability for
event A, which is point 2.

223
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,430
Then we are also given a probability for A
and B.

224
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,050
This joint probability of point 1.

225
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,630
Okay, and the question's asking what is
the probability of A given B.

226
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,790
Well, the probability of A given B,
there's a formula for this.

227
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,880
You can do the probability of A and B over
probability of B.

228
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,050
Think about it, as dividing out.

229
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,690
This probability of B.

230
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,818
And so that of course is equal to 0.1
divided by 0.75 and

231
00:16:04,818 --> 00:16:11,870
that is equal to 0.133, and so the answer
in this case is answer A.

232
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:19,230
In this question, we're given a, a few
clues.

233
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,578
And we're being asked to select the
correct statement about sensitivity,

234
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:26,275
specificity and positive and negative
predictive values.

235
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:28,730
So, let's read the question first.

236
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,426
So, in a group of patients presented at
the emergency room with ankle pain 30% of

237
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:34,565
them have a fracture.

238
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:37,575
60% of patients with a fracture are older
than 55 and

239
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:42,450
30% of patients without a fracture are,
are older than 55.

240
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,650
So what this kind of information
immediately lends itself to is

241
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,523
making contingency table or a 2 by 2.

242
00:16:50,523 --> 00:16:53,843
Because we're dealing in percentages we
could just.

243
00:16:53,843 --> 00:16:59,640
Make up a baseline number of patients at a
100; this is going to make things easier.

244
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,830
So we're told that 30% of patients
presenting with ankle pain have

245
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,190
a fracture.

246
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,075
So you make this row Fracture, and this
row No fracture.

247
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:14,890
30% of 100 is 30, which makes this row 70.

248
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:20,749
Now the columns are going to be Age let's
just make this greater than 55,

249
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:27,020
and we can make this less than or equal to
55.

250
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,905
Okay, so next part.

251
00:17:28,905 --> 00:17:34,000
60% of patients with a fracture Are older
than 55.

252
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,800
So of, of the three patients that
comprised these two cells,

253
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,150
sixty percent lie in the top right cell,
okay?

254
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,615
So .6 times 30 is going to equal the
number in this cell,

255
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:48,550
which is going to be 18.

256
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,222
That automatically makes this one 12.

257
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:54,210
Then the next clue, 30 percent of patients
without a.

258
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,762
Fracture are older than 65.

259
00:17:56,762 --> 00:18:02,470
So 30% of 70 is going to be the number in
this cell, and that's going to be 21.

260
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:07,100
Which is going to make this cell 49 just
by subtraction.

261
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:13,340
Then when I add vertically, to fill out
this 2 by 2.

262
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,762
So once we have this 2 by 2 setup we're
basically basically done with

263
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,420
the question.

264
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:24,300
So, looking at this 2 by 2 you can
calculate the negative predictive value.

265
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,108
Now your predictive value of course is,

266
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:32,230
the number of true negatives, over testing
negative.

267
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,251
Okay so basically of all the people who
tested negative how many were

268
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:39,435
actually negative, that's what this is
getting to.

269
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:42,380
So that's going to be 49 over 61 [SOUND],

270
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:47,970
which corresponds to answer d in our
question.
