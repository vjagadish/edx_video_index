2
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:08,840
In this next module I'm going to talk
about the issue of missing data.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,883
So, if you have missing data, if you
didn't get

4
00:00:12,883 --> 00:00:17,660
that repeated outcome measured at every
time point, what's going to happen?

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,060
So if you're working on analyses that use
the broad form of the data.

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,550
So literally when you put them into your
computer package, it's running, and

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,100
it only runs in the broad form of the
data, then any subjects we're missing,

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,280
even data on just one time point out of
all the time points.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,900
They're going to be completely omitted
from that analysis unless you

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,540
impute those missing data points.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,440
And so this would be things like the
simple meas-, the simple strategies for

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,720
analyzing repeated measures, data that I
have talked about.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,970
ANCOVA, also repeated measures ANOVA, as
we'll see.

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,430
Those are going to throw somebody out
unless they have all of

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,450
the time points measured, or you do
imputation.

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,410
So that's a little bit of a limitation of
those methods.

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,815
You're going to have to do some
imputation.

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,820
However, if you're working on analyses
that used a long form of the data,

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,070
it turns out that that, those analyses are
only going to

20
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,560
omit specific time points when a person
wasn't measured.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,274
So if a person was measured at time point
one, two, and

22
00:01:18,274 --> 00:01:22,498
four, but not time point three, they won't
contribute to time point three.

23
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:26,280
But they will contribute to time points
one, two, and four.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,910
And so the more sophisticated analysis
like GEE and

25
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,280
mixed models will handle missing data in
that way.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,840
And also that slope analysis I told you
about earlier,

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,680
actually that handles missing data as
well.

28
00:01:37,356 --> 00:01:40,680
So just to illustrate why this is, take
here,

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,110
here's the broad form of the data, and
here's the long form of the data.

30
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,470
This is just some data we had on spine
bone density.

31
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,550
And take for example subject number 25.

32
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,660
In the broad form of the data, she has
spine one and

33
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,920
spine two, but not spine three.

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,830
If I go to run a repeated measures ANOVA
on these data, because she's missing,

35
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,380
this row of data is missing one time
point,

36
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,000
it will not be included in the repeated
measures ANOVA.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,220
She will just be completely kicked out of
that analysis.

38
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,660
However, if you turn to, and look at the
long form of data,

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,130
the same id number, 25, she now has three
rows in the long form of the data.

40
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,150
She has a spine value for on-, for her
first time period and

41
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,180
her second time period, again missing that
third time period.

42
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,510
But, analyses that run on the long form of
the data will be able to

43
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,410
include this row in the analysis, and this
row.

44
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,500
And the only row that will get kicked out
is this row.

45
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,180
So, she will only be left out when it
comes to the third time point.

46
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,210
The one she actually missed, as opposed to
all time points.

47
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,060
So that's the advantage of the analysis
like GE in mixed models that run on

48
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,190
the long form in the data.

49
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,950
Now let's say that you want to work on the
broad form of the data and

50
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,940
you need to fill in that missing data.

51
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,640
What's a way that you can impute the
missing data?

52
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,690
So for repeated measures data, a very
simple way to

53
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,950
impute missing data is to use what's
called Last Observation Carried Forward.

54
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,200
And that's a very nice name because it's
exactly what it sounds like.

55
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,611
So here's a little bit of an example data
set.

56
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:11,731
There's just four subjects here, they all
have depression scores and

57
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:13,790
at time points one, two, three, and four.

58
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,220
And you can see that subject one was
missing the final two time points.

59
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,410
Last observation forward, carry forward,

60
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,780
we'll just carry the last observation
forward.

61
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,578
So she's missing time point three,

62
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:27,914
we're going to carry forward there the 13
from time point two.

63
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:29,434
And then she's missing the time point
four, so

64
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:31,570
we'll carry forward that 13 again.

65
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,380
In this way, we have now filled in all of
her values, so

66
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,540
she will not be kicked out of the
analysis.

67
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,020
And it seems pretty reasonable, since the
last time we saw her she was at 13,

68
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,380
to fill in the rest of the time points
with 13.

69
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,240
That's a much better thing than dumping
her out of the analysis completely.

70
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,220
Down here at subject four we just carry
the 30 forward.

71
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,350
She missed only the second time point.

72
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,560
Since we need to fill in something for

73
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,800
the time point, we'll, second time point,
we'll carry forward that value of 30.

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,200
So Last Observation Carried Forward is
easy to implement,

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,500
it's easy to understand, and it does a
pretty good job.

76
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,550
Again, it's much better to fill in just
something on those missing data

77
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,950
points than to have the person kicked out
altogether.

78
