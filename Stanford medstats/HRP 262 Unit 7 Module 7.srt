1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,150
In this next module we are going to do a
little practice on

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,870
repeated measures A.N.O.V.A. to make sure
that you understand the difference between

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,290
the group effect, the time effect and the
time by group interaction.

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,566
[BLANK_AUDIO]

5
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:19,590
So what I'm going to have you do in this
module is I'm going to show you a couple

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,640
of pictures and I'm going to ask you to
pause the video in just a second here.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,380
Which of these do you think, which of
these effects do you think?

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,840
Would be statistically significant
assuming that we kind of have

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,070
reasonable sample sizes in you know, sort
of a moderate sample size in each group,

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,900
we do expect the time effect to be
significant and

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,700
what I'm showing you here is that the
black line is group A, one group,

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,035
the red line is group B, and you can
assume that we have more than you know,

13
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:49,180
three people in each of these groups,
again a reasonable sample size.

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,550
Do you think that the time effect is going
to be significant for this data set?

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,950
Do you think the group effect is going to
be significant and

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,650
do you think the time by group effect is
going to be significant?

17
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,710
So I actually want you to pause the video
and figure out your answer on all of

18
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,089
those and then restart the video and then
I'll walk you through it.

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,920
So, hopefully on this one, you said that
the time effect would be significant.

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,760
So if you average over groups, over the
red and the blue groups, it does seem that

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,290
even averaging in the grou the b group,
which doesn't change that much over time,

22
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,550
that you would still have some downward
trend here.

23
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,460
So the time effect is going to be
significant here, you know,

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,700
assuming a reasonable sample size.

25
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,990
Is there any significant difference
between group?

26
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,220
Interestingly on this one, if you average
all four time points for

27
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,740
group A and all four time points for group
B, the.

28
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,380
They're going to be about the same.

29
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,410
So group A on average because it started
higher but

30
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,210
ended lower, is not going to be on average
different than group B.

31
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,140
So there will not be a significant group
effect here.

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,610
There will be a significant time by group
effect,

33
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,870
because clearly group B seems to stay flat
over time, whereas group A goes down.

34
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,930
So there will be a significant group by
time.

35
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,190
Effect.
[BLANK_AUDIO]

36
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,900
Alright.

37
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,370
Again, I want you to do the same thing.

38
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,160
Black line is group A.

39
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,060
Red line is group B.

40
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,830
Same thing.

41
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,490
Pause the video and see which one of these
you think would

42
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,960
be statistically significant with a
reasonable sample size.

43
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,780
Alright, so with this one,

44
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,550
hopefully you realize that the time effect
is not going to be significant because it

45
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,710
doesn't look like either group is really
changing much over time.

46
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,560
However, the group effect is going to be
significant because

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,030
the red group is clearly, group B is
clearly higher than group A throughout.

48
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,590
And then finally the time by group effect
is going to

49
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,520
be nonsignificant because they're again
both, they're both flat over time.

50
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,870
So essentially the changes over time are
the same pattern in group A and group B.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,750
So finally I want you to pause the video
one more time and.

52
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,130
See if you can figure out which of these
effects is going to be significant for

53
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,430
this graphic, for these data.

54
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,720
So, for this one hopefully you realize
that the time effect is

55
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,260
clearly significant because if you average
over the two groups they're

56
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,760
definitely going down on average.

57
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,700
The group effect here is not going to be
significant because, you know,

58
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,880
if you were averaging all the red time
points and

59
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,590
all the black time points, it looks like
they're going to be fairly similar.

60
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,570
And the time by group effect is also not
going to

61
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,330
be statistically significant here.

62
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,180
The black group does go down just.

63
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,670
Slightly more than the red group.

64
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,250
But unless we have a huge sample size
since they're both generally going

65
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,970
down over time, we'd have to have a really
big sample size for that time by group,

66
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,670
that little difference to come out to be
statistically significant.

67
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,610
So hopefully you were able to get all of
those without too much trouble.

68
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,399
