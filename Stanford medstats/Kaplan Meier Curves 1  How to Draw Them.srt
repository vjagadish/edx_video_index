1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome students.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,517
This is the video K-M Part 1: How to draw
Kaplan-Meier curves.

3
00:00:06,517 --> 00:00:07,511
K-M stands for Kaplan-Meier.

4
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:12,271
Of course, you're very unlikely to need to
draw Kaplan-Meier curves yourself, and

5
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:15,985
certainly the software programs do this
for you given the data, but

6
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:20,483
you need to know how the data are actually
converted into a Kaplan-Meier curve and

7
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:24,240
to, in order to truly understand what a
Kaplan-Meier curve does.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,470
So we're going to take you through it.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,470
I hope you're not too nervous,

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,200
the math won't be too hard because we're
only going to do a small clinical trial.

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,260
So here's our clinical trial, the clinic
trial is a study in

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,540
which we're interested in the survival
after surgery for pancreatic cancer.

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,600
And what kind of survival are we talking
about?

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,980
We're talking about overall survival.

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,300
We're, we're not going to ask why the
patient died.

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,760
We're only going to ask is the patient
alive or dead?

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,490
And we're going to measure it in time.

18
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,360
And it just so

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,560
happens that our measurement in time will
be over the course of months,

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,310
because pancreatic cancer is a pretty
dismal tumor and lots of people die.

21
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,278
So here we go.

22
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:13,020
Now, [COUGH] what we're going to do is
we're going to

23
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,150
start enrolling patients with the first
surgery I perform as a surgeon but

24
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,590
I don't operate on ten patients all on the
same day.

25
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,400
The patients will get operated on in a
spaced out way.

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,650
And I may not be willing to wait until
every last

27
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,810
patient has died before I write my paper
up because I may have

28
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,860
some interesting results that I want to
share before that point.

29
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,880
And in the case of some clinical trials
which,

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,920
in which you were going to measure
survival in say five years, you don't, and

31
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,070
you're accumulating the patients over a
five year interval.

32
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,750
You don't want to wait ten years before
you publish it.

33
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,230
Because if you started the trial on year
one and you enrolled the patients for

34
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,800
the next five years,

35
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,790
you're going to have to wait at least ten
years before you can analyze it.

36
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,740
So Kaplanâ€“Meier is a way of getting around
that.

37
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,540
And also it, you'll, as you'll see,

38
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,330
it's a way of dealing with incomplete
information in a very clever manner.

39
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,320
So here's our clinical trial.

40
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,780
We've got 10 patients, and the first

41
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,680
interval that we're interested in looking
at is interval from zero to one month.

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,530
And the reason we're going to look at the
interval from zero to one

43
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,290
month is two patients happen to die at the
end of that interval.

44
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:37,810
So during that interval from zero to one
month, no patients were censored,

45
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,470
we'll talk about censoring later, and we
did talk about it in class.

46
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,983
But at the enter to the interval there
were ten patients left and

47
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:48,694
there were two deaths.

48
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:50,445
Okay?

49
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:58,650
So, at the very beginning of course,
Kaplan-Meier curve shows 100% survival.

50
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,310
At the end, two patients died.

51
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,200
So the curve is going to come down a
certain amount.

52
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,941
And one patient, one patient died

53
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:13,700
from surgical complications, from surgery.

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,650
And one died, from complications of the
pancreatic cancer.

55
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,080
It does kill very quickly.

56
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,580
Okay.

57
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,280
And as a result, the curve will drop down.

58
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,290
Now, how much will the curve drop down?

59
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,080
Well, at, at this point that we're talking
about,

60
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,440
there are ten patients at risk and two
died.

61
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,279
So, two out of ten patients died.

62
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:51,040
And the percent surviving is eight out of
ten.

63
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,754
So, the percent surviving is 80%.

64
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,500
All right, good.

65
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,520
So, we've got 80% and now we follow that
out.

66
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:06,440
The next interval will be from one month
to four months.

67
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,750
Now, it turns out in that interval nobody
died.

68
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,100
The reason we pick one to four month is
because there was one death

69
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,520
at the end of that interval.

70
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,310
But several other things happened.

71
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:24,310
Now at this point,

72
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:30,770
at the two month mark, one patient showed
up to clinic at the two-month part,

73
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,930
but never came to clinic again.

74
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,060
And we don't know what happened to them.

75
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,590
We made phone calls and so on.

76
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:42,550
So that patient is lost to follow-up, lost
to follow up, all right?

77
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:48,870
We can't say whether or not that patient
lived or died after two months.

78
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,190
Our information's incomplete.

79
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,140
However, we do know that that patient did
not die up two month mark, and

80
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,190
that's valuable information.

81
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,898
So we don't want to throw that patient
out.

82
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:05,754
[COUGH] In addition, we'll have another
patient here.

83
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:07,119
Okay?

84
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:13,239
Who entered the study three months ago.

85
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:20,275
Enrolled three months ago.

86
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:21,960
Okay, we're writing the paper now.

87
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,800
But we did the surgery three months
before.

88
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,220
So that patient we know survived after
three months, but

89
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,410
we're not willing, willing to wait longer
before something happens.

90
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:38,860
All we know is that patient still at the
three month mark, was still alive.

91
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,182
We don't know anything after that.

92
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:44,980
And you'll notice that at the beginning of

93
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,850
the study we had eight patients left,
okay, and four were censored.

94
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,860
One lost a follow up, one that enrolled
three months ago, and

95
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,820
another one that enrolled three and a half
months ago.

96
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,265
And say, another patient lost to
follow-up.

97
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:00,852
Okay?

98
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:03,195
Some censoring events.

99
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:05,960
Now, of course, lost a follow-up and so

100
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,463
on they tend to get lost to follow-up as
you get further and

101
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:16,110
further out, because say, this one, this
one wasn't really lost to follow-up.

102
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,740
This one may have I mentioned very
quickly, that this one enrolled-

103
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,320
[BLANK_AUDIO]

104
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,818
Three and a half months ago.

105
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:30,203
[BLANK_AUDIO]

106
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:35,614
This one moved to England.

107
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:37,428
Okay?

108
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:40,770
This patient knew she had pancreatic
cancer and

109
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,040
wanted to move to be closer to her family.

110
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,700
She had, she had children who had moved to
England, and she wanted to move there too.

111
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,510
But because we saw her at this point, but
never saw her again, and

112
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,840
really she, she was no longer in any
communication.

113
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,080
We don't know what happened to her, she's
also censored.

114
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,140
Now at this point at the end of this
interval from one

115
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,010
to four months there are four patients at
risk.

116
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,430
One dies.

117
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:18,087
So, the survival at that point is three
out of four patients were still alive for

118
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:20,240
75% survival at that interval.

119
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,625
So from this point down we have to have
75% of 80%, or 60%.

120
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:31,710
So, at that point we have 60% survival.

121
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:37,694
And this patient right there,

122
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:44,840
one, died from pancreatic cancer.

123
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,440
All right.

124
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,040
And then we move out.

125
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,590
Now we have three patients left, okay?

126
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,590
We're going to have another patient who's
censored at this point.

127
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,900
One patient censored.

128
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,590
That patient entered the study six months
ago.

129
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,839
Enrolled six months ago.

130
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,850
Enrolled six months ago.

131
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,710
Okay?

132
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,480
Only followed for

133
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,000
six months, and then we go out to eight
months and something else happened.

134
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,420
Okay, so, at the end here, at the end of
six months we have two patients left,

135
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,710
because we started out with three.

136
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,430
We, we have one who is censored.

137
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,430
We ended up with two, two patients left.

138
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,760
And then, one patient dies.

139
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,050
And then the number of patient at risk is
two, one died.

140
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,700
So, that's an overall survival for that
interval, a sur-,

141
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,369
survival of that interval, of 50%.

142
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:52,490
So, we go from 60% down to 30%, okay?

143
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,800
And that patient,

144
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:02,635
that patient died in a car accident.

145
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:10,140
[SOUND]

146
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,130
And, you'll say, wait a minute, that's not
very fair.

147
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:19,970
It looks like, it looks like is impacting
survival after surgery.

148
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,400
But remember, we're only,

149
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,180
we've specified that we're going to look
at overall survival.

150
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:32,220
So, we have to, we have to just measure
whether patients are alive or dead.

151
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,820
And, and that's overall survival.

152
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,580
All we know, and, and all we know, it's
like it looks like a big effect,

153
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,540
because at that point there are only two
patients at risk, and

154
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,530
one died, happened to died in a car
accident, which is a very unlikely event.

155
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,780
But there are many possible unlikely
events.

156
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,400
And if we had a bigger study this wouldn't
have much of an impact, but

157
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,620
we have a small study.

158
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,930
So, at the end of that interval we have
one patient left.

159
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,840
There's no censoring that goes on.

160
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,900
There's one patient at the end.

161
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,860
No deaths at the end and so the last
patient's there.

162
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,390
And we're done.

163
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,160
So, the overall survival that we have from
this

164
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,019
study is shown as a Kaplan-Meier curve.

165
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,260
Kay.
Thank you very much.
