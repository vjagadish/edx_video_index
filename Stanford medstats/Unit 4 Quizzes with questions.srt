1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,794
This question wants us to find the
probability that we would get a score of

2
00:00:08,794 --> 00:00:11,860
three or less if we would roll a die.

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,960
now, this is a die which is fair, so each
and every outcome is equally probable.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,860
For us to roll a three or less we would
have to roll a 1, a 2 or a 3.

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,931
And we know that the probability of
getting any number on a die is 1/6 for

6
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:27,800
a fair die.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,474
So to get a score of 3 or less we would
just add up the probabilities and

8
00:00:32,474 --> 00:00:37,550
get the total probability to be 3/6, or
1/2.

9
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,100
So C is the right answer.

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,930
The answer to this question is true.

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,041
This is a discrete probability
distribution because there are only four

12
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,810
values that X can take.

13
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,763
The probability that a patient has at
least two major adverse events is

14
00:00:51,763 --> 00:00:56,319
the probability that the patient has two
adverse events or three adverse events,

15
00:00:56,319 --> 00:01:03,620
and if we add both of these probabilities
up, we get a total probability of 0.07.

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,400
This is the right answer.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,416
To find the expected value of x,

18
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:15,897
we would need to find the value of the
summation of x times px.

19
00:01:15,897 --> 00:01:18,750
So for x of 0 we have a 0 here.

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,805
For x is 1, we get.

21
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:25,110
0.13 for this, we get 0.1, and for 3 we
get 0.06.

22
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,204
And if we add all of these up,

23
00:01:29,204 --> 00:01:38,180
we get the expected value of x to be 0.29.

24
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,995
The answer for this question is D, for
minus $10.

25
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:46,720
The expected rally for this lottery is
minus 10.

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,400
Which is the amount you paid to play the
lottery.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,232
And, the amount you'd

28
00:01:54,232 --> 00:02:00,420
get if you win.

29
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,175
Times the probability of you winning.

30
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:04,580
Plus the amount that you'd get.

31
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:13,952
If you lose making zero dollars and the
probabiliyt of you winning, of you losing.

32
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:22,289
And if we add all of this up we get the
expected value to be negative $9.

33
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:33,160
We already calculated the mean for x as
point 29 in the previous section.

34
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,668
The formula for standard deviation in this
case is, and

35
00:02:37,668 --> 00:02:42,764
I will just write out a couple of terms to
illustrate what time,

36
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:49,294
what this expression will turn out to be.

37
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:56,154
For x of 0 we have, for x is 1 we have,

38
00:02:56,154 --> 00:03:02,769
and we'll have two more terms for

39
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:10,610
x is 2 and 3.

40
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:16,424
If we calculate our default expression,

41
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:19,844
we find that the value of

42
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:28,400
standard deviation is .65, which is D.

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,920
This question asks us to find the
probability of getting exactly 1

44
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,060
head in 5 coin flips.

45
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,860
This is a straight forward application of
the binomial equation.

46
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:46,040
Here we have N is 5, we have X is 1 and we
know that B is .5.

47
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,778
Putting that in into the binomial equation
we

48
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:57,910
get .5 times 1, and 2.5 times 4.

49
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,570
And if you multiply this out, we'll find
that the probability is 15.625 percent.

50
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:10,989
This question is again an application of
the binomial equation.

51
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,956
We have n is 10.

52
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:18,282
We have 9 coin, 9 heads, so our x value is
9 again, and

53
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:25,310
the probability of getting a head, or a
tail, is 0.5.

54
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:31,324
Putting that into this equation here, we
get the following expression for

55
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:36,950
the probability, [SOUND] which is the same
expression as we have in d,

56
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,978
which is the right answer.

57
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:46,364
This question gives us a case where we
have 150 participants,

58
00:04:46,364 --> 00:04:51,094
each of whom has a 50% chance of being
allocated to the treatment or

59
00:04:51,094 --> 00:05:01,017
to the control bucket and we want to find
the probability distribution of x.

60
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:07,410
Now it's very easy to see that the answer
to this is 'd'.

61
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,089
This is the binomial distribution with 'n'
equals 50 and

62
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:14,769
'p' equals .5 We could approximate it as a
normal distribution.

63
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:17,689
With n equals 150 as well but the exact
answer for

64
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:21,200
this question would be the binomial.

65
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,940
This question is similar to the question
we had previously.

66
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,987
The only difference is that now we have a
p value of 0.66 as oppose to a p

67
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:33,250
value of 0.5.

68
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,150
This is also a binomial distribution, and
the answer is e.

69
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:45,660
We'll be using 2 equations that we derived
for the binomial distribution here.

70
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,923
The first equation is the formula for

71
00:05:47,923 --> 00:05:52,390
the expected value of a binomial, which is
n times p.

72
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,831
We know that n here is 150, and p is one
half, so

73
00:05:55,831 --> 00:06:00,590
the expected value comes out to be 75.

74
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,998
We also know that the expression for the
standard deviation is

75
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:13,060
n times p P times 1 minus P and the square
root of that.

76
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:19,470
And if we substitute the value back in, we
see that the standard deviation is 6.

77
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,480
So let me just draw this out.

78
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,437
If we approximate this binomial as a
normal,

79
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:30,483
this is the mean.

80
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:39,590
Here we have a 75, and we know that 1
strand of deviation is 6 of it.

81
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,950
So if we have numbers between 69 and 81,

82
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:51,750
we would say that they are within one
standard deviation of the, the mean.

83
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,718
As the number that we are expected to find
is 69 we know that this is exactly one

84
00:06:55,718 --> 00:07:01,750
standard deviation away from the mean and
hence, we 'b' being the right answer.

85
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,728
This question again needs us to apply the
formulae that we

86
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:10,876
talked about earlier to find the expected
value of a binomial distribution and

87
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:16,012
the variance of a binomial distribution.

88
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:21,172
The expected value is N times P which
comes out to 25,

89
00:07:21,172 --> 00:07:27,532
the variance is N times P times 1 minus P
which comes out to 23.75,

90
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:35,572
the standard deviation is the square root
of the variance And the value we get for

91
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:44,570
the standard deviation is 4.87.

92
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,710
This question is a Speak Forward
application of the formula for z.

93
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,800
As z's quote is given by x minus mu by the
standard deviation.

94
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,385
In this case our x value is 0.95, our mu
is 1 and the standard deviation is 0.1.

95
00:07:55,385 --> 00:08:00,030
Locking the values in, begin the z score
to be minus 0.5.

96
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,298
The answer to this is fairly
straightforward, the,

97
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:07,402
the only statement, out of the 4 given
options, which is not 2, for

98
00:08:07,402 --> 00:08:15,770
anomalous distribution, is the fact that
it is a discrete probability distribution.

99
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,710
Anomalous distribution, if you remember,
is a continuous distribution.

100
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:24,384
This formula needs us to find out the z
squared for

101
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:31,266
the value of X, would be 0, then the mean
is 0.

102
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:33,622
Plugging this in, we know that the formula
for

103
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:36,855
Z is X minus mean by standard deviation.

104
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:43,730
If both X and mean are 0, we get a Z score
of 0.

105
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,495
This formula requires us to remember this
fact about the normal distribution.

106
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:50,015
Between one standard deviation below the
mean and

107
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:53,760
one standard deviation above the mean.

108
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,386
The fraction of the normal distribution
area that is enclosed is 68%,

109
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:07,820
which means that the area that is enclosed
Under two extreme edges is 32%.

110
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,950
Which means each of the two tails has an
area of 16%.

111
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:19,260
Now, let's use that to solve this
equation.

112
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,042
Do you know that the z

113
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:23,440
value of one corresponds to one standard
deviation above the mean?

114
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,520
We want to find the area to the left to z
of 1.

115
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,890
We could just find the area to the right
of z of 1 and then subtract 1 from that.

116
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,256
And as we found out previously,

117
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:40,740
this area is 16% which tells us that this
area is 84%.

118
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,105
This question.

119
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:49,515
Answers to identify the type of
probability distribution demonstrated by

120
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:51,630
the x vaiable here.

121
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,780
And it's very clearly obvious that this
variable doesn't follow the normal

122
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,340
binomaial or the uniform distribution.

123
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,549
This is an imperical distribution that was
observed in an experiment and

124
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:07,876
it doesn't follow any of the standard
Distribution that we have studied so far.

125
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:15,730
We are given that we have a binomial
distribution with N of 100 and B of 0.2.

126
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,868
Using the formula the expected value of X.

127
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:22,640
Which is np.

128
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,470
You get the expected value to be 20.

129
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:32,660
The formula for standard deviation of x is
n times p times 1 minus p.

130
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:39,900
Plugging values in, we see that the
standard deviation is 4.

131
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,560
This question asks us to

132
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,945
approximate the binomial distribtion from
the previous question.

133
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:44,460
Question as in normal distribution.

134
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,568
We know that the expected value for this
distrubution is 20 and

135
00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:52,220
that the standard deviation is 4.

136
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,912
These are the [INAUDIBLE] in the previous
question The probability of getting 20

137
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:59,080
successes or fewer.

138
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,410
If I just draw it out for a normal
distribution.

139
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,150
It's just all the probability to the left
of the mean, and because we know

140
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:13,523
that a normal distribution is symmetric,
we know that this probability is 50%.

141
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,120
The correct answer here is C, that the
mean and median are far apart.

142
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,450
In a normal distribution, we have the mean
to be same as the median.

143
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,200
This is because in a normal distribution,

144
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,250
we have equal number of points to the left
as to the right of the median.

145
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,775
And hence, the mean is the same as the
median.

146
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:38,180
If we have a distribution in which the
mean and the median are far.

147
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,690
Far apart, that is clearly not a normal
distribution.

148
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,190
