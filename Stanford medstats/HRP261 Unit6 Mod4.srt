1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,880
In this next module, I'm going to talk
about variable selection in a case

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,040
where you're trying to identify multiple
important causal predictors of an outcome.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,260
And there's a really nice discussion of
this in Biddinghoff textbook,

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,640
it's very short, so I'd recommend reading
it there as well.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,740
So the ideal situation when we're doing a
medical study is we would like to

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,380
have a primary hypothesis of interest from
the get-go.

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,410
You, you design a study around that, and
you get your data, you analyze your data.

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,920
By doing so, and pre-specifying everything
ahead of time,

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,360
having one main hypothesis, you control
your type one error.

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,680
Of course the reality is, we often do
that, but in the course of doing

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,790
a particular study, we collect a whole
bunch of data that's interesting data and

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,990
worth mining for additional information.

13
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,830
But that changes the situation for model
building now because now there's not

14
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,320
necessarily a single predictor of
interest.

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,880
We might be mining our data set just to
say,

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,190
well what are other predictors of the
outcome.

17
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,310
So we might be interested in multiple
important predictors that might have

18
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,540
a causal relationship with our outcome.

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,030
And that's perfectly fine to do.

20
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,730
It's worth doing what we call secondary
analysis like these.

21
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,080
Because we're getting the data are there
and

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,390
we want to mine that for useful
information.

23
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:29,690
However, variable selection in this
scenario becomes much much trickier.

24
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,180
It's a bit of an art.

25
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,030
There are multiple potential approaches
that you can take and

26
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,150
different people will have slightly
different preferences for how to do this.

27
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:42,810
A lot of it will be guided by some kind of
clinical judgement as well.

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,890
So, variable selection is,

29
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,480
as you're going to see in a minute, is
going to be more decision points.

30
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,350
And, when you're doing these types of
analyses where you're screening for

31
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,972
a number of po, potential important
predictors,

32
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:57,360
you're obviously increasing your risk of a
type one error.

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,990
Now, it's generally not recommended that
you somehow try to do some kind of

34
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,240
p value correction in this context.

35
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,220
And that's simply because there's so

36
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,980
many decision points in the model building
process here that it's actually really

37
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:15,060
hard to say what the true p value is or
the true p value level is.

38
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,290
So hard to attach a, p value adjustment
here.

39
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,580
Rather than doing that we tent to just
want to interpret the results cautiously.

40
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,820
You have to tell your reader that this
came from a data set that was set up

41
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,960
to test something else and that you're
mining it for additional information and

42
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,430
therefore that things have to be taken
with a grain of salt.

43
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,800
That there is going to be some chance
findings expected to arise.

44
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,510
So I thought the easiest way to illustrate
this would be just to

45
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,410
go through an actual example.

46
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,060
So this was a data set, that I was
involved in.

47
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,910
A paper I was involved in a number of
years ago.

48
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,640
You can see that I do a lot of data
analysis on stress factors in runners.

49
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,387
because, I used to be a competitive
runner, and

50
00:02:57,387 --> 00:03:02,010
this is a different data set actually than
I talked about with stress fractures and

51
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,510
runners last week, this was a data set
that came from a randomized trial.

52
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,430
So we have randomized women runners.

53
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,250
To take hormonal contraception or not.

54
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,620
To see if that had an effect on bone
density and stress fractures.

55
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,900
But then after we answered that question,
and wrote up the main paper, here we had

56
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,980
sitting this great data set with all of
these variables that we had collected and

57
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,970
we wanted to say, well, can we identify
other risk factors for stress fractures?

58
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,430
So, this is the secondary analysis from a
randomized trial.

59
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,170
You can see it's a different data set
because my N now is 125.

60
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,840
These were college age women, so

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,990
older than the data set that I talked
about last week.

62
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,350
We had a number of predictors that had
previously been linked to

63
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,140
stress fractures, or

64
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,670
that we had some reason to believe would
be linked to stress fractures.

65
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,250
So we had measure bone density on the
women, menstrual function, calcium intake,

66
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,660
injury history, training Body size and
composition age,

67
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,820
all things that we suspected, could be
factors in stress fracture development.

68
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,080
So how do we actually do this model
building this variable selection?

69
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,560
So what's typically done in this kind of
scenario.

70
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,790
Is that we want to screen through a number
of potential predictors, and

71
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,350
a way to do that is to do univariate
analyses, so

72
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:20,780
to run each predictor with the outcome in
a separate logistic regression model.

73
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,256
Or in this case, we actually have
prospective data, so

74
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:27,940
Cox regression was run, but it's actually
pretty much the same procedure.

75
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,550
So if we had a logistic model for

76
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,040
stress fracture we would do one variable
at a time.

77
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,840
So here's a predictor that I think might
be related, I put that in a model,

78
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,190
I run a unit variant model.

79
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,000
That gives me a sense, just sort of a
screening of which ones are related to

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,770
stress fractures, in the unit area way.

81
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,660
Now there was a little bit of extra detail
here.

82
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,000
Since these data came from a randomized
trial,

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,940
we decided that it was important in all
models to take that into account.

84
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,760
So even in the quote unquote unit area
models, or only looking at one potential

85
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:03,250
predictor at a time, we also had adjusted
for the site in the clinical trial,

86
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,360
which Would be dummy coded as well as what
randomization group the women had been in

87
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,370
just in case there were any effects of
those two things throughout the trial.

88
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,550
So there's a few other things lurking in
the model,

89
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,640
but it pretty much we're just looking at
one predictor at a time.

90
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,578
Those actually didn't have much of an
effect on the estimates.

91
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:24,610
So here is a variable screen, here's all
the results of the predictors

92
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:30,060
test one at a time with just these other
two randomized trial details in the model.

93
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,000
So you can see that lots of things, lots
of predictors were tested.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,670
There's a whole bunch of things in this
table, okay.

95
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,930
So we had a whole bunch of variables we
wanted in we thought that,

96
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,910
we thought might be relevant.

97
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:41,870
We wanted to test them out.

98
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,780
One thing that you'll notice is that a lot
of

99
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,750
the variables are highly related to one
another.

100
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,020
So height, weight, body mass index,
percent body fat lean mass.

101
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,500
All these things are measures of body size
and composition.

102
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,490
We've got a bunch of measures about how
long you've been running,

103
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,659
how much you run.

104
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,270
We've got history of fractures number of
menstrual variable menstrual function

105
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:10,560
variable a whole bunch about bone density
cause had given that mendesa.

106
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,830
We had a lot of bone density and

107
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,270
bone mineral content which is slightly
different than density, we had that.

108
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,830
We had two measurements related to calcium
intake.

109
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,770
So a lot of these are overlapping.

110
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,090
That means one of the first decision
points that's going to need to

111
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,350
be made here is which if this when they're
highly overlapping and

112
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,940
they both seem to be related to fractures.

113
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,530
Or multiple ones seem to be related to
fractures.

114
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:37,040
Which of these do we carry over and test
in the final model.

115
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,980
Now I'll just remind you that last week I
talked about

116
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,860
principal components analysys.

117
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,450
And one of the advantages of doing a
principal components analysis was that you

118
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,610
might be able to take some of these highly
correlated variables, and

119
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,800
rather than having to just drop some and
ignore some, you could compress them

120
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,200
into a single variable and take that
forward for regression.

121
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,390
So that is another option that wasn't done
here.

122
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,240
Again, just to show you some language from
how these things are written up in papers.

123
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,320
So in the statistical analysis section in
the,

124
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,620
when the, we're describing how the
multi-variable models work.

125
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,060
How the variables were chosen for the
final multi-variable models.

126
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,260
The first thing that's talked about is
just the fact that

127
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,990
we didn't take forward all of the
variables in table one here.

128
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,358
For the multivariate regression model, we
were choosy about it.

129
00:07:25,358 --> 00:07:29,160
So, various, the various indicators of
bone mass basically,

130
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,350
were all highly correlated.

131
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,930
So, we had bone mass and bone density in
their hip,

132
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,900
we had whole body...it's fine, all these
are highly correlated.

133
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,560
Bone density is highly correlated with
content.

134
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,810
So we selected one of them.

135
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,110
We selected whole body bone mineral
content for

136
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,190
our primary multivariate model.

137
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:45,990
And why did we do that?

138
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,990
There's some justification.

139
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,450
Notice, this is all just clinical
judgment.

140
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,180
It, there was, first of all, it was
strongly associated with stress fractures.

141
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,910
So we are looking at saying, hey, that
one, it does look like

142
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,120
it has a stronger relation the strongest
relationship with stress fracture.

143
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,440
There were multiple skeletal sites where
stress fractures could occur, so

144
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,470
a whole body bone strength measure might
be the most relevant.

145
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,920
And there's some technical things about
how to

146
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,880
measure bone strength especially when
you're growing, so

147
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,750
there was some reasons for choosing that
one out of the set.

148
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,660
Also, similarly, daily calcium intake and

149
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,620
servings of dairy products were highly
correlated.

150
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,390
We chose dietary calcium intake for the
multivariate model.

151
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,450
Now, if you go back and look at table one,
I'll just highlight here,

152
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,210
if you look at calcium intake and servings
of dairy products.

153
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,500
So calcium intake didn't quite make
statistical significance.

154
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,860
However, servings of dairy products did.

155
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,970
And yet, a judgment was made not based on
the p-value there, but

156
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,250
that dietary calcium is really more
relevant, because that's kind of

157
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,890
what we're after, what we think would be
related to bone density.

158
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,010
So a decision was made to put dietary
calcium forward and

159
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,380
not dairy, without P value shopping.

160
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,090
And finally, lean body mass was so
strongly to bone mineral content that it

161
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,770
was felt that it couldn't be carried
forward, so

162
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,170
it was not carried forward into the
multivariate model.

163
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,560
So there's some choices being made just in
terms among highly correlated variables.

164
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,720
Which ones do we even try out in the
multivariate model And then it's saying

165
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,920
well accordingly here is what we brought
forward for the multivariate model.

166
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,150
age, height, weight, history of stress
fracture, age at menarche,

167
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,830
history of menstrual irregularity.

168
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,750
And, and the ones we just talked about
where,

169
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,800
was, there was some decision point that
had to be made.

170
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,840
And this is along with certain other
variables I don't remember exactly what

171
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,320
those were, I didn't actually do the
analysis here, but

172
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,150
I think out of the ones that you saw in
the earlier table.

173
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,360
Some of them clearly had some relationship
or had, there was some indication of

174
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,810
a relationship with stress fractures,
those were carried forward.

175
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,250
Some clearly were very close to one on the
odds ratio, didn't look at all related.

176
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,990
Those were not carried forward.

177
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,120
And then that's who, what we included in a
multivariate model.

178
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,090
And then we're going to prune some of
those and

179
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,610
only retain some of those from the models.

180
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,120
So what was the decision point there?

181
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,960
So the decision was made to,

182
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,720
that those that were significant at a P of
less than .10 were retained in the model.

183
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,530
Those that had P is greater than .1 were
removed or pruned from the model.

184
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,000
However, there was one variable that's
really relevant to

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,720
stress fractures in women, which is a
history of menstrual irregularity.

186
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,820
And, even though P was les, greater than
.1.

187
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,730
A decision was made to keep that in the
multivariate model because the effect

188
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,170
size was actually large and it was
consistent with other studies.

189
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,400
So even though it didn't make statistical
significance in our small study,

190
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,020
we still it was important to keep it on
the model.

191
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,460
So notice how many decision points have
been made here in terms of

192
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,420
the choice of this multivariate model.

193
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,270
And somebody else looking at these data
could have come up with slightly different

194
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,300
choices and definitely could have come up
with a slightly different final model.

195
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,140
But the general procedure of looking at
the univariate analyses and then moving

196
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,160
some of them forward to the multivarieate
anaylysis and then pruning some that

197
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,360
are no longer significant is kind of the
way, the general process that's used.

198
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,830
Here's the resulting multivariate model.

199
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:10,070
So the things that stuck in the model
again are the P less than .10, were age,

200
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,810
and, and no, this is an interesting point
about presentation of data, but

201
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,080
all of hte relative risks are set up so
they are greater than one.

202
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,860
There was somebody, there was a coauthor
on our page who insisted that

203
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,630
doctors wouldn't understand rate ratios or
risk ratios below one.

204
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,670
They wouldn't understand what that means,
so that we had to make them all above one

205
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,790
by making things like age per year younger
increases your risk.

206
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,020
So the younger you are, the more your risk
is.

207
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,750
I actually don't like that at all, because
I think it's much more natural to

208
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,680
say per year older of age, your risk is
per, your,

209
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,810
your risk is lowered But anyway, this is
what ended up in the paper.

210
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,290
So being younger was protective.

211
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,670
Having a history of stress fractures was
really highly related.

212
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,920
So if you're prone to stress fractures, if
you've already had one,

213
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,880
you're probably much, much, much more
likely to have one in the future.

214
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,780
And these are actually risk ratios, rate
ratios.

215
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,380
So this can be interpreted as a six fold
increase in risk.

216
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,310
The bone density also highly related.

217
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,220
This is per standard deviation lower.

218
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,170
So the lower you are, one state of
deviation lower in bone mineral content.

219
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,680
Where this is associated with a doubling
or tripling of risk.

220
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,260
Dietary calcium didn't quite make
statistical significance.

221
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,120
P is less than 0.10 here.

222
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,610
But having, less calcium in your diet
means more risk.

223
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,940
Age at menarche was significantly related
at p of 0.05.

224
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,500
And then finally this history of menstrual
irregularity.

225
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,800
Notice that, totally not significant but
the effect size is pretty big.

226
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,840
And because it has been pretty well
established in other studies that this is

227
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,010
an association.

228
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,170
We kept this in the model.

229
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,430
Again, many decision points here.

230
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:54,030
Now I just want to contrast this with, I
actually did an example last week,

231
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:58,500
essentially, of a multiple important
predictors of variable selection.

232
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,080
When I was talking about principal
components anaylsis.

233
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,530
So I'll just kind of put upon for

234
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,740
principle components analysis here by
showing that the variable selection for

235
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,600
the multivariate model was a heck of a lot
easier in that case.

236
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,820
So just a reminder, I had a different data
set on 91 high school women runners

237
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,670
who had, we had many of the same variables
measured and

238
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,410
one of the outcomes of interest was stress
factor.

239
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,800
Now this was a logistic regression rather
than a Cox regression.

240
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,770
But I, I actually took all of those
multiple measures of

241
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,680
things like body size and composition, and
running performance and

242
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,820
special function and I ran that principal
components analysis

243
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,030
to come up with four components at the end
of the day.

244
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,435
The nice thing about doing it that way is,
the variable selection for

245
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:46,760
the final logistic regression model was
totally easy.

246
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,520
There was nothing to do really.

247
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,990
Once I have got principle components,
they're uncorrelated with one another.

248
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,990
That means that whether I analyze them by
themselves or whether I analyze them

249
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,890
with other of, other principle components
in the model, I get the same answer.

250
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,390
So, in other words, if I ran this same
regression model with body fat,

251
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,000
in the model and nothing else, I'm
going to get the same beta and

252
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,510
the same p value, essentially, with very
slight change.

253
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,410
If I run body fatness with running
performance in the model and drop body

254
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,000
size and menstrual function, I'm going to
get the same betas and the same P values.

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,130
In other words there's really no decision
to be made about which variables

256
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:21,730
go in the model.

257
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,860
Once I've done principal component
analysis I've already compressed my data I

258
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,650
now have uncorrelated predictors so

259
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,130
I can just put them all in the model and,
and I'm done.

260
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,440
And so it does simplify your life for
variable selection.

261
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,790
I just want to again caution on p value
shopping in this

262
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,680
scenario again many opportunities to go p
value shopping.

263
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,770
You know the more predictors you test of
course we want to test ones that would be

264
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:50,540
more relevant, But the more you test the
more chances of a type one error.

265
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,910
And you can imagine you know trying lot's
a different combination of models and

266
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,410
trying to optimize the one with the
highest numbers,

267
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,990
Highest number of significant p-values.

268
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,790
Shopping around, just, what is the model
that gives me the best p-values?

269
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,340
That, we don't want to do.

270
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,180
You can see that that wasn't done in the
example I showed you.

271
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:11,240
And, an automated way to try as many
models as possible until you find the one

272
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,390
with the highest number of significant
p-values is to use those automatic

273
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,550
selection procedures, which we've talked
about before backwards forwards,

274
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,150
step wise, automated regression with the
computer.

275
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:27,120
And it's probably better to avoid those
for this particular situation.

276
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,530
And there's again, lots of opportunities
for p value shopping,

277
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,679
you want to be very careful that you're
not doing p value shopping.
