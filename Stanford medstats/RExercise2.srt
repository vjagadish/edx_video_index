1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,280
Welcome to the second R module.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,500
In this video, I'll be walking through the
solutions to the second R exercise.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,680
You'll also be able to find a written
version of these solutions on

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,570
the class website.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:22,590
The first thing I'm going to do is to
start Deducer.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,479
In this exercise, we'll be using the same
data set as in the previous exercise.

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,952
The data set's called mock class data, and
it's provided to you in Excel form.

8
00:00:31,952 --> 00:00:34,774
We see two familiar windows on the screen.

9
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:37,596
On the left we have the console window and

10
00:00:37,596 --> 00:00:40,501
on the right we have the data viewer
window.

11
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:43,260
Window.
In order to open the class data,

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,863
I'm going to click on the Open Data icon
on the Data Viewer window, and then I'm

13
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:56,410
going to navigate to where I have the mock
class data set saved onto my computer.

14
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,660
For me, that's on the desktop.

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,889
So I'm going to select that and hit Open.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,740
then Deducer prompts me, asks me which
worksheet should be loaded.

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:13,580
Since our data only has one worksheet, I'm
going to just click Okay.

18
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:19,180
And then we see that Deducer was able to
load all of our data, I'm going to scroll

19
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,665
all the way to the right just to make sure
everything was loaded, and scroll down.

20
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:26,080
I have 50 rows.

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,980
Excellent.

22
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,930
So now we're ready to start the exercise.

23
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:34,100
The first problem is asking us

24
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,080
whether those people who are varsity
athletes in high school.

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,080
Currently exercise more than those people
who

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,330
were not varsity athletes in high school.

27
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,250
And so, question 1A is asking us what
statistical test we would use to

28
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,690
make this comparison and why.

29
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:58,040
And so, the thought process is that we are
comparing two unrelated groups,

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,330
varsity athletes and non-varsity athletes
on a continuous measure.

31
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,770
So that's the amount of exercise they
have.

32
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,800
And so these 2 things taken together leads
to the conclusion that we

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,532
want to use the 2 sample t-test, otherwise
known as the independent samples.

34
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:15,980
T test.

35
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,810
Again the reason why we're using this test
instead of the Paired T

36
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,890
test is that these two groups are not
correlated.

37
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:27,670
Then the questions asks us to perform the
statistical test,

38
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,310
report the P value for that test, and

39
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:36,980
to also plot, the relationship between
each group.

40
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,760
That's 1-C.

41
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,040
We're just going to do both at the same
time here.

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,574
So, the first step is to look at the
consult window and

43
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:49,260
select Analysis, and two sample tests.

44
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,210
This brings up the two independent sample
tests menu.

45
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,410
The first thing that we're going to do is
to split up

46
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,400
our cohort into varsity athletes and
non-varsity athletes in high school.

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,435
So, we're going to select varsity and drag
that over to factor.

48
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:09,046
And then we're going to click on split.

49
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:14,390
I am going to select 0 into group 1 and 1
into group 2.

50
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:20,171
Now in this situation it doesn't really
matter on

51
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:25,605
where the 0 and 1 go, so I could have 0 in
group 2 and 1 in group 1.

52
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,975
Boyd realized that this is a neat way
[UNKNOWN]

53
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,130
said you had more that two Two levels.

54
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,410
This a neat way of selecting which two
comparisons you wanted to make.

55
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,402
So we're going to hit okay.

56
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:43,270
In the outcomes box, I'm going to drag
over the exercise variable.

57
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,830
Because that's what we're trying to
compare.

58
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,595
In the lower left corner of the menu we
see

59
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,760
See that the t-test is selected by
default.

60
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,440
So that's good.

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,330
I'm going to click on the wrench here just
because I want to,

62
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,020
or the gear here, because I want to see
what options we have.

63
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:04,020
It seems like we have the option to run
the t-test assuming unequal variances or

64
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,950
equal variances.

65
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,247
For now I'm going to leave this as unequal
variances.

66
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,870
I hit Okay.

67
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,280
Then you also notice that there's a plots
button here, so I'm going to click that

68
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,890
and click on horizontal, so that it
generates a plot for us.

69
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,910
And I'm going to hit Okay, and then Run.

70
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,680
So notice, a few things happened.

71
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,868
One is that we have a window that shows
two box plots, and

72
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:36,430
we'll address that in a moment.

73
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,550
What we also see on the left-hand side
that there's an output in

74
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,279
the console window.

75
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,580
So spreading that out, we see a few
things.

76
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,755
So we see that the mean of the mean level

77
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:57,060
of exercise for those people.

78
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,550
That have a 0 coded under varsity.

79
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,815
So in English that means the mean hours of
exercise for

80
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:06,942
non-varsity athletes was found to be
3.575.

81
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:09,670
So approximately 3.6.

82
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,640
And that the mean or the mean for varsity
athletes or

83
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:20,370
the mean of level 1 for varsity was 4.55.

84
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,510
And so we know that, we see that there's a
difference here in the means.

85
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,938
There's a difference Of about, you know
one hour of exercise on average.

86
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:35,690
But then we look at the p value which is
in the row below that.

87
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,957
And we notice that that p value is .21.

88
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:44,402
So our conclusion is that there's no
statistically significant

89
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:48,480
difference Between the means of these two
groups.

90
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,745
So, said another way, our conclusion is

91
00:05:51,745 --> 00:05:58,050
that there's no statistically significant
difference in the amount of exercise.

92
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,170
That people who are varsity athletes in
high school.

93
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:07,100
Get right now versus non varsity athletes.

94
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,940
To reinforce that conclusion what we're
going to do is look at our plot here.

95
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,790
It's always a good idea to visualize your
data just to make sure.

96
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,940
You understand what's going on.

97
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,540
It can sort of act as a very good sanity
check.

98
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,540
On the x-axis here we have exercise.

99
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,550
And on the y-axis we have our two groups,
varsity and non-varsity athletes.

100
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,280
And we can tell that although the averages
are different.

101
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,380
There's a significant amount of overlap in
how the data is distributed.

102
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,970
And so it's not surprising that we came to

103
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,490
the result that we can not reject the
null.

104
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,520
Moving on to problem two, now we're
interested in comparing whether

105
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,640
students love math more, or whether
students love writing more.

106
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,680
And the way we're going to do that in this
data set is to compare the math

107
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,217
love variable and the writing love.

108
00:07:01,217 --> 00:07:03,890
Of variable, pretty convenient.

109
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,720
And so the first part of this question
asks us what

110
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,040
statistical test we would use to make this
comparison and why.

111
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,950
Well, in this case, what we're going to do
is we're going to use a paried t tes.

112
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,690
And the reason we're using a paried t test
this time is

113
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,950
because these two variables actually are
correlated.

114
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,270
They are related.

115
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,980
And they're related because the same
student answered both questions.

116
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:38,684
So student A you can imagine would fill
out writing love and math love.

117
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:42,690
And if student A really liked school he's
going to, he or

118
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:50,445
she is going to score those two variables
very highly and so they're related.

119
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:55,010
So the second part of this question asks
us how this statistical test differs from

120
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,130
the test in question 1.

121
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,700
So in question 1 we used the independent
samples T-test.

122
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,230
And in this question we're using the
paired samples T-test.

123
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,250
Now how are these two different?

124
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,940
In question 1 if you remember what we were
doing was we

125
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,850
were comparing the mean exercise values.

126
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,460
Or the mean exercise levels for two
separate groups,

127
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,380
varsity athletes and non-varsity athletes.

128
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,500
So you can imagine what Deducer or

129
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,050
what R is doing in the background is that
it's calculating the means separately for

130
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,190
both groups and it calculates a standard
error for that mean.

131
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,235
Or a standard deviation.

132
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:35,210
And based on that variation it's able to
compare these 2

133
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,260
means to say whether there's an actual
difference.

134
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,670
In a paired t test because we want to
maintain the correlation,

135
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,660
we want to maintain the relationship
between the two variables,

136
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,800
writing love and math love, what our
deducer's actually doing is that it's

137
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,960
taking the difference between math love
and writing love and

138
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,075
seeing if that, if the mean of that
difference is different than zero.

139
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:03,790
Let me say that a different way.

140
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,450
So in the first question, with the two
samples What we're

141
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,810
doing is we're comparing the two means
between each other.

142
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,550
And in this question we're calculating a
difference between, between

143
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,340
the two variables and then we're comparing
that mean difference with zero to

144
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,430
see if it's statistically significant.

145
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:29,842
To see if there's a statistically
significant

146
00:09:29,842 --> 00:09:32,570
difference.

147
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,530
Between that mean difference and zero.

148
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:39,070
So, third part of question two asks us to

149
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:44,450
perform this statistical test and to
report the PRE for it and

150
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:50,310
to state on average how different are
these quote-unquote love scores.

151
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,300
So let's do that.

152
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,140
I'm going to click Analysis.

153
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,455
And then go to the Paired Test option
here.

154
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:04,810
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to
select both Math Love and Writing Love.

155
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,105
And drag those into the boxes labeled
first and second.

156
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:14,980
It doesn't matter in to which category you
drag each variable.

157
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,420
Just keep in mind that the mean difference
is going to be flipped.

158
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,500
The sign of the mean difference is going
to be flipped,

159
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,350
in the output if you flip these two.

160
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,870
So, T-test is selected by default, so
that's good.

161
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,410
And then I'm just going to hit run, and

162
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,350
we have our output in the console window
here.

163
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:40,010
We notice that our p value is 0.098, which
means that we cannot reject

164
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:49,010
the null hypothesis based on an alpha
level of 0.05.

165
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,520
We would need the p value to be less than
Than 0.05.

166
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,830
So, our conclusion is that there's no
statistically significant difference

167
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:03,410
between how much people in this cohort
like writing versus math.

168
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,410
Notice that we come to this conclusion
even though

169
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,500
the mean difference between the two groups
is about seven and a half points.

170
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:20,250
Which is illustrated a few lines below the
p-value output.

171
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:26,320
Question three asks us for an assumption
of the previous two tests.

172
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,340
And that we check this condition for the
variable riding love visually.

173
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,810
And so what the question is implying is
that the variables for

174
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,080
a T-test need to be normally distributed.

175
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,512
That's one of the assumptions of the
T-test, it's a parametric test.

176
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:49,400
As a side note actually the paired T-test
does not

177
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,750
assume normality for the variables, but it
assumes normality for the difference.

178
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,720
Between the 2 variables.

179
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,940
So just keep that in mind.

180
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,370
So we want to check normality for the
writing love variable.

181
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,640
And to do that what we're going to do is
plot that variable.

182
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,924
So I'm going to select Plots, Plot
Builder.

183
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:14,230
I'm going to drag down Histogram here and

184
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:20,410
select riding love, and just visually look
at our output.

185
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,080
And so we notice that it doesn't look very
normally distributed.

186
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,890
It actually looks pretty bimodal with a
peak centering around 20% riding love,

187
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,840
and another peak around 70%.

188
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,478
So I would say that this doesn't look Very
normal.

189
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:41,645
Question 4 leads us to then

190
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:46,820
investigate this relationship further by
using a non parametric test.

191
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,860
So, question 4 asks us to

192
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,970
run the non parametric version of the test
in question 1.

193
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,079
So, what statistical test will we use to.

194
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,100
To make this comparison.

195
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,260
Well the non-parametric version of the
independent samples T-test is

196
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,360
called the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test.

197
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,120
And it's asking us to perform this
statistical test.

198
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,120
So I'm going to hit cancel here, and the
way to do this would be to

199
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,760
go to Analysis and then go back to Two
Sample Test.

200
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,125
You'll see that our variables are still
where we left them,

201
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:30,470
exercises under the outcomes box, and
varsity is in the factor box.

202
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,145
What we need to do here is to uncheck T
test and

203
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:40,924
check Wilcoxon here because we want the
Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test.

204
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:44,706
Then I'm going to hit Run.

205
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:49,390
You'll notice it generated a plot for me
again because I didn't have it unchecked.

206
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:53,570
The plot should look identical to our
previous plot.

207
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,681
We look at the p-value in the console
window under the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

208
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:06,730
Heading, and we see that the p-value is
equal to 0.19.

209
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,750
So this does not change our conclusion.

210
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,990
If you remember previously, we had a
p-value of 0.21.

211
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,440
So it lowers it a little bit actually but,

212
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,470
it's still greater than 0.05, so we can
not reject the null.

213
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:24,420
Question 5 is asking us

214
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,981
What menu option we would select to
perform an ANOVA?

215
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:32,470
So, it's basically asking us how we would
perform an ANOVA and Deducer and R.

216
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:38,920
Well, if you think about it, an ANOVA is

217
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,580
kind of like an extension of a t-test over
multiple groups.

218
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,629
So it makes sense to have it near the
T-test option.

219
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:53,970
So if we're hunting for this, I would go
under Analysis and

220
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,920
try to look somewhere near the Two Sample
Test.

221
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,840
And I notice that it says the K-Sample
Test, well what is that?

222
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:07,290
So K-Sample Test actually just means
multiple independent samples,

223
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,270
so K just being a random number.

224
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:15,125
So a random number of samples And to back
this up we also see in the bottom

225
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:20,830
left-hand corner, the default test here is
a one-way ANOVA.

226
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:26,050
So to run an ANOVA in Deducer even though
we won't actually run one now,

227
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,800
you'd go to Analysis.

228
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,110
Select key sample test and then select
your variables in this menu.

229
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,220
Moving on to question six.

230
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,920
So we're now interested in seeing whether
there's a difference in whether one

231
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,300
considers themselves book smart or street
smart.

232
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,240
Based upon whether you played a varsity
sport in high school.

233
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,555
So, 6A asks us what statistical test we'd
use in this situation.

234
00:15:57,555 --> 00:16:00,454
What's different about this question.

235
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:08,460
Is that the variable for book smart or
street smart is categorical, okay?

236
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,100
It's not a continuous variable here
because there are only two options.

237
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,919
A categorical variable could have more
than two levels.

238
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:18,270
So it just so happens that there are only
two levels here.

239
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,670
It's yes book smart or no book smart.

240
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,620
Which means you consider yourself street
smart.

241
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,070
And so in this situation we wouldn't want
to use a T test.

242
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,340
We would want to use a chi-square test.

243
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,840
So let's do that.

244
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,580
So I'm going to close the plot here.

245
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:42,510
And in order to run a chi-square test I'm
going to go to analysis.

246
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,550
And click on Contingency Tables.

247
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:51,120
And again it doesn't matter which
variables I put into the row or column for

248
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,471
the chi squared test, so I'm going to drag
over Varsity, as a row.

249
00:16:55,471 --> 00:17:01,091
And I'm going to drag over IsBookSmart
into the column section.

250
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:06,164
And, there are a bunch of menus on the
right hand side, here.

251
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:08,279
Let's explore these for a second.

252
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,940
So cells allows us to ask for certain
percentages.

253
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,440
Or certain values related to the
Chi-Square test that we want.

254
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,700
For now I'm going to leave these
unchecked.

255
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,400
Under statistics we can ask for different
tests.

256
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,490
The Chi-Square test is selected by
default, but

257
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,880
we also do the likelihood ratio test,
Fisher's exact test.

258
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,040
And even do a Mantel-Haenszel test.

259
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,680
I'm going to leave all those unselected
for now as well.

260
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:42,050
Results let's us save the results.

261
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,810
I'm going to also leave that blank.

262
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,780
It's good to know what these menus do.

263
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:54,950
I'm going to hit run for now and see what
we have here.

264
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,960
So you see this two by two table.

265
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,490
You see that we have a Chi-squared
statistic and

266
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,690
a p-value associated with that.

267
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:10,390
But what should jump out at you is the low
number of cells in the.

268
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,340
First column here.

269
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:17,060
So because the cell numbers are low,

270
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,170
and because one of them is less than 5,

271
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:26,160
I suspect that maybe the chi square test
is not the best test to use here.

272
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,550
And that we should instead be using the
Fishers exact test.

273
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:36,140
Now I remember seeing that in the menus
before, so I'm going to go select that.

274
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,710
So I'm going to click on Analysis, and
then go to Contingency Tables.

275
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,850
The variables are still where we left
them, but

276
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,934
I'm going to click on statistics and Also
select Fisher's exact test.

277
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:55,294
Now the criteria for using Fisher's exact
test is really a rule of thumb.

278
00:18:55,294 --> 00:18:59,958
There's no hard and fast rule, or
statistical rule,

279
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:05,364
I guess I should say, where you need to
use Fisher's exact test.

280
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:11,380
But I guess it's more accurate to say that
Fisher's exact test does a better job of

281
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:17,170
calculating the p-value when the expected
cell values are less than five.

282
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,290
I'll say that again in a different way.

283
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:24,987
So, the Chi-Square test does not do a good
job of approximating

284
00:19:24,987 --> 00:19:30,540
the Key value of the relationship between
two variables when the expected cell

285
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:36,380
value in any of the cells of the
contingency table is less than five.

286
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,040
To illustrate that point, I'm going to
also select the expected cell

287
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,350
counts by clicking on Cells and checking
Expected.

288
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,225
going to hit Run.

289
00:19:47,225 --> 00:19:52,550
You'll notice it generates the same table,
as before,

290
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:57,530
but there's additional output this time
because we had Fisher's exact selected.

291
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,100
We see that the chi squared p value is
3.19, and

292
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,320
the Fisher's exact test p-value is .367
You'll

293
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,170
see that the Fisher's exact test
attenuates the relationship a little bit.

294
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:14,070
And that the Chi-Square test does not as
good of

295
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,015
a job when the cell counts are low.

296
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,450
Let me scroll up a little bit here.

297
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,310
There are extra rows for the expected cell
count, and

298
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:29,080
you'll notice that these are definitely
less, that 3.67 is definitely less than 5.

299
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,120
So it's correct here to use the Fisher's
exact test, or I guess I

300
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,420
should say it's more accurate to use the
Fisher's exact test in this situation.

301
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,200
Our conclusion, of course, is that there's
no relationship Between these two

302
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,375
variables, and that or said another way,
there's no

303
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,950
relationship between whether you played a
varsity sport in high school and

304
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:54,290
whether you consider yourself book smart
based on the data in this data set.

305
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:59,584
The last question asks us to calculate the
risk ratio and the odds ratio for For

306
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:01,720
this relationship.

307
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,270
This is just a bit of an, a review
exercise here.

308
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:09,570
If your remember the risk ratio is defined
as

309
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,587
A over A plus B, and C over C plus D.

310
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:20,550
Now the 2 by 2 here is arranged a little
bit differently,

311
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:26,730
if we wanted to calculate the risk ratio
for, the risk of...

312
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,930
This is a little funny saying it this way,

313
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,840
but it's the risk of considering yourself
book smart.

314
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,810
Given that you played a varsity sport in
high school What you

315
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:42,480
would need to do is flip the rows, and
flip the columns,

316
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,158
such that the box in the uppe-, upper
left-hand corner,

317
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:55,330
corresponds to yes booksmart, yes varsity,
okay.

318
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:02,280
So the formula for this Is 25 over 29
divided by 15 over 20.

319
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:08,000
And so that gives us a risk ratio of about
1.15.

320
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,520
The odds ratio is defined as AD

321
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:19,260
over BC.

322
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,805
And in this case it would be the same if
we flipped the rows and columns.

323
00:22:23,805 --> 00:22:29,930
So, we can just do 25 times 5 divided by
15 times 4.

324
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:33,470
To generate a value of 2.08.

325
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:38,394
And as a review, we see that the odds
ratio in fact does.

326
00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:40,300
Inflate the risk ratio.

327
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,990
And that's the end of the exercise.

328
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:51,575
And the end of this, our module video.
