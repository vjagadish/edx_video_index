Hi and welcome to the final module on data
steps.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,630
At this point you should have all the
tools that you need to start managing your

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,340
own data sets using data steps.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,000
Here's a review.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,620
>> Remember, you always start a data step
with the word data and

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,980
you end it with the word run.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,664
And never forget, you always have to end
yours lines with a semi-colon.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,610
You can use a data line statement to
manually generate a data set by

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,140
specifying a specific values like we've
done here.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,710
You can also use the point and

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,200
click to import a data set like we showed
you earlier.

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,130
You can use a set statement to fill in
data from another data set that you

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:43,950
have already imported.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,250
>> Keep and drop statements will let you
prune down the columns.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,780
Here we've stated drop weight so

16
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,750
that we can create a new data set with the
weight variable dropped.

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,230
The retain statement will let you reorder
the variables in your data set.

18
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,460
By writing retain, id, marital and

19
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,780
eversmoke we asked to create a new data
set with these variables listed first.

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,860
>> You can use IF-THEN-ELSE statements.

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,320
To create new variables or do complex
tasks under a specific conditions.

22
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,960
You can use SELECT-END statements to do
the same thing while also checking to

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,210
make sure you have considered every case
in your data set.

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,630
>> And that's all you need to know for
now.

25
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,080
