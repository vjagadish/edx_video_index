1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:01,900
Alright so

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,750
now we're going to turn to a little bit of
an even trickier problem to solve.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,580
We're going to look at the odds ratio for
worry.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,680
So worry has a, a couple of things going
for it that make it a little tricky.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,040
Worry is continuous and we not only have
worry times family history in the model,

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,150
that interaction, we also have this worry
squared which essentially is

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,090
worry interacting with itself.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,750
So that means that the effect of worry
depends on the level of worry.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,050
To make this a little bit more tractable,
we are going to start with the situation

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,590
where we are with the women who don't have
a family history.

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,280
That means family history is going to
equal 0.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,210
That will make our lives a little bit
easier to start with.

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,997
So what's the odds ratio when fam history
is equal to 0?

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,140
What's the odds ratio for a one unit
increase in worry?

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,330
So if you go from a worry of four to a
worry of five,

16
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,130
how does that change your odds of getting
a mammography?

17
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,930
The way to represent that generally, to
make this problem doable,

18
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,690
is to say we're comparing a woman who has
a worry of worry plus 1.

19
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,360
Versus a woman who has a value for worry
of W.

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,636
That's how we're going to represent it in
the model to make this easier to solve.

21
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,210
So, I want to compare a woman who has a
higher level of

22
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,210
worry to a woman who has a lower level of
worry keeping family history at zero.

23
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,490
So what's the odds, so again,

24
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,550
in the numerator of the odds ratio we have
to put the odds, which we calculate from

25
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:26,310
the logistic regression model for a woman
with a worry plus 1 value.

26
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,220
So she gets e alpha, now, luckily family
history's 0 here.

27
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,240
So that's term is going to go to 0.

28
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,995
We are just going to hold age fixed at any
value.

29
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:36,960
I'll just call that A, it's going to
cancel.

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,020
Then we get negative 0.04 times worry plus
1,

31
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,859
W plus 1, that's going to be the woman
with higher worry going in the numerator.

32
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:51,520
We also get the squared the term, so
negative 0.03 W plus 1 squared.

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:02:00,550
And then finally, minus 0.02 oh sorry e
raised to 0.02.

34
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,750
And this woman has a family history of 0
so

35
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,010
her interaction term goes to 0 so that
term is always going to go away.

36
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,504
What about the denominator?

37
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:16,410
Well in the denominator were going to have
a lot of the same things this is 0 this

38
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,330
is this same as the numerator for age.

39
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,226
She's just going to have e raised negative
0.04 W, and

40
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:29,410
she's going to have e raised to negative
0.03 W squared.

41
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,790
Everything else will go away.

42
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,867
So we're, a lot of things are going to
cancel.

43
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:36,620
These cancel, these cancel, these cancel,
these cancel.

44
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,076
We're left with this here.

45
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:48,760
Okay so just to to give myself a little
more space to write things here,

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,730
I've copied over what we had left from the
formula from the previous slide.

47
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,360
And this is what we have left.

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:03,080
I also expanded the W plus one squared is
the same as W squared plus 2 W plus one.

49
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,950
Now some things are going to cancel.

50
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,430
So notice that we have an E raised to
negative 0.04 times W plus one.

51
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,890
Well if we expand that,

52
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:17,554
that becomes E raised to negative 0.04
minus 0.04 you are raising it to 0.04 w.

53
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:20,630
The 0.04 w cancels with the denominator so

54
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,430
are left with just e raised to negative
0.04.

55
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:31,310
And then we've got the negative 0.03 will
be distributed here.

56
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,540
And the negative 0.03 w squared will also
cancel with the denominator, so

57
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:41,350
we are left with e raised to negative 0.03
times 2 w is negative 0.06 W.

58
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,590
And then we get an negative 0.03,

59
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,430
so that's what we are left with for the
odds ratio.

60
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,420
We can go one step further here, and just
add things up.

61
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:56,064
So e raised to negative 0.04 times e
raised to negative 0.03 just becomes

62
00:03:56,064 --> 00:04:01,090
e raised to negative 0.07, and then we've
got a minus 0.06 w.

63
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:07,150
So we can see that this odds ratio is
indeed a function of worry.

64
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,310
So the effect of worry of you having
higher worry depends on worry itself, and

65
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,220
that's our final formula for that odds
ratio.

66
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,350
We can plug in some values.

67
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,210
So, for example, you're going to reach a
peak.

68
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,290
You're going to have an odds ratio of 1.0.

69
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,690
When if you put, if you just put in here,
you'll see if you put in 0.06 times

70
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,930
negative 7 6th so worry is equal to
negative 7 6th or

71
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,220
negative 1.166 that's the break even
point.

72
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,960
That when this sum is going to be equal to
1.0.

73
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,360
So all that tells you is that if you're at
a worry of level of negative 1.16,

74
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,200
and you increase your worry by one unit.

75
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,770
It's not going to change your odds.

76
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,500
So we, if you think about the curve,

77
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,070
we have a peak at a level of worry of
about negative 1.16.

78
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,130
Our, our curve on mammography so it should
peak about there.

79
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,840
We can plug in different levels of worry
just to,

80
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,950
to kind of see what you're getting.

81
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,351
So if I plug into this formula e raised to
negative 0.07 minus

82
00:05:07,351 --> 00:05:11,676
0.06 if you're at a worry level of
negative 5, that's like, very low worry,

83
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:17,290
that is going to equal e raised to 0.23
because those

84
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,800
negatives will become a positive, that's
an odds ratio of about 1.26.

85
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,620
And we saw that if you're over here in low
worry, you were,

86
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,080
as you were going up in worry, your odds
ratio is going up.

87
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,170
That's what it means to be on a curve.

88
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,440
But if we're on the other side of worry,
if we're at a positive level of worry,

89
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,690
a positive point, a positive 5 so

90
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,960
a high level of worry, this is going to be
negative 0.07 minus 0.30.

91
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,422
So that equals e raised to negative to
negative 0.37.

92
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:51,930
So that means that you're at an odds ratio
there of 0.69.

93
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,330
So if you're on the other side here this
is a worry over here,

94
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,730
you're going down the curve.

95
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,330
So as you increase in worry,

96
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,870
you're chances of getting annual
mammography actually go down.

97
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,260
So that's really representing the fact
that worry is on a curve.

98
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,810
And again, you can kind of see that in the
picture, that we're really on a curve.

99
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,130
As you're at the low levels of worry, and
again, this is for

100
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,940
the average-risk women, your odds ratios
are increased, are high.

101
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,080
We reach a peak at about negative one, and
then it starts to decrease and

102
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,540
your odds ratios go down as you're at
higher levels of worry.

103
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,370
So for the average women, at either end of
worry,

104
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,010
she's less likely to get mammography.

105
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,070
Alright so that's for the women who have a
family history of 0.

106
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,600
So just's for fun let's do the same thing
to see what

107
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,850
changes among women who have a positive
family history.

108
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,320
So one more little calculation here.

109
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,850
So now family history is equal to 1, so

110
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,990
now we have to account for that in our
odds ratio.

111
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,900
So this is for the odds ratio for a 1 unit
increase in worry.

112
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,775
So worry plus 1 versus worry.

113
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:56,900
And same logic except now we gotta worry
about the family history.

114
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,440
So the numerator is somebody how has a
family history, and so she gets that 0.14.

115
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,888
Again we are going to hold age fixed, so
that doesn't matter.

116
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:09,930
And now for her worry.

117
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,590
So, let's put her again.

118
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,520
We're going to leave worry as a general
term here.

119
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,584
So, negative 0.04 times worry plus 1.

120
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:24,280
E raise the negative 0.03, worry plus 1
squared.

121
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,720
All the same as before, but now we have to
worry about the interactions term

122
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,640
because she has a family history, and she
has worry of some amount.

123
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,800
So she is going to get this e raised to
negative 0.02 times w plus 1.

124
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,450
Her, actually, her worry is w plus 1, so
this will become w plus 1 again.

125
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,360
What about in the denominator?

126
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,080
See how a lot of things are the same as
before but

127
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,650
now we've got somebody with a positive
family history.

128
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,820
She gets a one there.

129
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,340
Same with the age.

130
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:02,910
She gets a value of W for worry and a
value of W squared for worry squared,

131
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:08,210
and she has a value of W for worry.

132
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,600
So that's going to be negative 0.02 just
times w.

133
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,940
Well, a lot of things are going to cancel.

134
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,880
So the, the alphas still cancer, cancel.

135
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,880
Notice that the main effect for family
history is the same.

136
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,820
They both have family histories.

137
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,980
So that main effect cancels, although the
interaction will remain.

138
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,870
The age of course cancels as we've seen
before.

139
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,940
This component right in here well
thankfully [LAUGH] That looks like

140
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,540
exactly the same formula we just solved.

141
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,140
So the only thing that's changing in this
picture now is this last term.

142
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,249
So remember that we just showed that all
of this

143
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:46,820
simplifies down to E minus 0.4 minus 0.6
W.

144
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:49,979
But now we've got this additional term.

145
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:51,720
So what does this turn out to be?

146
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,507
E raised to negative 0.02, we can
distribute the negative 0.02.

147
00:08:55,507 --> 00:08:57,787
Well, the negative 0.02 w will cancel, so

148
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,547
we're just left with an additional
negative 0.02.

149
00:09:00,547 --> 00:09:04,670
So we can say that now oops and this
should have been a value of 0.07.

150
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:10,350
Sorry, from before, so that became
negative 0.07 minus 0.06 w from before.

151
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:16,230
And so she now gets negative 0.09 minus
0.06 W.

152
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,690
So, that's our general formula for a woman
who has a positive family history.

153
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,960
It's different.

154
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,180
Notice that all we changed here is that
she has the interaction term

155
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,220
whereas somebody who does not have a
family history does not get

156
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,680
that additional interaction term.

157
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,400
So we just differ here by e raised to
negative 0.02.

158
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,750
All that this is going to have the effect
of

159
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,820
is that it's going to slightly change the
curve, as we saw in the picture.

160
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,314
So her break point for

161
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:49,910
the peak of her curve will occur not at
negative 7 out of 6.

162
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,540
But it will occur out of, at negative 9
6th.

163
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,350
So for the peak will be slightly, if you
look at the peak, the peak for

164
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,600
the women for the average risk was at
about negative 1.

165
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,940
The peak for the women with the higher
risk is going to be at about negative 1.5.

166
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,540
So that's, you're going to see a different
peak.

167
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,220
And that we already saw the picture, which
I will show you again in a second here.

168
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,800
And, you can calculate then at various
levels of worry

169
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,430
what the odds ratio will be.

170
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,472
You're going to see the same general
pattern that is the, you are going to be

171
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:26,990
increasing your chances of mammography,
your odds are going to be positive in

172
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,610
the negative values of worry and then,
then after you get, after you get

173
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,150
past this peak, as worry increases, the
odds ratios are going to go down.

174
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,130
So same general pattern, slightly
different peak, slightly different curve.

175
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,390
And you can see that in fact the women who
were high-risk, that's the solid line,

176
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,920
indeed their peak occurred lower than the
women who were average-risk.

177
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,670
That's represented in this general
formula.

178
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,930
So this now we've gone through and

179
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,670
seen how to calculate odds ratios in the
presence of interaction.

180
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,860
We've done some really tough ones in this
problem.

181
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,970
Hopefully the ones where we just have two
binary predictors interacting now will

182
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,060
seem really simple to you.
