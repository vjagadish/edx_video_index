1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,060
All right.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,620
Now, this is part two of the VDJ
recombination story.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,380
And part two is the mechanism of VDJ
recombination.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,100
[BLANK_AUDIO]

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,060
What happens in VDJ recombination is there
is going to be recombi, recombinant,

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,170
combinations to bring a D segment next to
a J segment and a V next to a DJ segment.

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,950
So we're going to show that, and of course
all these segments, there are many other d

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,820
segments and many other J segments and
many other V segments, we're just going to

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,920
talk about the chosen ones and use hash
marks here to indicate that there's some

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,190
indeterminate amount of space between
these segments that I've drawn.

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,990
There are two kinds of recombination
signal sequences which are denoted in

12
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,200
blue, here, ver, and red.

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,000
And each of those recombination signal
sequences is really DNA

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,990
sequence denoted by a triangle.

15
00:00:53,990 --> 00:01:00,280
So, in the red, let's say, that really
stands for the following type of sequence.

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,107
That.

17
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:03,256
[BLANK_AUDIO]

18
00:01:03,256 --> 00:01:12,680
There are two conserved sequences,
represented by the red.

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,202
And one is a sevenmer.

20
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:19,942
A seven nucleotide, seven base pair
sequence, and

21
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:25,128
one is a nine nucleotide sequence, and
they're separated by a spacer.

22
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:30,906
And in the reds, for example, that spacer
could be twelve nucleotides.

23
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,674
All right.

24
00:01:32,674 --> 00:01:33,580
Twelve nucleotide spacer.

25
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,930
And then the blue segment is exactly like
the red segment with one exception.

26
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,855
It also has a sevenmer, and a ninemer, or

27
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:56,120
nonomer or heptomer and nonomer, separated
by a spacer.

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,780
But that spacer is different.

29
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,880
That spacer is 23 base pairs long.

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,560
So I'll put a 23 there.

31
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:10,170
And so this thing, these things are called
recombination signal sequence

32
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,670
dash 23 and recombination signal

33
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:21,630
sequence dash 12, to indicate the
difference is only in the spacers.

34
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:27,830
And VDJ recombination always occurs
between an RSS-23 and an RSS-12.

35
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,830
So that's the 12/23 rule.

36
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,310
The reason for that rule is that the
first,

37
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,190
the first mobile element to hop in to the
vertebrate genome.

38
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:46,670
I'm going to show you that, say, say this
was, this was the original mobile element.

39
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,990
And remember the mobile element hopped in.

40
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,700
And any mobile element hopped in can also
hop out.

41
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,700
And, so this particular mobile element
hops out.

42
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:02,120
And it came in with one RSS-12 and one
RSS-23 and it hops out in the same way.

43
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,160
It excises itself because RAG-1 and RAG-2
for

44
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:16,045
example encode an integrase that's also a
disintegrase that allows it to hop out.

45
00:03:16,045 --> 00:03:22,201
So, let me erase this bracket just to show
you that when,

46
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:30,820
when this thing pops out, RAG-1 and RAG-2
will do a cleavage at two points.

47
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,200
All right?
And that cleavage at the two points

48
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:39,890
leads to four different ends from two
different double strand cuts,

49
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,980
and those four ends now have to be
rejoined.

50
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,430
Let me sort of show a blow up of one of
those two, of those cuts.

51
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,810
So here's a blow up of the cut.

52
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,909
It's going to be a little bit.

53
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:02,680
All right, and, I'm just going to separate
the DNA there to show the cut.

54
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,160
[BLANK_AUDIO]

55
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,180
Okay, there's the cut there.

56
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,040
And there is going to be a cut here.

57
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,300
And the cut is going to be there.

58
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,582
And now I'm going to draw for you the new
cut over here.

59
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:26,835
So, there's a cut at these two locations
that, that occurred with the cleavage.

60
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:30,895
And now we've got ends that are free

61
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:36,334
four different ends that have been created
by the cleavage event.

62
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:41,039
And, what happens now, is that the
non-homologous and

63
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:46,136
joining proteins, I'll, I'll draw an arrow
here for you,

64
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:51,528
the non-homologous and joining proteins
will take these ends,

65
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:55,665
and join them in a way that recombines the
genome.

66
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:59,975
And, and the reas, and they're going to
only join them in a particular order.

67
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:06,520
They're going to take the J segment and
the D segment and join them,

68
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,828
and the two recombination signal sequence
ends and join them.

69
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:16,804
And the reason it's going to do it that
way is because, RAG-1 and RAG-2,

70
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:21,162
after making the cleavage, end up bound to
the recombination signal sequences to

71
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:25,640
prevent the joining of those two ends for
a little bit, to delay the joining.

72
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,600
So, that the only two ends that can be
joined are D to J.

73
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,170
So, as a result of that joining event.

74
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,793
[BLANK_AUDIO]

75
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:35,018
You get the following.

76
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:38,754
[BLANK_AUDIO]

77
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:45,851
You get the D segment joined to the J
segment.

78
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:46,801
Okay.

79
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:52,902
And then of course, the DNA extends out
here,

80
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:56,821
and the DNA extends out here.

81
00:05:56,821 --> 00:06:00,715
And, the rest of the genome is upstream.

82
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:02,269
Let's put that in there.

83
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:09,472
[BLANK_AUDIO]

84
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:13,812
Here's the upstream V region ready for
recombination.

85
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:16,643
And, at the same time, this, this,

86
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:21,861
the DNA that's been excised from the
genome, containing the two

87
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:27,095
recombination signal sequences now becomes
available for joining.

88
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:32,799
And the two ends there are joined in the
following way so

89
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:38,379
that the blue segment and the red segment
get joined so

90
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:41,987
that you get a junction like this.

91
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:52,280
[SOUND] So the excision comes out as a
circle.

92
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,628
And in the absence of non-homologous end
joining, of course,

93
00:06:56,628 --> 00:07:01,070
the excision looks like excision of a, a
mobile element.

94
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,887
But because non-homologous end joining is
out there cleaning up the ends,

95
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:09,970
it'll just take the excised segment and
join the two ends.

96
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,858
So you have two pieces of DNA.

97
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:17,999
You have the intact chromosome which

98
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:24,845
I'll designate here, and you have a
circle.

99
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:29,657
And, the chromosome is now the
immunoglobulin heavy chain,

100
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,770
after D to J joining has occurred.

101
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,650
And what happens next of course, is V to
DJ joining.

102
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,370
And you just go through the whole thing
all over again.

103
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,210
So that is a quick overview of the
mechanism of VDJ recombination.

104
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:44,710
Thank you.
