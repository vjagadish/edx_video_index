00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,041
[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:06,283
In this next module,

3
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:10,665
I'm going to give a brief introduction to
an overview of survival analysis.

4
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:12,842
[BLANK_AUDIO]

5
00:00:12,842 --> 00:00:14,342
So, by way of introduction,

6
00:00:14,342 --> 00:00:18,250
I'm going to start with a historical
example of survival analysis.

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,330
This is when of the,

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,220
one of the first survival curves that you
can find in history.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,490
This was drawn in 1669, and what this
mathematician did,

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,470
is he said, out of 100 people, how, when
do people die?

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,160
How long do, do people survive?

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,260
This is a survival curve, and what we're
showing here is the percent surviving

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,980
at any given age And these are ages on the
x-axis.

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,760
And you can see pretty quickly that
longevity in 1669 was not so good.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,800
So if you started with 100 people who were
born, that's age zero.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,696
By age six, if you scroll up here, about a
third of them had died by age six.

17
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:04,096
Only about two-thirds, a little less than
two-thirds,

18
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,747
64% are still surviving at around age 6.

19
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:10,568
If you go up to age 16, it's only 40% of
people surviving.

20
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:15,378
So, less than half of people made it to
age 16 back in 1669.

21
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:18,230
It's really a tribute to to modern
medicine.

22
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,300
If you look at age 20, it's only about a
third of people surviving.

23
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,340
At age 26, it's only about a quarter of
people surviving, by age 36,

24
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,260
five-sixths of people had died, and only
about a sixth,

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:37,682
one-sixth of people made it past age 36
back in, past age 36 back in 1669.

26
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:41,069
So, the survival odds were not great
living back then.

27
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,884
Again, really good tribute here to modern
medicine.

28
00:01:45,884 --> 00:01:48,634
But this is an early example of a survival
curve, and this is

29
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:52,920
the kind of curve that we're going to be
looking at in survival analysis.

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,460
So we can ask all sorts of questions about
this curve.

31
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,610
So, for example, what's the shape of this
survival curve?

32
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,490
It turns out that this survival curve
corresponds to an exponential function.

33
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,087
We'll see that later today.

34
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:08,960
So we can define an actual mathematical
function that defines the survival curve.

35
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,850
We can also just ask, you know, about
particular survival probabilities.

36
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,850
What's the, what's a person's chance of
surviving past age 20?

37
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,850
Well, there's only, in this case, about a,
a 33% chance.

38
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,270
What was the probability of surviving past
age 36?

39
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,245
There's only about a 16% chance.

40
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:29,258
When we do Kaplan-Meier statistics,

41
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:32,857
what we're actually going to be doing is
just defining the curve based on

42
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:36,110
the probabilities of surviving past
particular time points.

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,087
And this is really what survival analysis
is.

44
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:42,468
We're trying to estimate this curve, but
the outcome for

45
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:46,226
survival analysis doesn't necessarily have
to be death.

46
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:50,780
You'll see that, of course, survival
analysis was built, the, the tools were

47
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,400
built, with time to death in mind, so a
lot of the terminology makes it, you know,

48
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,020
always talks about survival and failure
but in fact, the methods will work for

49
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,460
any binary event, it doesn't just have to
be death.

50
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,490
So we'll see some examples in a minute
that are not just death.

51
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,770
Some of what we care about in survival
analysis is drawing this curve or

52
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,310
defining this curve, but a lot of times
what we care more about is not just, you

53
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,470
know, what does this curve look like, but
we might want to compare different curves.

54
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,650
So for example, we could put the curve
for, you know, today's survival rates and

55
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,278
compare it to survival in 1669.

56
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:29,944
So a lot of times what we're interested
in, more so

57
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:31,680
than just drawing these curves,

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,279
is actually to compare different groups
with respect to their survival experience.

59
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:38,677
[SOUND].

60
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,669
Just to give you an example, a more modern
example,

61
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:47,008
this these are data from the Women's
Health Initiative, which came out in 2002.

62
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:52,480
This was a very important study, because
they randomized post-menopausal women,

63
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,816
to either take hormone-replacement therapy
or, a placebo pill.

64
00:03:56,816 --> 00:04:00,749
And, the results were very, were very
surprising at that time because people had

65
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:03,599
thought that hormone replacement therapy
protected women

66
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,805
against coronary heart disease, which is
what's shown here.

67
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:11,485
And in fact, you can see that these graphs
are pretty intuitive to interpret, that,

68
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:16,165
this is showing you the cumulative risk of
getting coronary heart disease over time,

69
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:20,280
and the hormone group is, has a higher
risk than the placebo group.

70
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,640
So in fact it turned out, that the hormone
replacement therapy actually increased,

71
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,180
not decreased, the risk of coronary heart
disease in post menopausal women and,

72
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,520
that was surprising and actually resulted
in the, the study being halted early.

73
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,500
You can see that in the last slide I
showed you an example of

74
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,710
a survival curve where we started at sort
of 100% survival and dropped off.

75
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,900
A lot of times you'll see survival curves
starting at 100% and

76
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,890
dropping down from there.

77
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,562
You also may see survival curves like
this, which show you, the starting at

78
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:56,841
0% and showing you the cumulative total of
people who develop some kind of disease.

79
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:59,976
It doesn't really matter which direction
you put the curve in but

80
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:04,194
when you have an outcome that's relatively
rare, you know, coronary heart disease,

81
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:08,412
you can see 1 or 2, 3%, a relatively rare
outcome it might be better to describe it,

82
00:05:08,412 --> 00:05:11,718
or to draw it as a cumulative hazard
because if you start at 100%,

83
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:14,020
you're not going to go down very much.

84
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,742
But you'll see the curves drawn in both
ways.

85
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:17,844
I'll just note here,

86
00:05:17,844 --> 00:05:21,556
that we're going to be talking about
something called the hazard ratio

87
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:25,043
that's also printed on this little graphic
in this particular study.

88
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:29,039
The hazard ratio, which is very similar to
a relative risk, for

89
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,147
coronary heart disease if you compared
women on,

90
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:37,430
in the hormone group to women in the
placebo group, the hazard ratio was 1.29.

91
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,812
The way that you would interpret that is
that there was a 29% higher rate of the,

92
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:47,750
of coronary heart disease in the hormone
group versus the placebo group.

93
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,300
So what is survival analysis?

94
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,810
It's a set of statistical tools that are
used for analyzing time-to-event data.

95
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,160
And I'll talk about exactly what
time-to-event data is in just a second

96
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,230
here, but because we're waiting for events
to occur, we're measuring things over

97
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,390
time, we're generally going to be dealing
with data that have been collected over

98
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,930
time, that is, either from a randomized
clinical trial or from a cohort study.

99
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,880
You actually need to know the exact timing
of when things occurred,

100
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,070
when events occurred.

101
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,070
So, time-to-event variables are actually a
two-part outcome variable.

102
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,700
There's two pieces to it, and in our data
set we'll actually store this

103
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,660
outcome variable as two separate
variables.

104
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,570
So, there is a time part.

105
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,990
The time part of a time-to-event variable,

106
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,250
records the amount of time that a person
was in the study,

107
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,860
until they either had the event, or, they
were what we call censored.

108
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,560
And by censored we mean, that, we stopped
following them for whatever reason,

109
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,080
but the last time we saw them, they had
not had the event of interest.

110
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,830
So you either, again the time part is
either the time until the event, or

111
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,909
the time until censored.

112
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,320
And then there's a binary variable that
tells us whether or

113
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,300
not that person had the event.

114
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,650
Some people will have the event.

115
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,540
Some people will develop coronary heart
disease during the study.

116
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,328
Some people will not.

117
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,026
So, this binary variable records whether
or

118
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:15,789
not a person had the event or, whether
they were censored, and

119
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:20,411
again censored means that the last time we
saw them, they were event free.

120
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:23,141
[BLANK_AUDIO]

121
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:24,841
So we, it's a two-variable outcome,

122
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:28,375
we actually need two separate variables in
our data set to store this information.

123
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:33,115
The time variable gives us the time at
which a person had their event, or

124
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:38,012
the, at the last time where we saw them
and they had not yet had the event.

125
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:42,107
And we also need a censoring variable,
which is just a binary variable that

126
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:46,214
tells us, yes they had the event, or no
they did not, they were censored.

127
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:49,380
So just to illustrate, let me throw it in,
a simple example here.

128
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,120
So here's some data on time to conception,

129
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,900
just to show you that survival analysis
doesn't always have to have a bad outcome.

130
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,390
So this was some data on 38 women who, all
of them had some kind of treatment for

131
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,660
infertility, so this is a single cohort,
one group of women.

132
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,890
They all had the same treatment.

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,090
They were followed for up to two years,
and the event of inter-,

134
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,360
interest here was conception.

135
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,750
These were women who wanted to get
pregnant, so again, it's a happy outcome.

136
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,260
So, time to a conception is the outcome
here.

137
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,830
Just to show you what the data looked like
from that study, it's again,

138
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,970
a two-variable outcome variable.

139
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,510
So we have Time and we have Event.

140
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,610
So the Time, again, tells us the amount of
time they were in the study until they

141
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,490
got pregnant, or until they were censored,
we lost them to follow-up.

142
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,450
The event variable tells us whether or not
they got pregnant or,

143
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,820
whether the last time we saw them, they
were not yet pregnant.

144
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,960
So, as an example, this person here was in
the study for

145
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,370
two months before they got pregnant.

146
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,100
She did get pregnant in the second cycle,
the second month.

147
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,680
Contrast that down here to this person.

148
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,140
This person was in the study for four
months but she did not get pregnant,

149
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,190
so after four months we don't know what
happened to her.

150
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,980
She was probably lost to follow-up, we no
longer have any data on her,

151
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,570
she quit the study for whatever reason we,
we don't know what

152
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,260
happened after four months so, she
contributes just four months to the study,

153
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,510
we at least know that for four months she
was, pregnancy free in this case.

154
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,990
All of the examples that we're going to
deal with in this class are going to

155
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:26,010
have right censoring, which is the most
common type of censoring.

156
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,420
So right censoring means that you censor
somebody because the study ended, and

157
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,720
at the time the study ended, they still
had not had the event.

158
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,220
Or, because something else happened to
them like they died due to something that

159
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,160
wasn't the event of interest.

160
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,090
So they died before they got pregnant, or
before they had coronary heart disease, so

161
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,460
something else that takes them out of the
study, at, but at the last time we

162
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,770
saw them, they had not yet had the event,
or they were lost to follow-up,

163
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,690
because of course with longitudinal
studies, sometimes people move, they just

164
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,360
decide not to participate anymore, you
lose a good amount of people to follow up.

165
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,380
So all of those would be reasons that
people might be censored.

166
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,710
These are all right censoring because,
right censoring means that we know that

167
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:11,860
the subject survived event free, at least
up til time T.

168
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,650
They may or

169
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:18,310
may not have gone on to later have the
event, to the right of, of that time.

170
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,430
This is in contrast to left censoring.

171
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,710
In left censoring, the event would've
already happened before people

172
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,350
joined the study, and we don't necessarily
know exactly when it happened, but those

173
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,290
examples are less common and we're not
going to deal with those in this class.

174
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,424
Everything here is going to be right
sensored.

175
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,784
Now if you're just looking at the data
the, for

176
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:39,324
the first time seeing time-to-event
outcomes, you might just say,

177
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:42,360
well, okay, why use survival analysis at
all?

178
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,670
I've got a continuous outcome here, time.

179
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,300
So why not just compare the times, the
mean times or

180
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,010
the median times, between the different
groups using, say a T test or

181
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,490
a linear regression which we already know
about.

182
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,350
So of course the problem with that, just
looking at the time,

183
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,350
is you gotta remember that not everybody
is going to have the event in your study.

184
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,770
So you need to account for the censoring.

185
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:08,340
If you just looked at the mean times and
compared those mean times between groups,

186
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,510
you would ignore the fact that some people
had the event and

187
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,080
some people were censored.

188
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,329
So that's not going to be sufficient.

189
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,320
You might also ask, well, okay, I've got a
binary outcome here, and sure, you know,

190
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,750
some people took longer to get to that
outcome than others, but, why not just

191
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,560
compare the proportion of people who have
events in all the different groups and

192
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,270
use logistic regression like we did
previously?

193
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,160
And, of course, the problem here is, that,
it ignores the time element.

194
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,510
So, yes, some people had events and

195
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,410
some people didn't and we could just look
at those proportions, with risk ratios,

196
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,390
odds ratios, logistic regression, but that
would ignore the time.

197
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,000
And, the time may make a difference,
right?

198
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,170
If somebody dies two days into your study,
and

199
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,500
somebody else dies ten years into your
study, that's a huge difference.

200
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,520
If we only looked at death, yes or no,
we'd be completely ignoring that

201
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,320
time part, and losing a whole bunch of
information.

202
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,470
We'd be reducing our statistical power and
precision.

203
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,200
So this way, with survival analysis, we're
able to incorporate both the time part and

204
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,620
the binary yes or no they had the event,
or they didn't.

205
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,820
The basic test that we're going to be
using for survival analysis, again,

206
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,270
this is when we have time-to-event
outcomes, this very special kind of

207
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,540
outcome, you could use what are called
just basic rate ratios if you

208
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,830
don't want to do any adjustment and, and
there's only two groups.

209
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,460
For something a little more fancy, you can
do Kaplan-Meier statistics, but

210
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,360
those are not going to be adjusted for
anything so that just allows you

211
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,000
to compare groups without adjusting for
any kind of confounding.

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,890
If you want to do any kind of regression,
we're going to be doing either, some kind

213
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:47,070
of parametric survival model, which I'm
going to talk about briefly this week,

214
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,240
or you can do cox regression which we're
going to spend more time on.

215
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,140
Those are the multi variant regression
techniques when

216
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,972
you have time-to-event outcomes.

217
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,000
And just to give you a little overview of
those tests which we're going to go

218
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,204
into in great detail in upcoming modules,
just to kind of frame them all together,

219
00:13:03,204 --> 00:13:07,690
Kaplan-Meier statistics is what we call a
non-parametric method.

220
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,180
So all that means is that we're not
going to make any assumptions about

221
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,930
the survival curve.

222
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,900
We're going to try to draw the survival
curve,

223
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,960
but we're going to just draw what we see
in our data.

224
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,890
We're not going to assume it follows any
particular mathematical function.

225
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,780
We're not going to be estimating any
parameters, so

226
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,960
that means we're not going to be
estimating hazard ratios or

227
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,930
anything like that.

228
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,480
We're just going to get these pictures of
curves and get a p-value.

229
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,850
No, no, nothing else.

230
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,000
So we call that non-parametric.

231
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,940
We're not estimating any parameters.

232
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,680
Parametric survival occurs, as you can,
guess, they're completely parametric.

233
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,930
This would mean that we're estimating all
the possible param-, all,

234
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,460
all the possible parameters.

235
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,990
So that means we're actually going to try
to,

236
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,765
to fit a per-, perfect mathematical
function to the different survival curves.

237
00:13:48,765 --> 00:13:54,400
And, we're going to, not only compare the
curves, that, in different groups,

238
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,980
but we're also going to try to define the
underlying curve.

239
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,410
What's the shape of that curve?

240
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,610
We're going to estimate all possible
parameters essentially.

241
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,200
Now Cox regression is kind of a compromise
between those two.

242
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,720
So in Cox regression,

243
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,270
we're not going to bother to try to
estimate what's the shape of the curve.

244
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,370
So we don't want to make any assumptions.

245
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,490
We don't have to make any assumptions
therefore,

246
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,650
about the underlying survival curve, what
that shape it follows.

247
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,188
But we are going to try to say what is the
difference between two groups in

248
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:24,411
their curves, without actually drawing or
estimating that underlying curve.

249
00:14:24,411 --> 00:14:27,962
So we're going to be estimating some
parameters, hazard ratios, which compare

250
00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:31,672
different groups without saying anything
about the underlying survival curve.

251
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:35,996
So that's called semi-parametric because
it's kind of in between the other two.

252
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:40,716
