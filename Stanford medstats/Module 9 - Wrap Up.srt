00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:26,030
Hi, I'm Dr. Larry Chu.

3
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,830
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Lauren Cornella.

4
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,733
>> And I'm Dr. John Fox.

5
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:32,000
>> [SOUND] Well in this segment,

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,910
it's really our chance to say good bye to
you as sad as that is.

7
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,220
I've had a fantastic time doing this
course.

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,280
I know that you guys have gotten a lot out
of it and

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,120
that you are feeling more prepared for
your cardiac anesthesia rotation.

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,360
Lauren on behalf of the cardiac anesthesia
team here, do you have any last words for

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,720
our students before we send them on their
way?

12
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,970
>> Well, we know this course has provided
a really good introduction to

13
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,130
the cardiac anesthesia pod.

14
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,530
I think that some last tips of advice
maybe would be

15
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,790
to take everything you can from this
rotation.

16
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,540
I think you're going to learn a ton.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,640
I think you're going to really take care
of, patients really well and

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,620
you're going to learn a lot of techniques
and

19
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,530
tips and knowledge that's going to take
you even in your non-cardiac OR rotations.

20
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,430
I think something you'll find across the
board about your rotation is

21
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,940
that everyone will be very happy to teach
you.

22
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,460
Cardiac anesthesia attending fellows are
really looking forward to teaching you.

23
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,790
There's so much to learn and so I think
you're going to learn a lot.

24
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,790
I think you'll also find that everyone
else in the room will be

25
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,310
really receptive to teaching you as well.

26
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,500
I know that the fusionists have really
taught me a lot.

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,780
The nurses know a lot of information and
so

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,800
really try to get the most you can from
every single day and every single case.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,590
And on behalf of everyone, we wish you
well.

30
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,420
We know you're going to love it.

31
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,520
>> Wonderful.

32
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,930
Well, again, it's been a blast.

33
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,400
I can't wait to do this again,

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,770
maybe on a different cardiac anesthesia
course in the future to come, hopefully.

35
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,080
And we'll see you later.

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,372
Have fun in cardiac anesthesia rotation.

37
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:15,372
