1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,880
In this next module I'm going to tell you
about the mathematical connection between

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,120
the Mantel-Haenszel tests.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,880
Which we learned about this week.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,980
And McNemar's test which we talked about
last week.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,590
These two different methods are going to
come at the same problem from two

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,920
completely different approaches, and yet

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,780
converge on exactly the same mathematical
answer.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,260
Which I think is just really cool and

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,610
will also give you some insight into both
methods.

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,910
I'm going to start with an example that we
talked about last week,

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,500
when we talked about McNemar's test.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,780
So, this was a particular example where we
had paired data.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,990
For each case, a control was matched to
the case, based on age and gender.

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,510
So, we have case control pairs, and we
needed to account for

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,130
that correlation in those case control
pairs.

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,400
The question here was whether or not,
having a heart attack.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,030
The cases here had all had a heart attack.

18
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,570
Whether or not that was related to having
a history of diabetes.

19
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,540
So remember that we had to present this as
paired data.

20
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,540
So what we did was we presented it as 144
pairs rather than 288 individuals.

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,436
And then we apply what's called McNemar's
test that was just a chi-square test with

22
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:12,200
one degree of freedom.

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,660
And it had a simple form which was just to
do b minus c squared over b plus c.

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,030
And when we applied that here,

25
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:25,770
it turned out to be 37 minus 16 squared
divided by 53, and that turned

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,960
out to be highly statistically significant
of chi-square value of about 8.3.

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,230
So that was how we adjusted for

28
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,840
the correlation he took into account the
correlation using McNemar's test.

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,340
Now, I want to approach this particular
problem from

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,820
a completely different, perspective.

31
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,750
So what if, instead of counting for the
pairing that way.

32
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:55,760
What if we, instead, envisioned each pair
as its own age gender stratum.

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,930
So remember, we've matched here on age and
gender.

34
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,150
So in a way,

35
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,190
you could view each pair as just having
its own unique age-gender combination.

36
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,360
And you could think of it almost as a
confounder,

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,660
which pair you're in could be thought of
as a confounder in this problem.

38
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,530
It's a really interesting way to think of
it,

39
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,120
because of course, if we're going to
stratify on pair.

40
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,150
We're going to end up with some very small
two by two tables.

41
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,420
But that's okay.

42
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,550
I'm going to show you that we can still do
this kind of stratification and

43
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,000
calculate mantle hansel statistics.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,830
So let me just explain exactly what I
mean, here.

45
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,900
So, what we're going to do for example, is
take the cell As.

46
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,300
These were the situations, cell A was the
situation where we had pairs where,

47
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,399
both, the case and the control had a
history of diabetes.

48
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,670
What if you represented that as its own
two by two table,

49
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,150
it's own stratum, in this analysis?

50
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,620
Again, kind of thinking of which pair
you're in as being the confounder here,

51
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,630
stratifying on which pair you're in.

52
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,140
It makes a very funny two by two table,
because we only have,

53
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,550
our total here is only two people, because
it's a pair.

54
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,310
But we can do this.

55
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,190
And so just bear with me.

56
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,130
It's going to all make sense in a bit.

57
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,770
So in this case, how do we represent.

58
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,140
We're now going back to representing the
people as individuals.

59
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,300
So the two represents two individuals
rather than two pairs now.

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,770
So both the case and the control had a
history of diabetes.

61
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,790
So, both of them are going to get a one
for diabetes, and both of

62
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,660
them are going to get, and there's nobody
here who had, who didn't have diabetes.

63
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,270
So, we get zeroes in the other two cells.

64
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,010
Very simple two by two table, but we can
draw that out.

65
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,620
All of the cell A's, all of the pairs
where both the case and

66
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,410
the control had diabetes, are going to
have the exact same two by two table.

67
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,100
It's going to look like that.

68
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,100
And then, we can go ahead and do this
logic.

69
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,480
Across all the different types of pairs.

70
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,260
We only have four unique types of pairs
here.

71
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,310
So, we have, again, nine pairs where both
the case and the control had diabetes.

72
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,450
That can be represented in the top, the
two-by-two table you see in the top here.

73
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,360
What about the situation where we have
discordant pairs where it's the case

74
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,830
that has diabetes and the control that
doesn't?

75
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,600
That can be represented in the second type
of two by two table.

76
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,748
Right, there's again only two people in
each stratum and in this case,

77
00:04:02,748 --> 00:04:07,304
the case has diabetes so we have one case
with diabetes and we have one control who

78
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:11,950
does not have diabetes and none of the
other types of people in this case.

79
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,860
We have 37 dischord appears in the case
that's diabetic.

80
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,040
So that's what those strata are going to
look like.

81
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,270
We get the opposite situation of
discordance,

82
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:25,210
where it's the control that has diabetes
in the case that does not.

83
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,730
Again, two total in that strata.

84
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,910
There's 16 of those strata that look like
that.

85
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,670
And then finally we have the situation, we
have 82 pairs where both the case and

86
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,130
the control do not have diabetes and

87
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,770
those would be represented in this two by
two table.

88
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:46,061
So we can write this out as a huge
stratified analysis with 144 different

89
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:49,430
strata, of course you don't really want to
have write this all by, out by hand, but

90
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,430
since a lot of the, strata look the same,
we can kind of just move them like this.

91
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,110
Alright, now, how are we going to apply
Mandel-Handel statistics, to these,

92
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,740
to this stratified analysis?

93
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,270
Well we're going to

94
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,070
apply it with the exact same formulas that
we learned this week.

95
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,900
So let's apply the Mantel-Haenszel methods
to those, all those different strata.

96
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,670
We want to know the relationship between
diabetes and heartattack, controlling for

97
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,290
age and gender.

98
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,280
The matching variable, so essentially we
are adjusting for hair here.

99
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,230
So we're going to apply the
Mantel-Haenszel methods to

100
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,160
the stratified data.

101
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,040
So, how does that look like?

102
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,410
What I'm going to start with here is I'm
going to

103
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,660
start by calculating the Mantel-Haenszel
summary odds ratio just because it is

104
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,340
slightly simpler to calculate.

105
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:35,790
So just recall, from an earlier module,
the Mantel-Haenszel Summary Odds Ratio

106
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:41,010
was just a weighted average of the odds
ratios across all the different strata.

107
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,540
So in this case, we're going to have 100
and k is going to be equal to 144.

108
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,460
You have 144 strata.

109
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,830
We're going to sum up a times d.

110
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,480
Divided by the total in each stratum,

111
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,460
which is going to be two in every case
here.

112
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,970
We're going to do that, for the numerator
and we're going to do

113
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,820
something similar for the denominator
except it's going to be the b times c.

114
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,190
So, again the total with two in each
stratum.

115
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,680
So, we can just do that here so let's
actually go ahead and apply this.

116
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,310
So, what about in the first situation?

117
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,940
We've got the case [INAUDIBLE] control,
both have diabetes.

118
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,860
So what, what's a times b in this
situation?

119
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,970
Well, it's going to be 1 times 0, so a
times b, ant the total here is 2.

120
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,930
For every, each one of those strata where
we've got concordance on diabetes.

121
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,060
You're going to have it a times d, is
equal to 0, and

122
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,640
divided by 2 is still equal to 0.

123
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,430
B times c, 1 times 0, is also going to be,
0, so we're going to get 0's.

124
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,680
So, essentially, those dis, those
concorded pairs are not going to

125
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,220
contribute anything to the Mantel-Haenszel
odds ratio.

126
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,598
We know that the concord impair should not
contribute because they're

127
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:44,712
not informative.

128
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,440
Alright what about this situation where we
have a discord up here with

129
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,930
a diabetic case, what would that look
like?

130
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,640
Well again where going to do a times d and

131
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,880
now we get 1 times 1 divided by the total
here which is 2.

132
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,060
So now we actually get a number a times d
divided by two here is going to be a half.

133
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,530
B times c because we got two zeros now is
going to be zero.

134
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,930
For the discord up here where it is the
control that has diabetes.

135
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,000
A times d is now going to be zero, but

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,330
b times c is going to be one over two, so
we get another half here.

137
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,080
So those discordant strata are going to
contribute to

138
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,190
the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio.

139
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,820
Finally, though, those situations where we
have the pair both don't have diabetes,

140
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,420
those are both going to give us zeroes
again.

141
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,890
So again, the concordant pairs are not
going to contribute to

142
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,000
the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,240
Now let's just calculate that
Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio.

144
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,480
Again, we have many, many strata here, but
they all look the same.

145
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,010
So we can just multiply by how frequently
each of these different strata occurs.

146
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,640
There was 37 discordant pairs where the
case was diabetic, and

147
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,440
16 where the control was diabetic.

148
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,320
So now we're just going to plug into the
Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio formula.

149
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,500
Again, we get a half everywhere where
we've got that, discordant but

150
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,110
cases diabetic, there were 37 of those, we
get a half in the denominator from these

151
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,670
pairs where we had discordance, but it was
the control who was diabetic, so

152
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,050
we get 37 times a half divided by 16 times
a half.

153
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,170
The halves cancel.

154
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,590
We just end up with 37 divided by 16 or b
over c.

155
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,420
That's the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio.

156
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,490
So it works out to be exactly the same as
the McNemar odds

157
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,390
ratio as we saw from last week.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,205
Now just slightly more tricky is to
actually apply the Mantel Haenszel

159
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:34,290
chi-squared statistic that you learned
about this week.

160
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,300
So what does that look like?

161
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,390
So here's the formula, first of all, that
I gave you earlier this week.

162
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,470
We're going to be comparing observed minus
expected for that A cell, and

163
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,860
then we've got this variance.

164
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,780
It was a little complicated to calculate
the variance.

165
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,590
I'll show you how to apply it here.

166
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,510
The expected value is like we calculate
for and MH chi-square.

167
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,190
So this is the formula for the Mantle
Hansel chi-square.

168
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,910
What are we actually testing in this
situation?

169
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:05,460
So the null hypothesis here would be that
diabetes and heart attack

170
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:11,280
are independent after we adjust for, or
control for, which pier you're in.

171
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,380
So we can apply that statistic here, and
again, because a lot of the strata look

172
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,630
the same, it's not going to be as bad as
you might anticipated.

173
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,270
I'm going to show you that what we come
out with is exactly equal to

174
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,290
the McNemar's chi-squared.

175
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,340
All right.

176
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,150
So what do the concordant pairs contribute
to the Mantel-Haenszel statistic?

177
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,940
Let's look at that.

178
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,640
So here's an example of concordant pair,
where both the case and

179
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,960
the control have diabetes.

180
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,150
If I go to calculate out the expected
value here,

181
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,700
the expected value is one, because the row
total is two, the column total is one.

182
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,270
Two times one, divided by two, there's two
total in the stratum.

183
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,550
Two divided by two gives you one.

184
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,150
We're expecting one case to have diabetes.

185
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,250
And indeed we observed one case having
diabetes.

186
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,850
So observed minus expected here equals
zero.

187
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,170
So again you can see that we are going to
get some zeros.

188
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,940
The concorded pairs are not going to
contribute to

189
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,900
the Mantel-Haenszel statistic.

190
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,230
The same with the variance.

191
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,530
Remember the variance is row one times
column one.

192
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,110
Times row 2 times column 2.

193
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,750
Since row 2 is equal to 0, were
multiplying in the 0,

194
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,640
that is going to come out to 0 as well, so
its not going to contribute.

195
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,270
Same way if you look at the concordant
pairs were both the case and

196
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,220
the control are free of diabetes we are
going to get all 0's for those numbers.

197
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,260
So when we add those into the
Mantel-Haenszel statistic,

198
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,660
they're going to contribute zero.

199
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,350
As they should, because they don't give us
any information about

200
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,320
the relationship between diabetes and
heart attack.

201
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,041
How about the discordant pair?

202
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,150
So where we have discordants we can either
have the case having diabetes so

203
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,890
that case is shown here.

204
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,860
When the case has diabetes and the control
does not, then when we do the expected

205
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,340
value, it's going to be row one times
column one so one times one divided by

206
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,020
the total in the stratum, which is two so
one times one divided by two is a half.

207
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,420
And, we're expecting to see about a half
of a case having diabetes.

208
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,410
In fact, we saw one case with diabetes, so
one minus the expected value of a half,

209
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,120
gives us a value of positive one half
here, for

210
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,150
that difference between the observed and
the expected.

211
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,040
The variance is going to turn out to be
one over four, 'cause every row and

212
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,530
every column here has a total of one.

213
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,450
And then, the total is two, so we're
going to do, put in the denominator,

214
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:22,220
two squared, times two minus one, which
is, to which is 2 times 2, or 4.

215
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,190
So we end up with that the variance,

216
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,570
every stratum, contributes one fourth to
the variance.

217
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,350
That's what's going to go in

218
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,620
the denominator of the Mantel-Haenszel
statistic.

219
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,240
If we look at the situation where we have
discordance in the other wave,

220
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,630
the control has diabetes and the case does
not.

221
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,060
The expected value, again, is going to be
a half.

222
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,570
But the observed minus the expected, now,
since we're focusing on cell A,

223
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,430
is going to B zero minus a half, or
negative one half.

224
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,590
So we're going to end up with a negative
in this case.

225
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,260
The variance is going to be exactly the
same as before, one quarter.

226
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,920
So now we can take all of those values,
and

227
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,830
plug into the Mantel–Haenszel statistic.

228
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,650
So again, here is the Mantel–Haenszel
statistic.

229
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,700
I'm now going to just kind of go through
how to calculate all this.

230
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,920
So, we've got a chi square with one degree
of freedom.

231
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,130
That is equal to, so what do we do?

232
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:12,930
Let's start with the numerator.

233
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,790
What do we do in the numerator?

234
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,070
We're going to add up the summations, that
means we're adding.

235
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,848
There's 144 strata.

236
00:12:17,848 --> 00:12:20,880
We're going to add up all the observed,

237
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,940
minus expecteds, from each of the 144
strata.

238
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,310
We're going to do that.

239
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,160
First.

240
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,540
Well, what was the observed minus expected
for the concord in strata?

241
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,150
Those were all 0s.

242
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,680
We're going to get a whole bunch of 0s,
they won't contribute in, to anything.

243
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,260
Then, we're going to get, there were 37
discordant pairs, discordant strata,

244
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,350
where the observed minus the expected was
equal to positive one half.

245
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:49,790
There were 16 where the observe minus the
expected was equal to negative one half.

246
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,570
So that sum will be the total sum that
goes in the numerator.

247
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,350
And then after all of that we're going to
square it.

248
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,540
That's the, the squared part happens last.

249
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,060
That's the numerator of the
Mantel-Haenszel statistic here.

250
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,710
In the denominator we're again going to be
summary,

251
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,880
summing up over 144 pairs, 144 strata.

252
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,770
The variances.

253
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:13,650
But remember that the variances from those
concordant strata were again, all zero.

254
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,350
So they contribute zero.

255
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,130
Everywhere that there was a discordant
strata,

256
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,460
they, each of those strata contributed one
fourth.

257
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,060
So both, the discordant cells in both
directions.

258
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,630
So 37 plus 16.

259
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,240
A total of 53 contributed a fourth.

260
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,820
Now, what you'll notice is if you multiply
this out,

261
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,910
we can simplify this is a little bit.

262
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,290
It turns out to be,

263
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,450
you can say that we have in the numerator
1 half times 37 minus 16.

264
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,160
I just pulled out the half there.

265
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,330
With that is squared.

266
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,520
And that's going to be divided by a total
of 53 time a quarter.

267
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,710
But notice that if I pull the square over
here and

268
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,400
I square the half, and take that out.

269
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,390
Half squared is just a fourth, so those
two are going to cancel.

270
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,350
What do I end up with?

271
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,610
I end up with 37 minus 16 squared, divided
by 53.

272
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,270
Well guess what?

273
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,140
That is also the Macnemare statistic.

274
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,480
So we got, when we apply the
Mantel-Haenszel formula here,

275
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,940
we ended up with a, with the Macnemare's
chi square as well.

276
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:21,110
It's the exact same mathematical formula,
b minus c square, divided by b plus c.

277
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,090
So these turn out to be identical.

278
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,620
I've shown this here with specific
numbers, and now,

279
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,820
let's also show it more generally, using b
plus c rather than specific numbers.

280
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,540
For those of you who want a neat slide
where this is all written out,

281
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,390
I'm putting that, I'm placing that here
just in case you want to see it

282
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,930
written out more neatly than my
handwritting.

283
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,680
But now going to generalizing.

284
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,920
Let's generalize this whole thing.

285
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,945
So, now if we look at the Cochran
Mantel-Haenszel statistic and

286
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:48,610
we think about the general case.

287
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,010
Anywhere we have the situation of paired
data where we have discorded and

288
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,300
concorded pairs.

289
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,410
Notice what's going to happen when we plug
into the Mantel-Haenszel statistic.

290
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,540
Which again is a chi squared with one
degree of freedom.

291
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,990
We are going to be in the numerator we are
going to be adding zero for

292
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,820
all the concorded cells.

293
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,240
And then we are going to be adding
one-half, positive one-half for

294
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,200
all the B cells.

295
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:21,750
Remember the B situation is where it's the
case that has the diabetes

296
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,160
and the, control that doesn't or the case
that has the exposure and

297
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,910
the control that doesn't, if we're
generalizing.

298
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,766
For all the C cells, it's going to be
negative one half, and

299
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:33,210
then we're going to be squaring that.

300
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:37,750
In the denominator, the variances are only
occur where we have discordant cells and

301
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,960
that's going to be the b plus c and we're
going to,

302
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,730
each one of those contributes one fourth
to the variance.

303
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,400
So we can write this down generally.

304
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,550
We can show that is always the case that
the Mantel-Haenszel statistic when

305
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:52,080
applied to this particular situation will
simplify, again, these halves.

306
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,400
Halve squared will come out and it'll
cancel the one fourth

307
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,710
will simplify to B minus C square, divided
by B plus C.

308
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,370
Which is exactly the same as the
Mcnamara's statistics.

309
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,380
So mathematically, these things turn out
to be equivalent,

310
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,580
which is just pretty cool.

311
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,570
And again, I'm writing that out.

312
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,890
Is putting that in a neat slide for

313
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,070
any of you who need a little bit neater
handwriting there.
