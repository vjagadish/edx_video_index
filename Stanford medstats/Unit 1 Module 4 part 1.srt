1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:09,400
In this next module,

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,420
I'm going to talk about the statistics
that are used to describe where's

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,520
the center of your data?

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,260
So the main measures that we use for
central tendency,

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,514
that is where's the center of your data,
are the mean and the median.

6
00:00:20,514 --> 00:00:24,220
Probably most of you are very familiar
with the mean.

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,230
So, a mean is just an average and

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,770
you've probably all calculated the
averages throughout your life.

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,430
So, this is not something that's very
hard, but I'm going to,

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,910
want you to think a little bit about the
mean in a different way.

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,885
I want you to also think about the mean as
a balancing point.

12
00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:40,380
I'm going to show you that in a minute.

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,250
I also want to show you the mathematical
shorthand,

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,860
the mathematical symbols that we use to
represent the calculation of a mean.

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,930
I'll be using some of these symbols in
this class, so

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,250
it's helpful for you to be comfortable
with these.

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,980
So how do we calculate a mean?

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,780
It's very easy.

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,710
We add up all of the values and we divide
by the sample size.

20
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,190
Again, probably many of you have
calculated many of these in your life.

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,300
But how's that look in math shorthand?

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,130
So in math shorthand,

23
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,860
the way that I'm going to represent a mean
is I'm going to write X bar.

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,120
And that's important to remember because
I'll be using the X bar a lot,

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,015
just to save myself the time of having to
write out the word mean.

26
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:19,770
So there's a little bit of math shorthand
that I will be using in this class.

27
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,520
So x bar represents the sample mean.

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,000
When I take some data and I calculate an
average or

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,470
a mean, that I will represent as an X bar.

30
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,260
The way we calculate X bar, the mean is to
add up all of the observations and

31
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,150
divide by n, and that's represented by
these symbols here.

32
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,390
So here's my summation sign.

33
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,570
So what this summation sign is saying is
add up all of

34
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,820
the observations from 1 to n, because
again, I have n observations in my sample.

35
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,180
I'm representing each observation as Xi,

36
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,490
so that X1 would be the first observation,
X2 is the second, etcetera.

37
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,720
And this just says add up all of those
observations.

38
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,290
And then we divide by n, the total number
of observations, and

39
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,900
this is a longer, over here, is a longer
way to write that.

40
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,200
If these symbols are a little unfamiliar
to you,

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,060
like if you haven't seen a summation sign
before, you should take the math

42
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,775
tutorial that's offered before you take
the rest of this course.

43
00:02:12,775 --> 00:02:15,259
because I will be throwing up some
summation signs every now and then.

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,870
So let me just give a quick example of how
to calculate a mean,

45
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,310
this should be easy for all of you.

46
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,350
So for example, let's say I had some
hypothetical data here,

47
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,370
I have some data on eight participants in
a study and I have their data, their ages.

48
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,860
So it ranged from 17 to 38.

49
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,920
If I wanted to figure out their average
age,

50
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,370
I would just add up those eight values and
divide by 8.

51
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,510
When I do that, I come out with a value of
23.25.

52
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,770
So again, I think that should be pretty
easy and familiar to most of you.

53
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,410
Now I'm going to show you some of the
example data on my Stanford students.

54
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,560
So for example, I asked them to report how
many hours a week they spent on homework.

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,720
And you can see the distribution of
homework the homework variable here in

56
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,450
a histogram.

57
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,270
Well, it turns out that the mean for

58
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,620
homework in my student sample was 11.4
hours per week.

59
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,200
So on average, students were doing about
11 hours of homework.

60
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,550
Now, as I mentioned, you can think of the
mean as a balancing point.

61
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,880
So imagine, this kind of harkens back to
high school physics a bit.

62
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,070
Imagine that that this graphic that you're
seeing here,

63
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,380
this histogram, is actually a lever.

64
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,580
And each of these little red bars
represents a mass.

65
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,670
So the, the smallest red bar is a small
bass, the mass,

66
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,350
the biggest red bar is a big mass.

67
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,180
So we just picture this as being sort of a
lever wth masses on it.

68
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,940
And here is the balancing part, here is
the fulcrum.

69
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:51,720
And the goal here is to balance this like
a see saw.

70
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,360
To balance it so it's perfectly balanced.

71
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,630
The mean is the point at which, you, if
you put the,

72
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,150
where you put the fulcrum that you will
balance these masses.

73
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,040
And if you remember back to Basic Physics,

74
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,860
if you've ever done anything with levers
and fulcrums.

75
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,580
You'll remember there was a principle that
said the further away a mass is from

76
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,520
the fulcrum, the more force it exerts,
right?

77
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,600
So there was a formula that said that
force was equal to mass times distance, so

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,890
the mass matters, but also how far away
from the center you are matters.

79
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,745
And so, there, the same principles applies
with means.

80
00:04:28,745 --> 00:04:31,080
The farther something is away from the
mean,

81
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,420
the more influence, the more pull it has
on the mean.

82
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,570
So let me illustrate that now.

83
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:43,170
So take for example the variable alcoholic
drinks.

84
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,330
So, here's the histogram for alcoholic
drinks.

85
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,540
I asked students to report how many drinks
they had in drinks per week.

86
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,840
And, I'm showing you the histogram here.

87
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,570
For my student sample, the mean was 2.3
drinks per week.

88
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,120
Pretty low.

89
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,180
And again, you can think of that as the
balancing point.

90
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,470
So, I'm going to have to put the fulcrum
at 2.3 in order to

91
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,072
balance this lever that has masses stacked
on it.

92
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:13,300
And, if you were to take the very highest
value and

93
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,330
change that and make it higher, that will
have a big effect on the balancing point.

94
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,700
So again, the further you are from the
balancing the more force you're having.

95
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,570
So for example, what if I were to take the
person who drank the most,

96
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,350
which was only eight drinks per week.

97
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,860
And I were, was to make that a much higher
value, like pretend that,

98
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,540
that person were actually was an
alcoholic.

99
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,830
So imagine that, that, the highest value
was no longer eight drinks per week, but

100
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,860
it was all the way up like at 40 drinks
per week.

101
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,310
So I had an alcoholic in, in the data set.

102
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,050
If I were to pull that one value which has
very little mass.

103
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,860
Remember, it's only 1 out of 50 people.

104
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,960
So it's a very small mass.

105
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,465
If I were to pull that one value, really
far from the mean.

106
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:56,340
In order to balance this lever now, so
again,

107
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,260
imagine that this is just like a long
board her.

108
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,610
You've got masses on it.

109
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,220
In order to balance this, this is having a
lot of force now because it's so far.

110
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,300
So to balance this, I'm actually going to
have to pull the fulcrum quite a bit

111
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,010
to the right in order to balance this
lever now.

112
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,560
So that one little mass, is a very tiny
amount of mass because it's so

113
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,915
far from the mean.

114
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:22,350
It has a huge influence on the mean.

115
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:27,086
So the mean, if I plot my new data in
histogram where the highest value is 40

116
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:32,968
rather than 8, that pulls the mean all the
way from 2.3 drinks per week up to 2.9,

117
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:34,780
almost 3 drinks per week.

118
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,780
So, one person going up to 40 has a huge
influence on the mean.

119
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,478
This is only one person out of 50, but
it's having a big influence on the mean.

120
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:50,170
Now, I want to take a moment here and tell
you a little bit about,

121
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,400
I mentioned binary variables in an earlier
module this week.

122
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,760
Binary variables have only two categories
to them.

123
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,730
It might seem odd to, to, for me to tell
you that a binary variable can

124
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,770
have a mean, but in fact, a binary
variable can have a mean.

125
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,460
If you code that binary variable as a 0/1
variable.

126
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,330
And it turns out to be useful for a lot of
situations in statistics to think about

127
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,130
binary variables as a series of 0s and 1s
and to kind of think of them numerically.

128
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,560
So that you can treat them numerically,
you can calculate things like averages.

129
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,770
So for example, if you take, in my example
data set,

130
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,630
I asked the students whether or not they
played varsity sports in high school,

131
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,010
that's a binary variable, a yes/no
variable.

132
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,190
If I code that in my data set rather than
coding it as no and yes, if I code that

133
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,660
as 0 for no and 1 for yes, and I actually
think about those 0s and 1s as numbers.

134
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,426
I can in fact calculate an average for
this binary variable.

135
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:53,398
So again, here is the histogram for,
played varsity sports in high school.

136
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:58,470
30 or 60% of my sample had played varsity
sports, 40% had not.

137
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,294
What if you thought of that as a series of
0s and

138
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,430
1s, how would you calculate the average?

139
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,010
So let's do that.

140
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,300
How would I calculate the average here?

141
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,802
Well, I've got 20 people who have a value
of 0, 30 people who have a value of 1.

142
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:15,976
So I'm just literally going to add up
those 30 1s and

143
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:19,020
those 20 0s, which just gives me a value
of 30, and

144
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,564
I'm going to divide by the total number,
which in this case is 50.

145
00:08:21,564 --> 00:08:25,110
So 30 divided by 50 gives me a value of
0.6.

146
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,020
So notice that the average here is just
the percentage of people who answered yes,

147
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,330
the percentage of those who played varsity
sports in high school.

148
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:38,442
But you can calculate an average, it comes
out to be 60%, 0.6 in this case.

149
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:42,390
The other way that we tend to

150
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,370
measure central tendency other than the
mean is something called the median.

151
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,750
The median is the exact middle value.

152
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,640
So that means if you were to rank
everybody from the lowest value to

153
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,480
the highest value on whatever variable
you're considering, it would be the,

154
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,025
the value that fell right smack in the
middle.

155
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:04,270
Now, if there are an odd number of
observations, like if

156
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:09,020
there was 101 observations, then there
will be one value right in the middle.

157
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,970
But actually, if you have an even number
of observations then

158
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,190
there's going to be two values that are
smack in the middle.

159
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,670
So what we do in that case is we take
those two values and we just average them.

160
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,180
We add them up and divide by 2.

161
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,170
So let me give you an example of how we
calculate the median.

162
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:29,560
So, from this hypothetical data set on
ages of participants to,

163
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,990
in order to calculate the median,

164
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,540
I have to line up the ages from the lowest
17 to the highest 38 which I've done here.

165
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,300
And then, I have an even number of
observations, so

166
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,930
I'm going to have two middle values.

167
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,972
So I'm going to take those two middle
values, 22 and 23, and

168
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:45,150
I'm going to average them.

169
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,910
Just add them up and divide by 2.

170
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,740
So my median occurs at 22.5.

171
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:56,142
That means, half of my observations are
below 22.5 and half are above 22.5.

172
00:09:56,142 --> 00:10:00,160
So if 22.5 is here, four observations are
below, four are above.

173
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,970
Half are below, half are above.

174
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:02,700
That's the median.

175
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,020
So, for example, what if I asked what's
the median of homework?

176
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,804
So it turns out that the median of
homework in my data set was

177
00:10:10,804 --> 00:10:12,430
10 hours per week.

178
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,320
So that means that half of my students
were doing less than 10 hours per week,

179
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,700
and half of my students were doing more
than 10 hours per week.

180
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,330
If you think of this again as masses,
those bars as masses,

181
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:29,002
that means 50% of the mass is below 10 and
50% of the mass is above 10.

182
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:33,670
For alcohol drinking, the median turned
out to be 2.0 drinks per week.

183
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,700
So, half of my students had less than two
drinks per week,

184
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,320
half had more than two drinks per week.

185
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,640
And, unlike the mean, the median is not
affected by extreme values.

186
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,620
So, because we're just talking about where
50% are above and

187
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,350
below, it doesn't matter if there are
extreme values in there.

188
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,600
It doesn't matter if in the top 50%,
somebody has a really high level of

189
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,980
drinking or whether the high, the highest
value of drinking isn't so high.

190
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,920
So for example,

191
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,100
if I took the highest drinking person,
which was only eight drinks per week.

192
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,470
And again, I made them an alcoholic.

193
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,270
I said that that value, the highest
drinker actually had 40 drinks per week.

194
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,080
How does that effect the median?

195
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,710
Well, it doesn't effect the median, right,

196
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:22,730
because 50% of people are still below two
and 50% of people are still above two.

197
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,250
It doesn't matter that the highest person
is, it doesn't matter whether they're at

198
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,550
eight or whether they're at 40, that
doesn't effect where the median lies.

199
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,532
So the median is not effected by extreme
values.

200
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:40,900
Now I asked whether or not varsity sports
has a mean, we can, that's

201
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,620
a binary variable does varsity sports, a
binary variable also have a median.

202
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,340
Sure.
Again,

203
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,462
if you think about a binary variable as a
series of 0s and

204
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:53,920
1s, then you just line up the 0s and 1s
from the lowest, the 0s,

205
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,590
to the highest, the 1s, and you find where
the middle number, number lies.

206
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,760
Well, in this case there are more 1s than
there are 0s, because more people had

207
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,960
played varsity sports than hadn't, so the
middle number, the median will occur at 1.

208
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,110
So, yes, it has a median.

209
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,051
It has a median of 1.
