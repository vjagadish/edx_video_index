1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,834
In this next module, I'm going to tell you
how to test the linearity assumption for

2
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:11,020
continuous predictors in Cox regression.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,220
When we talk about logistic regression, we
spend an awful lot of time talking

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,590
about testing, whether or not continuous
predictors were linear in the low jet.

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,480
And this is exactly analogous to that.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,040
We're going to have a linearity assumption
in the log hazard that we have to test for

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,079
continuous predictors.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,400
Why is that?

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,990
Remember, what is our model here?

10
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,820
We're modeling the log of the hazard rate
is equal to the log of

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,050
some baseline hazard rate, which we're not
bothering to estimate.

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,080
Plus, betas and predictors.

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,700
Some combination of betas and predictors.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,880
We are assuming a linear relationship
between x and the log hazard,

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,010
just by modeling it this way.

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,260
So, for example, if I was to put age in my
model and I fit a beta for age,

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:08,420
I am then assuming that age actually has a
linear relationship with the log hazard.

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,530
I've modeled age as a linear term in the
model here.

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,290
If I find that age doesn't have a linear
relationship,

20
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,080
I might need to do a quadratic term for
age or something like that.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,900
We need to somehow be able to determine
whether or

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,120
not age has a linear relationship with the
log hazard.

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,711
Of course, if you've got categorical
predictors or binary predictors,

24
00:01:29,711 --> 00:01:33,302
you're not going to have to worry about
this because binary predictors and

25
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:37,007
dummy-coded categorical predictors always
hit a straight line because two

26
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:38,900
points always make a line.

27
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,560
This is only for continuous predictors.

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,880
We can't directly plot the log hazard
against age, however.

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,842
So we're going to have to get at it with
some other types of plots.

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,770
So just to give sa,some data, example data
to work with here.

31
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,140
I've got some data from early in the AIDS
epidemic.

32
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,620
A 100 people, the outcome was time to
death.

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,840
The continuous predictor here is age.

34
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,260
There was also a binary predictor we
talked about in an earlier module,

35
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,340
IV drug use.

36
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,760
But of course, we don't have to test
linearity for IV drug use.

37
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,600
Only for age here.

38
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,270
So, one of the ways to test linearity in

39
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,120
the log hazard is to do a Martingale
residual plot.

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,050
So, you can take your continuous predictor
and

41
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,500
you plot it against the Martingale
residuals, but you want to plot it

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,380
against the Martingale residuals from a
model that actually doesn't include age.

43
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,620
That includes any other predictors that
you're going to include in

44
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,170
your final model, but excludes the
predictor that you're testing.

45
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,920
That's probably the preferred way to do
this.

46
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,760
So you plot age against these residuals
which your computer easily calculates for

47
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,850
you and will spit out for you.

48
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,030
I'm going to put on superimposed some kind
of smoothing line here to

49
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,730
see what's the functional form here.

50
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,190
And for age here, it looks pretty good.

51
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,910
It's not a perfectly straight line.

52
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,670
It's just teeny bit of curvy curviness to
this line.

53
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,620
But it's pretty close as real data go.

54
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,350
It would probably be just fine to model
age here as a linear term in the model.

55
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:08,440
By leaving out age out of the model, we
also can see that the risk,

56
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,090
the rate of death goes up here with age.

57
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,310
That tells us something about the
relationship between age and our outcome.

58
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,730
So that's the Martingale residual plot,
it's super easy to do and you're looking

59
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,470
for, to see whether or not there were
actually is a straight line relationship.

60
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,270
A second option that you have for

61
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,080
testing the, the linearity assumption is
to do some kind of a dummy plot.

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,620
And so what this is, is you're going to
take your continuous predictor and

63
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,460
split it into even-sized categories.

64
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,310
So like, quartiles, or quintiles, or

65
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,740
deciles, depending on how big your sample
is.

66
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,780
You're going to calculate the mean value
of your continuous predictor for

67
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,156
each one of those categories, you're
going to need those later for graphing.

68
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:47,240
Then you take the, that new categorical
predictor,

69
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,530
those categories, you enter them into a
Cox regression.

70
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,950
Cox regression dummy code it.

71
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,650
So a binary indicator variable for each
category.

72
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,890
You then are going to plot the betas that
result from those,

73
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,300
from that Cox regression model,

74
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,840
plot those betas against the mean value of
your continuous predictor for each bin.

75
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,270
This should roughly be a straight line.

76
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,500
If that's a straight line,

77
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,720
that would indicate that you've met the
linearity assumption.

78
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,750
If it's not a straight line, it tells you
that you may have to

79
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,870
model a continuous predictor as something
other than linear.

80
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,840
And so I went ahead and

81
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,370
did that with the data for age from this
sample of a 100 people.

82
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,460
So what I did here was I divided age up
into six categories.

83
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,800
You know I could have done ten here,

84
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,500
I could have done eight, I could have done
five.

85
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,930
I, I just choose, I just chose six
arbitrarily for illustration purposes.

86
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,000
So I took my, my 100 observations and

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,820
divided up, them up into roughly even
categories of six.

88
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,890
Of course, they're not going to be exactly
even, and for

89
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,230
each of those categories I calculated the
mean age for the category.

90
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,578
So for example, the youngest category for

91
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:56,695
age at a mean age of around, somewhere
around 28.

92
00:04:56,695 --> 00:05:03,060
The second category for age had a mean age
rate around about 31 or 32, and so on.

93
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:10,570
I then set up a Cox regression model,

94
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,380
which contained in it a beta for age
group.

95
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,920
I set age group one as the reference group
here.

96
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,290
So, a beta for age group two, a beta for
age group three.

97
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,880
And these are, again, dummy coded
variables.

98
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,530
Beta for age group four, beta for age
group five and a beta for age group six.

99
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,270
In my model I can also include any other
ah,predictors that I

100
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,320
might be adjusting for in that model.

101
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,170
I then took those betas and plotted them
against the mean age for each category.

102
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,400
And that's all I've done here.

103
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,370
You can actually do this one by hand.

104
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,550
And it looks pretty good.

105
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,350
It looks like a reasonably straight line
fit here.

106
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,350
So again, it looks like age,

107
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,180
it's reasonable to model age as a linear
predictor in this model.

108
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,520
So for any continuous predictors,

109
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,750
you're going to want to check the
linearity assumption.

110
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,880
