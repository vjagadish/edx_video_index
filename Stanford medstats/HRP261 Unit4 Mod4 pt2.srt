1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,210
What's interesting about this particular
example,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,320
one of the reasons I like to actually use
this example, is that

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,730
the authors made a point of illustrating
something called residual confounding.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,710
And it's very important as we start
talking about statistical adjustment for

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,570
confounding, it's really important to keep
in the back of

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,070
your mind That adjustment for confounding
is not a panacea.

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:28,470
You cannot adjust away all confounding and
that is kind of well illustrated here.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,360
So, this first regression analysis was
actually included in

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,870
the paper just as an illustration of
residual confounding.

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,990
What they did,

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,340
in that very first regression analysis is
they model age crudely.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:46,130
They put into their regression as a
predictor you're either younger than 35 or

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,110
you're 35 and older.

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,250
So they model age as a binary predictor.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,100
When they do that, we are indeed
attenuating the odds ratio.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,690
It's going from 0.8 to 0.87, but we are
not completely wiping out the effect

17
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,590
of confounding by maternal age and that's
illustrated as well by the second

18
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:11,040
regression analysis because this also
includes age as a binary predictor.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,060
But it also adjusts for

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,015
all the other things we're eventually
going to adjust for, race and parity.

21
00:01:15,015 --> 00:01:19,330
What this shows you is that just putting
age in

22
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:24,280
as a binary predictior does not take away
all of the confounding.

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,250
When and the last model, the authors
finally put in

24
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,910
the exact year of maternal age, then, all
of the confounding is removed.

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,610
But this is illustrating the point that
when you put in predictors that

26
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,490
are imprecisely measured.

27
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,928
Which is, often times we're not measuring
things precisely,

28
00:01:43,928 --> 00:01:48,120
then there were going to be some leftover
confounding.

29
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,400
Finally, at the end here, they were
actually,

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,050
I mean age is one of the things you are
able to measure precisely.

31
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,840
You can get birth dates.

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,690
So once they finally put in age as a exact
birth date,

33
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:03,070
the exact age, then finally they were able
to adjust away for all confounding.

34
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,390
But for most predictors, for

35
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,340
most confounders, we don't measure them
precisely.

36
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,060
And we don't measure the predictors
precisely and

37
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,780
the outcomes precisely in a lot of cases.

38
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,930
So the problem here is that, because
there's error in the various measurements,

39
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,680
statistical adjustment is imperfect, and
that's what we call residual confounding.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,310
And it comes up a lot.

41
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,100
You really cannot completely wipe out
confounding, simply by adjusting for

42
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,630
variables in multiple regression.

43
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,380
Unless you had somehow measured the
variables completely with zero error.

44
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,750
We did it probably in the last example.

45
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,890
Down's syndrome is pretty easy to measure,
to get,

46
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,550
I mean that's it's a very easy one to
measure.

47
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,840
We could probably get a good gauge of
that.

48
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,200
Smoking is relatively easy to measure
although, you know,

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,576
there might be some confounding, some
leftover confounding with smoking.

50
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:53,580
Because it's, we're not going to measure
that, totally precisely.

51
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,380
But age is going to be measured precisely.

52
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,250
So we were able to wipe out most of the
confounding in that example but I'll

53
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,440
just tell you that, residual confounding
comes up a lot with observational studies.

54
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,240
You say oh, I've adjusted for smoking.

55
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,600
I've adjusted for age.

56
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,930
Therefore I've taken care of those.

57
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,630
They're all done with.

58
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,270
They can't be any confounding by those.

59
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,680
But in fact, that's not true.

60
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,900
If you measured your confounders at all
imperfectly, or

61
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,240
if you measured your predictors, your
outcome at all imperfectly,

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,430
it's impossible to completely adjust away
all the confounding.

63
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,400
In most cases you end up with some
leftover or residual confounding.

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,112
And my favorite example to illustrate that
is, an example that

65
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:36,880
was in the American archive, the Archives
of Internal Medicine a few years back.

66
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,850
Made a lot of headlines in the news media.

67
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,800
I've shown this table before, I just love
this table as an illustration of why

68
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,980
confounding occurs, and why we have to
worry about confounding.

69
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,765
This was a study that was looking at, I'm
just showing you the men here,

70
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:55,080
was looking at red meat eating and whether
or not it related to mortality.

71
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,440
And they classified men into different
quintiles of red meat eating,

72
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,030
Q5 being the highest red meat eater.

73
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,440
And I've shown this before, but if you
look carefully at this table, all the,

74
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,640
the risk factors for for, you know, all
the bad health behaviors and

75
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,510
risk factors go up as you go up across the
different quintiles.

76
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,020
So, you go up, your BMI increases.

77
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,310
As you eat more red meat, you, you're more
likely to be a current smoker.

78
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,760
You're less likely to exercise, you're
more likely to eat a lot of calories.

79
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,890
So basically, people who eat a lot of,

80
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:30,230
especially men here, who eat a lot of red
meat, tend to be risky in many ways.

81
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,700
They have, they just have bad health
habits.

82
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,870
Maybe they're more risk-takers in general.

83
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,950
So this paper was attempting to say,

84
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:44,990
what is the precise effect of actually
eating red meat with mortality.

85
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,180
And so they said we're going to try to
adjust away for all these [UNKNOWN].

86
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,480
We're going to throw BMI in the model.

87
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,950
We're going to throw smoking in the model.

88
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,260
We're going to throw exercise in the
model.

89
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,380
We're going to try to adjust away for all
those things.

90
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,230
So I'm going to show the, the results of
this from this study.

91
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:03,540
So this is showing you the mortality
risks.

92
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,810
These are relative risks.

93
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,930
Something called hazard ratios.

94
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,190
This actually came out of Cox regression
and not logistic regression but

95
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,780
Residual compounding applies to all types
of regression.

96
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,890
So what you're seeing here is that for,
let's start with overall mortality.

97
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,740
And actually, let me zoom in a little bit
here so

98
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,230
that it's easier on the small screens to
see this.

99
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,390
So we're going to start with all cause
mortality.

100
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,980
The reference group is the lowest red meat
eaters.

101
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,000
The Q5 is the highest red meat eaters.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,660
And they're show you the risks, the
relative risks, this is called a hazard

103
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,100
ratio, but just like a risk ratio, as you
go up across the different quintile.

104
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,570
So the basic model into adjusted for too
many things and

105
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,150
indeed, you're seeing a nice increase in
mortality as you eating more, red meat.

106
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,170
Then they do an adjusted model.

107
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:45,910
They're trying to adjust for

108
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,520
all these things that are all different
about heavy red meat eaters.

109
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:52,240
And what you'll notice is that as we
adjust,

110
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,090
with especially in that last Q5 quintile.

111
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,030
That when you adjust, you started at 1.48,
when you adjust for

112
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,730
all these things, indeed, indeed the,
effect gets attenuated.

113
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,200
It gets closer to one.

114
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,040
So it, it's really, after you adjust for

115
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,160
everything, a 31% increase in your
mortality risk or rate.

116
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,340
And then, but what's interesting here is
you might've just stopped there and

117
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,600
said, okay wow, we adjusted for BMI, we
adjusted for exercise.

118
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,470
You know, the, the others did a great job
adjusting for

119
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,120
everything they possibly could.

120
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,410
This was a nicely done study.

121
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,980
And you might just stop there and say,.

122
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,130
I've adjusted for everything, and it's
still, an elevated risk.

123
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,670
It's still statistically signifigant.

124
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,390
Aha.

125
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,710
Red meat eating is bad for you.

126
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,910
And that's, indeed, what the conclusion of
this study was.

127
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,100
It was widely reported in the media.

128
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,510
What's, interesting, though, is if you
delve in to the specific causes of death.

129
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,130
If you look at cancer mortality.

130
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,970
Okay, cancer mortality elevated,

131
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,830
also elevated in that heavy red meat
eating group.

132
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,320
And again adjusting for the confounding
does tend to make that effect somewhat but

133
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,124
it still remains after adjustment.

134
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:55,735
1.22 for cancer mortality.

135
00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:59,760
1.27 for cardiovascular disease mortality,
but

136
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,930
here is where it really gets interesting.

137
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,240
So they also put in there mortality from
injuries and sudden death.

138
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,620
They also looked at that, that's a
category of,

139
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,310
of things that people might die from.

140
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,610
So this includes things like gunshot
wounds and car accidents.

141
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,490
Those would probably be the most common.

142
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:22,220
So whats interesting here [LAUGH] is that
if you look at the risk ratio,

143
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,900
the relative risk here between high red
meat eating compared to

144
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,250
the reference group of low red meat eaters
It's also elevated.

145
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,560
It's this, and the magnitude is almost
identical to the increase in risk for

146
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,200
cardiovascular disease and for cancer.

147
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,810
So that's really interesting, because if
you start to make up a causal story here,

148
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,600
how does red meat eating, heavy red meat
eating.

149
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,540
How does that increase your risk of car
accidents and gun shot wounds?

150
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,840
Well, the, the logical answer to that is
it probably doesn't.

151
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,600
So what we're seeing here,

152
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,690
this 1.26 is almost certainly the result
of residual confounding.

153
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,830
Heavy red meat eaters tend to be people
who have a lot of risky behaviors.

154
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,010
They probably take a lot of chances.

155
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,560
They might own guns and, you know, drive
too fast.

156
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,210
Might drink while driving and

157
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,860
the kinds of things that increase your
things of this type of death.

158
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,960
And notice that when we adjust for
confounding here, there's no change.

159
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,050
So you had 1.24 before adjustment for all
the confounders.

160
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,610
And 1.26 after you adjust.

161
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,400
That's telling you that there's just
something inherently risky about red meat

162
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,740
eaters that we are unable to capture with
the confounders that we've measured here.

163
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,340
And that leads me to believe that the the
relationships detected

164
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,350
here between cancer mortality and

165
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:45,270
cardiovascular mortality which are about
the same magnitude, 1.27 and 1.22.

166
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:50,240
that that, those also might be due to
residual confounding.

167
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,270
Heavy red meat eaters just do a lot of
things bad and

168
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,580
that increases their risk of mortality,
but it might not be that

169
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,510
it's because red meat eating per se has a
direct effect on mortality.

170
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:06,540
All other deaths also, which is sort of a
catch-all category, also is elevated in

171
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,350
a way that makes you suspicious that there
might be residual confounding.

172
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,850
Some people actually wrote letters to the
editor on this particular one

173
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,430
worried about the issue of residual
confounding.

174
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,690
And just to help you recognize when there
might be

175
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,100
residual confounding if you're talking
about a binary predictor, like you know,

176
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,220
you're a high red meat eater or you're
not.

177
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,880
Incomplete adjustment for

178
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,430
confounding can generate spurious relative
risks in the range of 0.6 to 1.6.

179
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,330
So notice the, the relative risk we were
talking about with

180
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,010
the red meat eating example was about 1.2,
1.3, in that range.

181
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,680
So these are small effect sizes.

182
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,440
For the down syndrome example.

183
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,080
The, the effect size was 0.8.

184
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,465
So, those were both within the range of
0.6 to 1.6.

185
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:57,730
So people, statisticians have done
simulations where they actually

186
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:03,020
show that residual confounding can cause
spurious associations in that

187
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,546
general relative risk range, 0.6 to 1.6.

188
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:12,260
In other words, if you see an effect size
of two or three in your data set,

189
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,250
that is usually beyond what residual
confounding can cause.

190
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,208
So residual confounding is kind of limited
in its scope, but

191
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:23,920
if you pick up a lot of observational
studies, and papers, and the literature.

192
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,980
You will see plenty of risk ratios and
odds ratios that are 1.3, 0.8, 1.2, 4.

193
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:34,690
These are the, the, when the effect sizes
are these,

194
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:38,030
this small, this is where you start to
worry that there might be residual

195
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,520
confounding that can completely explain
the association that you're seeing.

196
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,590
I've given you examples here where the
residual, failure to,

197
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:51,510
to completely perfectly adjust for
confounding, creates spirious association.

198
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,530
however, it can also go in the other
direction.

199
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,545
Residual confounding might also obscure
relationships.

200
00:10:56,545 --> 00:11:01,150
It's causing you to miss associations so
you might end up with a risk ratio of one,

201
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,170
when the true risk rate is 0.8 because of
residual confounding.

202
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,040
Those examples are much more harder to,
find.

203
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,036
They're much harder to uncover.

204
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:11,850
But they can happen So just keep in mind
that it can go either way.
