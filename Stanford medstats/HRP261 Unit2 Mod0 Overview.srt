00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,510
Welcome to week 2 of HRP 261.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,080
Last week we talked about some basic
tests,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,410
that you can use to analyze data from
contingency tables.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,720
So that was a situation where we just
wanted to see whether or

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,080
not a categorical predictor and a
categorical outcome were associated,

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,480
not taking into account any things like
confounders or any other variables.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,770
This week we're going to complicate the
picture just slightly by adding a third

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,870
variable to the picture.

10
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,800
So this week I'm going to be talking about
three concepts that are important for

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,630
you to understand before we move on to
regression analysis.

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,420
Some of you may already be familiar with
these concepts, but

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,700
they are confounding, interaction, and
mediation.

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,536
And for the first few modules this week,

15
00:00:46,536 --> 00:00:50,640
I am just basically going to go over
conceptually, what those things look like.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,080
Now I'm going to tell you a little bit
about,

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,140
what it called the Mantel-Haenszel tests.

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,160
These tests can be used to evaluate
confounding.

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,640
In a very simple situation, when we have a
single categorical confounder.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,300
So again, we're sort of adding a third
variable to the picture we

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,930
talked about last week.

22
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,950
Last week we talked about trying to see
whether or

23
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,490
not a predictor in an outcome variable
were statistically linked.

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,790
We looked at a bunch of tests that you
could use to evaluate that.

25
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,810
This week again, we're going to add a
third variable to that picture,

26
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,840
either a Confounder, a Mediator or an
Effect modifier.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,000
And I'll go over in turn with you what
each of those variables is.

28
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,450
I'm going to try to start each week with
at least one teaser.

29
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,310
This is just something I'm going to
preview something that we're

30
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,000
going to be talking about in the future
modules just to get you thinking.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,040
So this was an interesting example that
was looking at gender bias or

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,230
potential of gender bias at Berkeley.

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,930
Now this was back in the 1970s and

34
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,640
this was dealing with graduate admissions
to graduate school at Berkeley.

35
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,360
Of course we probably were more worried
about overt gender bias back in the 1970s.

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,810
And somebody went ahead and

37
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,167
looked at the admissions data to graduate
school at Berkeley one year in the,

38
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:06,720
in the 70s and you can see the data
represented in a two-by-two table.

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,010
You can see at that point, back in the
70s,

40
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,176
more men apply to graduate school than
women.

41
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:12,920
1,835 women versus 2,681 men.

42
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,150
But if you look at who got into graduate
school and

43
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,670
who didn't, indeed the women were denied
at a higher rate.

44
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,410
So I can calculate the risk ratio in the
way that we talked about last week here.

45
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,090
And it turns out that the risk ratio is
1.25.

46
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,670
I would interpret that as that women were
25% more likely to be

47
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,770
denied admission to graduate school at
Berkeley than men.

48
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,860
So of course, people were up in arms about
this there was a lawsuit but

49
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,970
there's actually something else going on
here besides gender bias and

50
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,450
that relates to the material we're
going to talk about this week.

51
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,960
So, we'll get back to this in a future
module and

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,780
actually tease through the numbers, in a
little more detail.
