1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,520
Good morning, students.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,640
This is Kaplan-Meier part two, how to Read
Kaplan-Meier Curves.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,340
For this video we are going to look at two
sets of data from,

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,260
from the actual clinical literature.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,360
So, here we go.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,750
This is the result of a clinical trial
comparing two chemotherapy regimens after

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,190
surgery for colon cancer.

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:30,350
And the two regimens are given here by the
gold and blue lines.

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:36,220
One, is the control arm 5FU plus
Leucavorin, and

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,490
the other is the experimental arm,

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:46,080
which is 5FU plus Leucavorin plus the
experimental drug, Oxaliplatin.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,920
[COUGH]

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,900
And what is being measured here, is
disease free survival.

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,220
In other words, the patient has had
surgery and there is no evidence of

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,680
disease following surgery, but of course,
there's a a risk for recurrence.

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,890
And so the patient may have a recurrence.

17
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,677
So the question is,

18
00:01:05,677 --> 00:01:12,215
what is the proportion of patients who are
disease-free after surgery?

19
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:17,650
And the time axis shows data up to four
years following surgery.

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,330
Now, the first thing we notice is that,
the curves are very smooth and

21
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,520
in fact, it's a pretty large clinical
trial.

22
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,524
The number of patients enrolled in the
study are shown here.

23
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:38,300
1,200 and 1,207 patients in both arms, in
each of the arms.

24
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:42,415
You see a difference between the blue and
the gold curves, and

25
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:45,192
you want to know whether that's
statistically significant,

26
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:47,610
that's given here by the p-value of
0.0034.

27
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,279
So, what you need to know, is what is the
p-value, well the p-value is this.

28
00:01:54,010 --> 00:02:02,400
The p-value equals the probability

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,435
[SOUND] that, this result would

30
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:17,290
occur under the null hypothesis.

31
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,590
Null hypothesis, what is that?

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,986
The null hypothesis is, the hypothesis
that nothing is going on.

33
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:35,742
So, the p-value is 0.34%.

34
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:42,799
That there's a 0.34% likelihood that what
you see here would have occurred

35
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:50,478
with Oxaliplatin, actually having added
nothing to the 5FU and Leucavorin.

36
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:51,580
So the p-value is pretty low,

37
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,680
so it looks like this is highly
statistically significant.

38
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,120
The usual cut off for clinical trials is
that

39
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,086
something is significant if it has a
p-value of less than 0.05.

40
00:03:04,086 --> 00:03:07,220
0.05 would be considered border line of
0.04.

41
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,392
So, being significantly less than that,
suggests that this is a, a,

42
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:12,790
a good clinical trial.

43
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,539
Now, what is the size of the benefit,
that's conferred by Oxaliplatin?

44
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:21,290
That's given by the hazard ratio.

45
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,340
So the hazard ratio.

46
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:30,460
[BLANK_AUDIO]

47
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,819
Is a ratio of hazard rates

48
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:41,448
[SOUND] for the two groups.

49
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:47,816
[SOUND]
Okay?

50
00:03:47,816 --> 00:03:51,140
What is the hazard here?

51
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,530
That hazard here is, the hazard that the
disease would recur.

52
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,610
And the way hazard ratio is defined, is
the convention is, the numerator

53
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,080
is the experimental group, and the cont,
denominator is the control group.

54
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:16,070
And the hazard ratio uses all the data
here calculated by a very clever formula

55
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:23,090
[BLANK_AUDIO]

56
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,280
Calculated by Cox Proportional Hazards.

57
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,943
[BLANK_AUDIO]

58
00:04:27,943 --> 00:04:31,807
[COUGH] And what Cox Proportional Hazards
does, is it makes use for

59
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:35,470
the fact that there is incomplete
information in this trial.

60
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,910
So, another way of looking at hazard is,

61
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,650
in addition to the Cox Proportional
Hazards,

62
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,550
you might want to explain to your patient,
say oh, what,

63
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:54,020
what are the chances that this treatment,
Oxaliplatin, which is not benign at all.

64
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,870
There are significant side effects with
Oxaliplatin.

65
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,193
Most notably pain and tingling in the
fingers and

66
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:06,150
toes which actually can become permanent
in some cases.

67
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,157
So, what, what is the likelihood that
you'll actually get benefit from

68
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:16,163
the Oxaliplatin, in terms of preventing
recurrence of the disease, and

69
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:21,359
you could say to the patient, well, let,
let's look at the two year mark.

70
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:23,431
And at the two year mark,

71
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:30,044
the chance that you would remain
disease-free with just 5FU and Leucavorin,

72
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:36,082
the chance that you would remain
disease-free here, would be 75%.

73
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:42,151
However what would be the chance that you
would be,

74
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:47,962
remain disease free had you added the
Oxaliplatin and

75
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:51,876
that roughly here is about 80%.

76
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:54,740
So, by adding Oxaliplatin,

77
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,830
you increase your chances of being disease
free from 75 to 80%.

78
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,890
So, there's a 5% benefit here.

79
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,840
That means, that if you

80
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:13,600
take the Oxaliplatin there's a 5%
improvement in your disease free survival.

81
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,645
But there's a 95% chance that you wouldn't
have benefited at all.

82
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:22,683
In fact you, even without the Oxaliplatin,

83
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:28,110
there's a 75% chance you would remain
disease free.

84
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,849
And, even if you took the Oxaliplatin,

85
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,200
there's a 20% chance the disease would
come back anyway.

86
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,740
So that's another way of looking at it.

87
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,600
Now, moving on, let's look at a second
curve.

88
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,510
This is a randomized clinical trial
comparing Crizotnib against

89
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,690
standard chemotherapy in patients with
metastatic lung cancer.

90
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,370
And what, they're looking at here is
progression free survival,

91
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,630
and they're measuring it over a period of
months,

92
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,620
because the metastatic lung cancer has a
pretty dismal prognosis.

93
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,220
And what you can see from this clinical
trial immediately,

94
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,331
is that it's a much smaller clinical
trial, far fewer patients are at risk, but

95
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:13,120
the p-value is quite good 0.001.

96
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,970
And not only that, the hazard ratio is
0.49, again a very good number.

97
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,260
What you can see is at the end,

98
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:30,700
because this is a very small clinical
trial, the curves are coming together.

99
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,790
But we should ignore that part of the
curve,

100
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:38,760
because actually the number of patients at
risk is very small.

101
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,230
Now, what is progression free survival.

102
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:54,990
Progression free survival is, will measure
the survival of the patient.

103
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,603
The patients still alive without
progression of disease.

104
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:04,976
So, censor, censoring here would occur for

105
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:12,560
the various reasons that we discussed in
part one.

106
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,602
Lost a follow-up, moved away late entry
into the study or

107
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:20,356
left the study due to toxicity.

108
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:22,757
Now, the events.

109
00:08:22,757 --> 00:08:25,960
[BLANK_AUDIO]

110
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,130
The events are progression of tumor.

111
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,100
So that, the each event causes the curve
to drop, progression of tumor.

112
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,401
Okay?
That's progression free survival, but

113
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:43,360
also death and, and death from any cause,
death from cancer.

114
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,418
Death from toxicity of chemotherapy or
even death in a car crash.

115
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:51,790
Now [COUGH]
this is progression free survival.

116
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,290
Okay?

117
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,775
So there's another thing that we talked
about in part one overall survival.

118
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:05,460
[SOUND]

119
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,400
And overall survival simply uses as
events, death.

120
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,170
It doesn't care about progression of
tumor.

121
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,010
It just measures death, with other
reasons.

122
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,770
Obviously a whole list of reasons for
censoring, which we had gone over.

123
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,230
Now, there's yet another way of measuring
things, and

124
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,800
that's called time to progression.

125
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:31,860
Time to progression is almost, the same as
progression free survival,

126
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:38,260
but not quite, and the reason it's not
quite the same as in time to progression.

127
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,920
One of the reasons for censoring in
addition to all

128
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,610
the other reasons is that deaths are
censored.

129
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,920
So, death from toxicity are censored.

130
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,270
Now, if the patient progresses and dies as
a result of progression.

131
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,180
That would count.

132
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,100
But all other deaths are censored.

133
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:06,630
So, from the FDAs point of view, the FDA
considers overall survival to be the best.

134
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,300
Progression free survival to be next best.

135
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,859
And of course progression free survival
matures more

136
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,160
quickly because there are more events.

137
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:22,210
And then, time to progression, as less
desired than progression free survival.

138
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,560
So there you have it, a quick primer on
how to read Kaplan-Meier curves.

139
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,410
Thank you very much.
