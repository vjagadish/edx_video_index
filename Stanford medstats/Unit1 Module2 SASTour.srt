1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,420
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,240
In this module, we'll give you a tour of
how SAS is laid out.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,760
SAS is a tool that allows users to code,
point and click, and analyze data.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,630
It's relatively user friendly.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,020
For this class,

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,120
you most likely will be using SAS
Enterprise Guide on a remote server.

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,230
>> Let's start by opening SAS Enterprise
Guide.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,379
You first click start, and then click SAS
Enterprise Guide.

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,538
The first thing you' will see is a Welcome
to SAS Enterprise Guide screen.

10
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:38,470
Here, you will have the choice of opening
a project or creating projects.

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,000
In this case, we are going to open an
existing project so

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,770
that we can explain how SAS is set up.

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,640
In essence, a project is just a record of
everything that you do in

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,930
SAS during a specific analysis.

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,950
It keeps track of the data sets that are
used,

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,760
the particular tasks that you have run,
and the results that you've output.

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,630
Here's the main screen, which is called
the workspace.

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,300
On the left of the screen, you have a
project tree.

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,250
The project tree shows you a view of the
project you are working on.

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,200
When you import data, run tasks and

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,790
analyze your data, you will see new icons
added to this area.

22
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,890
In essence, it is simply a hierarchical
view of the project you are working on.

23
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,010
You can easily reorder, rename, delete and
edit the individual items in your project.

24
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,010
The Process Flow window is considered a
relationship window.

25
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:31,570
It takes the components of the project
tree, and creates a web of interactions.

26
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,480
Arrows are added between different icons.

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,730
For example, if you've imported a dataset
and run a specific analysis,

28
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,760
a line will be drawn from the data to the
new analysis icon.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,620
I'm quickly going to show you how to
change the format of SAS Enterprise Guide.

30
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,850
Right now, we're in single view, which is
the standard for SAS.

31
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,540
If you go to View > Workspace Layout, and
then click Side by Side,

32
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,370
you will get your process flow on the left
and your output data on the right.

33
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,645
>> So here we have a data set.

34
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:10,020
A data set is just like a spread sheet
that you are probably used to

35
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,790
seeing in Excel.

36
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,100
In SAS, we typically use separate columns
for

37
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,460
different variables, and we have separate
rows for different subjects.

38
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,310
In this dataset, each row is a different
person in our study.

39
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,520
Reading across the columns,

40
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,720
we have all the different variables that
we measured for that individual person.

41
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,710
For example, here we have a record for a
70 year old woman,

42
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,100
with ID number 161, and these are all the
measurements that we recorded.

43
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,100
SAS allows us to explore our dataset, run
statistical tests, and

44
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,670
create graphics to visualize our data.

45
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,480
So, why use SAS instead of Excel?

46
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,140
While Excel can perform advanced analysis,

47
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,040
it does not keep a clear record of what
you've done.

48
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,740
When you conduct research,

49
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,439
it's really important that your methods
are reproducible and well documented.

50
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,150
SAS provides a systematic way to keep
track of all the steps in your analysis,

51
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,840
so you know exactly what was done to your
data.

52
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,330
When we run a statistical analysis,

53
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,450
we frequently work with datasets that has
hundreds or

54
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,000
even thousands of rows, which can make it
very cumbersome in programs like Excel.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,130
With SAS, we can use code or the point and

56
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,531
click interface to handle all these big
datasets with ease.
