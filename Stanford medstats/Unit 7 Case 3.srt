[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,620
In this next case study, we're going to
talk about a situation where

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,620
making sure you've got the right patient
is really, really going to be critical.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,422
As you can imagine, you know, bleeding is
a factor of you know,

5
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:24,630
patients who are coming to get care.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,041
In this situation,

7
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:30,970
it was an emergency case where a patient
was profusely bleeding.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,960
Emergency blood was needed, and the
medical team was urgently requesting for

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,640
additional blood blood product to be
available so

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,240
they could be able to transfuse it into
the patient.

11
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,620
When the multiple units of blood arrived,
one of the doctors started screaming at

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,890
the staff about getting the blood hung
immediately.

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,270
At the time when this event was occuring,
there was actually a change in

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,234
the nursing staff, and one of the coming
on duty nurse was given a unit of

15
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:07,980
blood by another staff person who was
basically pulling out of the cooler.

16
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,086
That was at the or near the,

17
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:14,880
the area where the resuscitation effort
was going on.

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,110
The nurse grabbed the blood and proceeded
to hang the blood.

19
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,221
You know, that was part of a series of
bags that they were

20
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:23,900
transfusing into the patient.

21
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,790
Unfortunately at the with all the effort
of the medical team,

22
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,930
the response team everyone that
contributed to try to save the patient,

23
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,530
the patient had expired during the
resuscitation attempt.

24
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:43,325
In the process of cleaning up the room
afterwards, several more units of

25
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:47,828
blood showed up at the patient, or at the
outside of the room and

26
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:53,516
the staff looked at it and looked at the
patient name and realized that the patient

27
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:58,910
name on the units of blood was different
from the patient that had just expired.

28
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:04,611
At this point when they look back at the
paperwork and, you know, looked at

29
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:10,013
the patient they recognized that they
probably, towards the end of the case,

30
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:13,736
where they're transfusing the last couple
units of blood,

31
00:02:13,736 --> 00:02:19,430
inadvertently had grabbed blood that was
intended for another patient.

32
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,980
And actually trans, try, or had transfused
that in the patient.

33
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:30,510
The review of the case from pathology
indicated that you know, the patient

34
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:36,030
did not expire from the transfusion, there
was no evidence of molysis, but

35
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:43,270
that the patient had expired from the
significant blood loss.

36
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:49,590
And other medical problems that actually
contributed the patient's demise and

37
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,260
that the transfusion actually was not a
factor.

38
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,916
But nevertheless, this really shouldn't
have been done.

39
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:02,130
You know, they, there are usually clear
cut processes of double checking and

40
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,107
verifying they have the right blood, the
right blood product, you know,

41
00:03:07,107 --> 00:03:11,790
identify the right patient prior to
actually hanging the blood.

42
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,780
So what were some of the factors
identified in this particular event?

43
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,780
And that was certainly the failure to use
two unique patient identification process

44
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,540
by two different individuals to uniquely
confirm and validate that they're working

45
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:36,020
with the right patient, the right blood
product and with the right orders.

46
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,978
Similar to the earlier situation where we
talked about, you know, situations about,

47
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:45,766
you know, high risk medications having a
two person double check process.

48
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:52,816
Both the joint commissions and the
American Association of Blood Banks, AABB.

49
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:58,108
The College of American Pathologists, CAP,
you know, they all have

50
00:03:58,108 --> 00:04:04,670
very specific procedural double-checks
when administering blood to patients.

51
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,214
And in this situation the staff assumed
that the person handing the blood had

52
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:12,196
done the double check and the person who
handed off

53
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:16,130
the blood thought that that person was
going to do the double check.

54
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,856
And in this situation actually nobody
checked and

55
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:24,780
as a result the wrong blood was hung on
the wrong patient.

56
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,158
As others cases that we talked about, you
know,

57
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:29,680
production pressure, certainly a huge
factor.

58
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,870
When that contributed to this event
occurring where, you know,

59
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,430
folks were trying to get blood into this
patient to save the patient's life.

60
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,394
And this urgency emergency situation
creates process variation.

61
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:45,462
And certainly, you know, as part of the
process variation,

62
00:04:45,462 --> 00:04:49,238
the team communication or the lack of
communication in this situation led,

63
00:04:49,238 --> 00:04:52,070
well is a factor in leading to this
particular outcome.

64
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,212
We've talked earlier about distraction
part of the distraction that was

65
00:04:57,212 --> 00:05:01,118
occurring in this situation was the one of
the physician was yelling or

66
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:04,780
screaming at the nurse to, you know, get
the blood hung.

67
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,562
The nurse should've given the instruction
to, you know, the doctor and

68
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:11,734
says hang on a second, let me do a
double-check to make sure we

69
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:16,070
got the right product here before we
actually hang it in the patient.

70
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,920
And so as a result, you know, the
distraction of being yelled and

71
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,620
screamed at by the physician actually
aggravated the situation.

72
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,380
And the staff just in the process of
trying to respond to

73
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,008
the physician request, varied from their
normal workflow process.

74
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:36,318
Now what's interesting, the culture of
their particular team, for

75
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:42,720
the most part, you'd have to say 99% of
the time it's very, very, very good.

76
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,450
Folks are constantly communicating.

77
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,780
You know, making eye contact.

78
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,450
Reconfirming, and verifying information.

79
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,810
99% of the time, you know, you'd have to
say that, you know,

80
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,550
they're a top notch, well oiled machine.

81
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,710
Everybody on the same page and
functioning.

82
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,430
But in this situation,

83
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,530
a patient who was at one moment sort of a
questionable stability.

84
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,780
Went from, you know,

85
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,990
being kind of there in monitoring
situation into a crisis situation.

86
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,695
Basically taking out, all the cards off
the table and then thrown up

87
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:19,290
in the air and then, you know, you're
throwing in this crisis situation.

88
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,302
So it's interesting in that when do talk
about culture, we also sometimes think

89
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:27,380
about, well, the ongoing culture of a
team, you know, is certainly one part.

90
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,620
But, but does the culture of the team
change when there's a crisis or

91
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,240
an, emergent, urgent situation.

92
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,980
And that's where programs like simulation,
you know, when you're thrown into crisis

93
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,120
situation and, you know, gone through a
simulation to see how you would react and

94
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,520
then lessons you can learn, is actually
very,

95
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,800
very beneficial in trying to prevent, you
know, these things from happening.

96
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,940
You remember I said earlier nobody woke up
that morning of the day of

97
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,666
this event occurred thinking I am
intentionally going to go out and

98
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,800
hurt patients or kill patients.

99
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,210
Nobody on the team thought that, but
certainly because of

100
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,820
the factors that we've identified here
through the review of this event.

101
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,370
You know, we've got a lot of things that
we can work on to improve on, and

102
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,340
one of the key things of course is just
being aware of the situation and following

103
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,980
standard work or standard process of doing
things like a double check.

104
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,310
Being able to communicate verbally.

105
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,190
Being able to provide feedback.

106
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,730
Not being distracted.

107
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,520
Are all key things that we would like to
see implemented on an ongoing basis.

108
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,240
So, we have some lessons learned.

109
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,028
You know, the Joint Commission does
require two individuals perform a two

110
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:45,134
patient identification check prior to
administering blood.

111
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:48,302
The thought is that these individuals are
generally

112
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:53,120
individual are determined qualified,
licensed personnel that are trained to be

113
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,410
involved with the blood transfusion
process, and that they have a process to

114
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,390
be able to perform the double check before
they administer the blood.

115
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:05,951
Certainly lessons learned about the
frightening nature of the case,

116
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:08,900
disrupt of the communication between the
team members.

117
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,190
Remember we said earlier that, you know,
someone was yelling at the nurse.

118
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,060
The nurse just showed up to help out.

119
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,950
And most folks when they're in that crisis
situation will just jump in to

120
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,810
do whatever they need to do.

121
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,230
However, there was a bit of
miscommunication where the folks didn't

122
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,580
bother to do double checks to make sure
they got the right product in hand.

123
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,192
And in fact, transfused the wrong product
into the patient.

124
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:37,027
As we said earlier, you know, it did not,
you know,

125
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:42,220
it's identify that this action didn't kill
the patient, didn't harm the patient.

126
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,910
But what happened if the patient had
survived the event?

127
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,760
They might have been able to survive the
resuscitative effort, but they wouldn't

128
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,870
survive the sequel of actually getting the
wrong blood type administered to them.

129
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,560
Another factor that was identified, and

130
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,824
this is something we kind of mentioned
before in other cases,

131
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:06,240
when the environment is not conducive to
the normal standard operating process.

132
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,920
The space in this particular area is very
limited.

133
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,586
Especially when the patient started to
crash.

134
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,917
And so, when the patient started to crash,

135
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:18,460
more staff showed up to assist in the
resuscitative effort.

136
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,300
And in that process, actually, it screened
out or blocked out the ability for

137
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,320
some of the staff to do the double check
of the patient's wristband to

138
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,605
make sure they got the right patient.

139
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:32,504
So this was something that the team
certainly learned about you know,

140
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:36,870
having space available, or clearing space
to make more room available.

141
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,700
Especially when you have additional staff,
and

142
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,900
additional equipment showing up at the
patient's bedside.

143
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,250
And that there may be a need to develop a
secondary way of

144
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,192
actually identifying the patient.

145
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,932
In many organizations, you know,

146
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:52,610
they put a wristband around one of the
patient's arm.

147
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,170
They also put it around the patient's
ankle.

148
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,730
Just so they have a secondary double check
in the event that these kinds of

149
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,220
situations occur.

150
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,260
So those are all certain som, some lessons
learned from this particular event.

151
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,154
And you know, the department makes a point
of sharing this kind of

152
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:12,322
information with the staff as part of
their onboarding or

153
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:15,226
their orientation to let them know that,
you know,

154
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:19,780
when we have urgent emergent situation it
throws a kink into things, and

155
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,790
it can shift the dynamics in such a way
with that it can adversely harm patients.

156
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,770
So, you know, it's something you really do
need to be aware of.

157
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:33,030
Some of the prevention strategies, that
was learned from this particular event.

158
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,050
The culture of safety that we spoke about
earlier.

159
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:42,400
Folks need to be in a position to be able
to push back when necessary.

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,990
The, the fact is if the nurse, you know,

161
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,050
had double checked when they pulled the
blood out of the cooler.

162
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,640
If the nurse prior to hanging it had du,
done the double-check.

163
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,540
If the nurse or they would've tell the
doctor who was screaming at them in

164
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,400
their face, you know, hurry up put the
blood in.

165
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,421
And say, hold on a second, I got it, give
me a chance to do it right.

166
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:08,545
This would alleviate, the hours of
investigator work in meetings, and

167
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:12,706
interviews that occurred after this event
occurred.

168
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:17,458
You know, this is all under the concept of
lean methodology where as a result of

169
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:22,473
this event, there's a ton of what I would
describe as learnings from this event.

170
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:26,865
But at the same time, all the wasted
energy that went into the meetings,

171
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:31,113
the reviews, the chart reviews, the risk
management involvement,

172
00:11:31,113 --> 00:11:35,630
the lawyers involved, you know, the
department chair, the resident.

173
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,270
You know, everyone who is involved in
reviewing the event and

174
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:44,100
in reality it's non productive, other than
coming up with solutions to be able to

175
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,580
fix these things to keep it from happening
again.

176
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,000
So, the ability to push back is easier
said than done.

177
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,240
I know many of you folks are thinking, its
like, oh my gosh, you know,

178
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,534
it's like of course it would be clear that
I would tell that person,

179
00:11:57,534 --> 00:12:00,200
hang on a second, let me carry this task
out.

180
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,680
But, or, how would you react is, if you're
in that crisis situation, and

181
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,440
you're giving the instruction and the
staff said, hang on a second, you know,

182
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,196
let me double check to make sure it's
right.

183
00:12:12,196 --> 00:12:16,748
Would you react in a way that's actually
conducive to a culture of safety?

184
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:17,670
Second bullet.

185
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,150
Communication of hand, handoff practices
especially in emergent situations.

186
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,066
Many organizations adopt things like S
BAR.

187
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:33,270
It's an acronym that stands for situation
background assessment and recommendation.

188
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,262
You know, this communication handoff, you
know,

189
00:12:36,262 --> 00:12:40,138
is kind of like similar to the flight
controllers in, in,

190
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:45,170
the flight, you know, the control towers
at airports, where there's a specific

191
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:50,130
communication methodology between the
pilots and, and flight control.

192
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,810
And because of their specific
communication,

193
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,120
the intent of it is to make sure the
communication is crystal clear.

194
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,550
Both from the sender standpoint to the
receiver standpoint.

195
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,897
You know, do you have that same setup when
you're working with your team,

196
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:10,796
especially in crisis urgent emergent
situation in terms of how you're going to

197
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:14,039
communicate things so that people are on
the same page,

198
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:17,810
of the same mindset, of that same, single
mindset.

199
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,110
And so that everyone knows that they're
doing the right thing, for

200
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,160
that, you know, for that patient at that
particular situation.

201
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:30,390
Another thought was, was re, regarding
repeat back instruction for confirmation.

202
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,670
We kind of mentioned this earlier, with
the flight control tower.

203
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,070
To the pilots in an airplane.

204
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:44,170
You know, some of you are pilots and, and
know that the instruction back or

205
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,940
confirmation back, you know, you, you can
use that piece of information to verify or

206
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,522
validate to make sure that were on the
same page.

207
00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:56,060
There's a reliance on that process that
everyone's on the same page and

208
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,830
that the reason why we do this is that we
don't want to have planes, you know,

209
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,092
landing where they're not supposed to land
or

210
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,840
hitting things that they're not supposed
to hit.

211
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,029
And the same can be said in the clinical
care setting, you know, whether it's the,

212
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:12,418
in emergency department like this
situation, or is on the floor.

213
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:17,746
It's not uncommon, you know, in, in less
urgent situation, such as making rounds

214
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:22,852
to the, through you know, seeing all your
patients or seeing patient at clinic,

215
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:27,662
is that instructions are constantly being
given both to staff and patient and

216
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:29,177
other providers.

217
00:14:29,177 --> 00:14:32,177
But are you sure they receive the
information in

218
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:36,210
the way that you intended so that they can
carry it out?

219
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:36,840
You know, this is

220
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,400
oftentimes a challenge when we're dealing
with patients, you know?

221
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,023
We give them tons of information in terms
of what to do about their condition, or

222
00:14:44,023 --> 00:14:45,440
the disease process.

223
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,830
And, then we're expecting them to be able
to read what we gave them.

224
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,210
Well, how do we actually know they
understand what's going on?

225
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,160
And you really are hoping they follow the
instructions, or

226
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,945
they understand what's going on.

227
00:14:56,945 --> 00:15:00,545
But it isn't until follow 'em, follow them
up on a followup visit or,

228
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:04,385
you know, if you get called that they
ended up in the emergency department or

229
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:08,765
the urgent care center, you know, that you
find out that they didn't understand what

230
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:11,760
the instructions were that you had given
'em.

231
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,890
The last bullet, and this has a lot to do
with the fact that, you know,

232
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,520
the team being aware of what's going on,
you know.

233
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,408
And what we would describe as situational
awareness.

234
00:15:23,408 --> 00:15:28,304
Many time when the adrenaline gets going,
and that the intensity level

235
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:34,490
increase you know, folks, you know, react
very differently in those situations.

236
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,780
And as a result, situational awareness is
that,

237
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,290
it's almost like just a concept of knowing
where everything is and

238
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,270
what everything, you know, what is going
on with that situation.

239
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,860
For some people the clock speeds up faster
where they can't keep up with it.

240
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,398
And other folks, it actually, the clock
seems to slow down, you know,

241
00:15:53,398 --> 00:15:55,630
when these things happen.

242
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,843
I've found that when those of us who can
actually react, and

243
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:00,640
this comes through experience.

244
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,764
And sometimes it's our personality, and

245
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:05,667
sometimes it's, you know, its the way we
were trained.

246
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:09,883
But certainly, when the clock slows down
and you can analyze all the data that's

247
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:14,500
coming in and all the steps that are
happening, all the action that's going on.

248
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,960
You'll be in a better position to be able
to provide instruction or

249
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,394
to be able to carry out a task.

250
00:16:20,394 --> 00:16:23,496
The same, the same thing can be said that
you know,

251
00:16:23,496 --> 00:16:27,918
[LAUGH] there's across the country there's
a lot of legislation looking at

252
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:32,406
the ability of people as they're driving
to be able to be on the cell phone and

253
00:16:32,406 --> 00:16:35,460
texting, and or texting at the same time.

254
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,139
Heck, I've been in enough places across
the country,

255
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:41,040
I think people just have a problem with
driving alone.

256
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,900
But then when you add cell phone
conversation, texting you know,

257
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,087
drink, drinking coffee or

258
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:53,491
soda while they're driving, while shaving
or putting on their makeup.

259
00:16:53,491 --> 00:16:58,547
You know, it's not uncommon this
multitasking creates distraction which

260
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:01,718
takes away from situational awareness.

261
00:17:01,718 --> 00:17:04,474
One of the advantages of simulation
training that, you know,

262
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:07,560
I would highly encourage people to go
through simulation training.

263
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,030
Especially if they provide video feedback
or

264
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:15,300
instructional feedback after the scenario,
you know, the simulation is ran through.

265
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,242
Becomes a real behavior modification or a
kind of a adjustment in

266
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:24,133
terms of how you react, how you respond,
or how you even present or dis, or, or

267
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:28,270
say things to people in these different
situations.

268
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,830
So situational awareness is really, really
key.

269
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,470
And it's not something you can just read a
book about and get it.

270
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,890
It's almost like you have to go through
these scenarios to be able to

271
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,680
experience it, to be able to see how you
would react in those particular situation.

272
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,830
And ultimately, you know, the goal which
we've talked about all along in

273
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,550
this program is trying to do the right
thing for your patients.
