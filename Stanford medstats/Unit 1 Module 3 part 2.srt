1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,140
Now we're talking about the different
shapes of the distribution as

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,240
a left-skewed or right-skewed, so let me
just summarize this.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,910
So left-skewed means that you have a left
tail.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,365
So you have a few extreme values that are
low to the left.

5
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:16,210
Right-skewed means you have a right tail,
so

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,500
a few extreme values that are high to the
right.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,470
And of course symmetric means just what it
sounds like,

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,791
you have a nice symmetric distribution.

9
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:26,870
There's a special type of symmetric
distribution called a bell curve or

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,340
a normal distribution that we're going to
talk about a lot in this course.

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,600
So I'm just going to introduce it now to
just get you thinking about it.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,400
So a bell curve is just what it sounds
like, it follows the shape of a bell.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,630
It turns out to be very important in
statistics for a number of reasons.

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,390
So I'll just say a little bit more about
it now.

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,520
So the reason it's important is, for

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,550
one thing, it has sort of a predictable
behavior that makes it very useful.

17
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,580
So it turns out that if you're on a
perfect normal curve

18
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,430
that 68% of your observations will fall
somewhere between one standard

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,915
deviation below the mean to one standard
deviation above the mean.

20
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:09,865
95% of your observations will fall within
two standard deviations of the mean and

21
00:01:09,865 --> 00:01:13,150
99.7% will fall within three standard
deviations of the mean.

22
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,120
If you don't know what a standard
deviation is,

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,170
don't worry we're going to talk about that
in an upcoming module this week.

24
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,820
But, it has nice predictable behavior so

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,310
that's very useful for calculating
statistics.

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,320
Another reason the normal distribution
comes up a lot is that many traits that we

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,420
might measure in a population follow a
normal distribution.

28
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,590
There's lots of traits that don't follow a
normal distribution but

29
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,720
there's a number that actually follow a
normal distribution.

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,940
So things like IQ and height tend to fall
on a bell curve.

31
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,700
So that's another reason it comes up a
lot.

32
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,620
Finally, the most important reason that
the normal distribution is so

33
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,240
important in statistics is actually that
statistics themselves tend

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,360
to follow a normal distribution.

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,410
And this is a bit of a tricky concept.

36
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,330
But it's something that I want to plant in
your head now because we're going to

37
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,420
be talking about this in great detail in a
couple of weeks.

38
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,780
So it turns out that statistics, things we
measure from our data like means and

39
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,450
odds ratios and regression coefficients.

40
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,430
Those also have a distribution.

41
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,830
And it's a tricky concept because, if you
think, like I'm, I do a study.

42
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,820
I measure one mean in my sample.

43
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,080
How does a single mean have a
distribution?

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,800
Well, it's something that is a theoretical
construct.

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,540
But, it turns out that that distribution
if often a normal distribution.

46
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,460
And, that's really the reason that the
normal distribution is so so

47
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,498
important in statistics.

48
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:38,540
So I'm going to end here with just

49
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,370
showing you some histograms of the data
from my Stanford students.

50
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,950
I think it's always fun to look at
histograms of real data.

51
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,580
So for

52
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,540
example, I asked my students to rate their
optimism on a scale from 0 to a 100.

53
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,750
And you can see that, you know,

54
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,910
most of my students are feeling pretty
optimistic when they took this survey.

55
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,690
I did have a handful.

56
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,630
Out to the left, we would describe this as
having a bit of a left skew.

57
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,560
There were a some students who were more
on the pessimistic range.

58
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,920
[SOUND] I asked them about their daily
fruit and

59
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,220
vegetable consumption and servings per
day.

60
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,950
And you're suppose to ear five servings of
fruits and vegetables per day.

61
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,320
Not everyone was meeting that.

62
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,870
But in general my students are pretty
healthy.

63
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,170
They were doing a pretty good job.

64
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,246
I even have students eating six, eight,
ten fruits or vegetables a day.

65
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:26,110
Interestingly, this distribution would
have been a nice normal curve except that

66
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,150
we're missing the left tail, right?

67
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,280
There wasn't anybody who was eating no
fruits and vegetables everyday,

68
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,050
which is a good thing and so we're missing
a little bit of a left tail there.

69
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,480
If we would have had some people eating
none,

70
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,760
this would've made sort of a bell curve.

71
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,350
Here's another interesting variable.

72
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,210
I asked them how many, how much homework
they did in hours per week and

73
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,660
you can see that there was a wide eye.

74
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,370
I got a wide set of answers here.

75
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,190
So for those of you who're out there for a
full-time student you'll

76
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,730
be very interested in how much homework my
students were doing.

77
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,100
To be fair,

78
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,830
I asked some of the students this question
at the very beginning of the year.

79
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,802
So, maybe some of them didn't have any
homework yet but

80
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:05,584
that the homework by the way coming in
later.

81
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:09,170
I had a lot of students reporting 0 to 5
hours of homework per week but

82
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,830
then I have a really big right skew, a big
right tail here with

83
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,380
some students reporting as many as 40
hours per week of homework.

84
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,600
[SOUND] I ask my students about alcohol
drinking,

85
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,250
how many alcoholic drinks do you drink per
week?

86
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,740
My students are fairly light drinkers, as
you can see.

87
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,390
I don't tend to teach undergraduates.

88
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,720
I mostly teach graduate students and
medical students and doctors.

89
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,110
And they were fairly light drinkers.

90
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,600
The heaviest drinking I had reported here
was 7 or 8 drinks per week.

91
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,820
And most people are drinking just zero to
three drinks per week.

92
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,180
Finally a question I always like to ask my
students is how they feel about math.

93
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,064
And, I ask them to rate their feelings
about math on a scale of 0 to 100.

94
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:51,180
0 being really horrible feelings about
math, and 100 being they love math,

95
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,480
they go home every day and do math just
for fun.

96
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,290
And so, you can see there is a wide range
of feelings about math in my students.

97
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,610
A lot of the students tend to be
favorable.

98
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,140
But I definitely have some people in the
unfavorable range.

99
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,270
And interestingly enough, this variable of
all of the ones that I've shown you so

100
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,130
far, turns out to be the closest to a
normal distribution.

101
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,620
And certainly not a perfect normal
[INAUDIBLE] distribution.

102
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,650
A perfect normal curve.

103
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,440
But it's actually the closest of the
variables that I've shown you so far.
