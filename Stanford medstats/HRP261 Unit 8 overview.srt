00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,740
Welcome to week eight.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,860
In the last couple of weeks we've been
talking about model building.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,270
This week we're going to switch modes and
I'm going to tell you about some

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,460
additional models that are available to
you when you have discreet outcomes.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,150
Besides just a binary logistic model that
we've been talking about so far.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,370
So if you look at the medical literature,
when you have discreet outcomes.

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,820
By and large, across the medical
literature you'll see that

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:36,470
typically people will choose to use binary
logistic regression to analyze that data.

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,790
However, you're not restricted to binary
logistic regression.

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,580
There's a whole host of other models that
are available to

12
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,623
you when you have [INAUDIBLE] outcomes.

13
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:50,710
And for example, if you have ca, a
categorical outcome where there are more

14
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,150
than two levels, you could collapse those
categories into just two but

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,140
there's no reason that you have to do
that.

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,850
You could instead choose to do something
called multinomial logistic regression or

17
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,010
ordinal logistic regression.

18
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,370
Also, sometimes you'll have count data.

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,700
Count data are technically discrete, they
are not continuous, right,

20
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,440
because counts can only take on the value
zero, one, two, three, etc.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,760
Now sometimes when we get count data,

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,220
if it turns out to have a large range of
possible counts, when you look at

23
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,050
the distribution of that count data it may
turn out that if the mean is somewhere.

24
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,520
Quite of a lot higher than zero and
there's a large range of possible counts.

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,260
If you look at the frequency distribution,
the histogram, it may turn out that

26
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,740
those counts look close enough to a normal
distribution that you may decide that you

27
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,610
just want to analyze that with linear
regression and that's perfectly fine.

28
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,860
However, count data often do not look that
way.

29
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,790
So typically with count data, you'll see
something that seems more like this.

30
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,200
You have a lot people down around zero,
one, two,

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,370
three, low numbers of events, and then you
have some kind of right tail.

32
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,120
That certainly is not a normal
distribution.

33
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,020
And if you have data that looks like that,
then it's preferable to analyse that count

34
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,230
data with something called the Poisson
regression, or

35
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,330
negative binomial regression.

36
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,170
So there's a lot of other choices besides
just the binary logistic model that we've

37
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,390
focused on so far.

38
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,130
I'll just mention that I focused on the
binary logistic model for

39
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,520
talking about the general principles of
model building, but

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,680
those principles would apply to these
models as well.

41
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,640
They're transferable principles.

42
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,790
Of course each of these models will have
its own little idiosyncrasies in

43
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,320
terms of the assumptions that you have to
check and

44
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,750
exactly what measures you're getting out
of the model.

45
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,300
But by and

46
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,340
large, those principles of model building
will apply to these models as well.

47
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,270
And just a little preview of the types of
data that we're going to be

48
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,620
talking about this week.

49
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,070
So later this week again we're going to be
talking about count data.

50
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,630
And I found some, an example data set that
was looking at the outcome here as counts.

51
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:02,820
The outcome is the number of world records
in swimming that are broken each year.

52
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,270
And that's a count because obviously you
can't break one and

53
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,150
a half world records, you have to break an
even number.

54
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,942
And those data are shown plotted here from
1969 to 2009

55
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,340
this is the number of world records that
were broken each year.

56
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,300
And there are a lot of different events in
swimming, and there's men's swimming and

57
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,440
women's swimming so there's a lot of
possible.

58
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,710
Records to be broken.

59
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,210
So kind of a large number get, can be
broken in any given year.

60
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,860
But whats interesting if you look at the
pattern here.

61
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,770
there, the number of records being broken
was pretty high in the early 70s and

62
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:36,640
then it kind of goes down and there's not
as many record being broken in the 1990s.

63
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,740
Maybe we've kind of peaked in terms of
technology and things.

64
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,540
But then all of a sudden there's this
spike back up as you

65
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,400
look in the 2000's and that probably has
to do with new technology, new types of

66
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,550
swim wear that have actually made a lot of
world records in swimming fall.

67
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,230
And therefore we could choose to analyze
these data with something like

68
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,510
a Poisson regression or a negative
binomial regression.

69
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,600
Those models are specifically for count
data.
