1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,500
Now, let me tell you about an example
trial called the SPORT trial.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,250
This trial actually, generated a lot of
controversy and

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,200
a lot of discussion about
intention-to-treat analysis.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,290
So this was a randomized trial, and

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,910
they were looking at patients with disc
herniation, with low back pain.

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,250
And it's unclear whether or not these
patients benefit from surgery.

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,060
We'd like to do a randomized trial to
answer that question.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:29,980
So, this was a two year randomized trial
of 501 patients with disk herniation.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,410
245 of them were assigned to receive
surgery, lumbar discectomy.

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:38,040
And, 256 were assigned to receive standard
non-operative care to not get surgery.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,270
It turns out to be pretty hard to recruit
for this kind of randomized trial,

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,970
because people don't want to leave up to
fate whether or not they get surgery.

13
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,740
They kind of want to make that decision on
their own,

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,050
even if it's unclear that surgery has any
benefits.

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,640
And, you can see that they also did a
parallel observational cohort study.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,890
So, there were 743 patients who refused
randomization,

17
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,870
didn't want to be in the randomized trial,
but

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,790
agreed to be enrolled in a parallel
observational cohort study.

19
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,550
They got to select whether they got
surgery For nonoperative care but

20
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,620
they agreed to be followed and their data
collected.

21
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,270
And you can see that a great majority of
patients actually self-selected to

22
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,910
receive surgery.

23
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,580
They were pretty sure that they wanted to
do something proactive even though we

24
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,280
don't know if surgery is effective.

25
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,410
The outcomes here were three months, one
year and two year changes.

26
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,420
On some subjective scales of pain,
physical function and disability.

27
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,680
Now what was interesting is that there was
a lot of nonadherence.

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,550
Again, this is really typical of
randomized trials.

29
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,040
So by the end of two years, only 60% of
those who were randomized to

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,470
the surgery group had actually received
surgery.

31
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,280
So just because you're randomized to the
surgery group doesn't mean you're

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,040
going to go through with it, only 60% went
through with it.

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,310
And also, interestingly, almost half, 45%
of those who

34
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,270
were randomized to the control group, the
nonoperative care group,

35
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,880
eventually went on to receive surgery
within those two years.

36
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,710
So, you know, people are still having
pain,

37
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,340
they want to do something proactive, so
they decide to go and

38
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,360
get the surgery anyway, so a lot of
switching groups in this trail.

39
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,420
Now, let me show you the results.

40
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,460
So there's Three ways that the data were
presented.

41
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,190
So first of all,

42
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,370
the primary analysis for the randomized
trial was an intention-to-treat analysis.

43
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,560
Generally, most people with randomized
trial data will choose

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,760
an intention-to-treat analysis as primary
for the reasons we've talked about.

45
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,330
They also then as a secondary analysis
broke intention-to-treat and

46
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,020
said well let's look at who actually got
surgery versus who didn't.

47
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,710
And then finally they have the results of
the observational cohort study where

48
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,751
people self-selected.

49
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,370
So any intention to treat analysis, they
literally said okay, if you

50
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,500
were randomized to surgery, we're going to
take your change in bodily pain, physical

51
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,520
function and disability, your change
scores over the time period of the study.

52
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,480
And we're going to average together
everybody who was randomized to

53
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,460
surgery, and then we're going to average
together everybody who was randomized to

54
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,130
the non-operative group.

55
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,820
And when they do that, they see that there
is a slight, slight benefit for surgery.

56
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,030
So for bodily pain and physical function,

57
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,820
you want this to be positive, that way a
positive indicates an improvement, for

58
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,110
disability you want it to go down, so
negative indicates an improvement.

59
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,650
So the surgery group did slightly better
on all three measures, but

60
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,860
you can see it's clearly not statistically
significant and a very small effect.

61
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,470
However, what was interesting is that in
the as treated analysis, when they looked

62
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,180
at patients who actually got surgery
versus those who did not get surgery.

63
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,470
Then, there is a benefit for surgery, so
the surgery group, the actual

64
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,050
surgery group did quite a bit of better on
bodily pain, physical function and

65
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,780
capability and these were statistically
significant differences between the group.

66
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,330
For the observational cohort study was
very similar to

67
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,250
the Non-Intension-to-Treat Analysis from
the randomized trial at their benefit for

68
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,940
those who are self-selected to surgery.

69
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,880
This generated a lot of controversy and

70
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,109
a lot of discussion because what do you
make up these results.

71
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,490
One could argue that the intention to
treat analysis,

72
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,510
we know when there's a lot of noise and

73
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,420
a lot of switching around of groups that
that's going to dilute effects, so

74
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,380
maybe we diluted our effects so much that
we're not seeing much of a benefit.

75
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,710
On the other hand, one could argue that
the non intention to treat analysis.

76
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,610
And then, of course, the observational
cohort study, are subject to confounding.

77
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,290
And therefore, that the benefits that
we're seeing are due to confounding,

78
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,980
rather than to a true benefit for surgery.

79
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,190
Or, in this case, you, there also might be
a placebo effect.

80
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,360
Because clearly, somebody you know back
pain is fairly subjective.

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,490
So somebody who gets the surgery might
just think that they feel

82
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,310
better because of a placebo effect.

83
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,340
It's, it's hard to know, you know ,what
the explanation is here.

84
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,350
And interestingly this study has now been
falled out with these patients,

85
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,200
these patients have been falled to the
eight years.

86
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,980
The intention to treat results still are
very similar when you follow it out to

87
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,730
eight years, a couple of these secondary
outcomes, have a small benefit for

88
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,190
surgery similar to here.

89
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,010
But by eight years achieves statistical
significance, so

90
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,850
maybe a slight benefit to surgery.

91
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,980
But still, the effects are very, very
small.

92
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,390
So it may be that surgery is helpful, or
it may just be that people who

93
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:14,390
choose to have surgery do better for other
reasons, and it's hard to differentiate.

94
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,150
Those are some of the frustrations
sometimes with intention to tell a treat

95
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,890
analysis that if it comes out to be null,
it's hard to know what to conclude.

96
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,600
When you're planning for an intention to
treat analysis,

97
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,200
you'll of course want to factor in the
kinds of things we've talked about.

98
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,110
Switching groups into your statistical
power calculations into your

99
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,990
sample size calculations to make you sure
that you have enough people to allow for

100
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,350
this kind of variability and noise.

101
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,390
Finally, the last thing that's important
to talk about with intention to

102
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:47,010
treat analysis is I've been saying once
randomized, always analyzed.

103
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,080
So that means, anybody who gets
randomized,

104
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,690
that you've got to analyze their data at
the end of the day.

105
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,230
But what happens if people never come back
for any follow up measurements?

106
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,220
So you have maybe baseline data on
somebody, but

107
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,500
you have zero follow up measurements on
them.

108
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,510
Or, they come back for

109
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,830
some of the follow up measurements, but
not all of the follow up measurements.

110
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,770
That of course, can happen in a randomized
trial.

111
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,880
How do you analyze them if you don't have
all their data?

112
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,910
So that's one of the major issues with
actually applying the intention-to-treat.

113
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,060
principle.

114
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,010
Now, the best way to deal with missing
data is actually to avoid it altogether.

115
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:24,000
So, really, a high quality study is the
way to deal with missing data.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,230
Because you follow up withy everybody very
carefully, you try.

117
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,860
As much as possible to avoid having
missing data.

118
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,740
That's the best case scenario is that you
get the data on everybody.

119
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,380
That gets to doing a well-designed,
high-quality study.

120
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,510
So that's, that's the idea.

121
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,092
We would want to start there.

122
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:43,360
Of course, it's probably you know,

123
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,990
with most real trials, some missing data
is unavoidable.

124
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,380
So what do you do with missing data?

125
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,372
So, first of all,

126
00:06:49,372 --> 00:06:53,030
there are statistical tests that handle
incomplete follow up data.

127
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,600
So we've seen that Cox regression for
example.

128
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,320
If a person is followed you know, for some
amount of time in the study but

129
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,960
then it's a lot to follow up.

130
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,560
We can at least count them for the time
that they were visible in

131
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,400
the sense that were, that we had follow
data on them.

132
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,280
Similarly we're going to talk in the next
few weeks about things call mixed

133
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,840
model and generalizing estimating
equation.

134
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,900
Yes, there are missing value for some of
the follow up measurement but

135
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,180
not all of them, those models can handle
that really well as well.

136
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,500
We can also do imputation.

137
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,370
So we can make some guesses about what
those measurements would of

138
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,560
been had those person come back for their
follow-up.

139
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,500
One very simple one we'll talk about in
the next few weeks is

140
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,270
something called last observation carried
forward.

141
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,390
So, you could you just take, you know,

142
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,050
if you're looking at a continuous outcome
you can take the outcome like the scale,

143
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,500
the bodily pain scale, whatever was the
last observation you saw, and

144
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,360
then you could carry it forward to all
their missed observations.

145
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,060
That's a simple imputation method.

146
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,560
There are, of course many ways to impute
missing data.

147
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,870
We can also do what's called an extreme
case analysis.

148
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,290
So you can sort of take the worse case and

149
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,990
best case scenario and just see how would
that affect your results.

150
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,680
So if you imagine that everybody, you try
an analysis where

151
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,810
you say that everybody who was missing
follow up data had a bad outcome.

152
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,480
See what the results look like, what your
relative risks look like in that scenario.

153
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,330
And then, you try and

154
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,160
say, well what if everybody who has no
follow update had a good outcome.

155
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,930
How, how extreme, how could that affect my
relative risk or

156
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,330
my effect size at the end of the day?

157
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,050
So, you, kind of, look at the extremes and
see...

158
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,240
That will give you some boundaries on

159
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,140
how much that missing data might affect
your results.

160
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,890
You can do something that, sort of, is
similar to that, but covers a wide range,

161
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,820
a wider range of scenarios, which is to do
a sensitivity analysis and

162
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,600
try a bunch of different things possible
things that could have happened,

163
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,910
possible outcomes for that missing data,
so maybe, for

164
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,260
example, instead of Saying that everybody
who didn't come back had a good outcome.

165
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,140
What if 10% of people who have missing
data had a good outcome.

166
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,760
Or 20%, or 30%.

167
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,840
You can try sort of a broader range of
scenarios, again to get a sense of

168
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,120
how big of an effect that missing data
might have had on your results.
