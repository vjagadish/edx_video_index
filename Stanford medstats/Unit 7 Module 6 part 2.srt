1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,420
So now, I'm going to review the
Kaplan-Meier statistics.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,090
So the Kaplan-Meier curve is

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,720
a non-parametric estimate of the survival
function.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,950
All that means is that we're not trying to
say, oh,

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,850
this survival function follows an
exponential distribution.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,960
Or a specific distribution, a specific
shape.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,730
We're just defining the survival function.

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,340
Whenever events occur, we define the
survival function.

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,550
So, it's an empirical estimate of the
survival function.

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,640
It's just what is the probability of
surviving past certain times in

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,820
the sample taking into account censoring.

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,890
If there was no censoring.

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,790
If people didn't drop out of the study at
different times.

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,110
In fact, this would be a very easy thing
to estimate.

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,050
But the, the trick to Kaplan-Meier is that
it's accommodating that censoring.

16
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:50,300
And the Kaplan-Meier curves, we're going
to draw some Kaplan-Meier curves.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,542
Those can be compared statistically to get
a P value with a log-rank and

18
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:58,020
a log-rank test is just a type of
chi-square test.

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,860
So, let me just show you how this works
very briefly with a simple example.

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,295
You have five subjects who start a study.

21
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:07,630
And let's say that the first event that
happens in

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,598
the study is that subject E dies four
months into the study.

23
00:01:10,598 --> 00:01:15,850
We're going to define the survival curve
here right at four months,

24
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,320
whenever events occur.

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,840
So, we're going to go to our curve.

26
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,620
Our curve starts at 100%, but at four
months Subject E dies.

27
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,220
So, we drop our curve.

28
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,124
The survival probability now goes down to
80%.

29
00:01:27,124 --> 00:01:29,742
4 out of 5 survived that event time.

30
00:01:29,742 --> 00:01:31,840
4 out of 5 survive past four months, so

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,900
our survival probability here is 80%, we
drop the curve down to 80%.

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,490
Let's say the next thing that happens is
that subject A drops out after six months.

33
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,940
They are censored at six months.

34
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,510
We don't know if they went on to die in
the last six months of the study.

35
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,160
But, we know that they were alive through
the first six months of the study.

36
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,240
We're not going to change the curve
because we

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,506
don't know that anybody died there.

38
00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:55,880
But we're going to indicate that on the
curve with a little mark.

39
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,990
Then, the the next thing that happens is
that subjects see dies at seven

40
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,670
months at those sites.

41
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,380
So, that's another event we're going to
change the curve.

42
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,270
We're going to drop the survival curve the
probabilities down seven months.

43
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,120
Notice that I'm indicating at six months,

44
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,980
where subject A dropped out of the study
with a little bar here.

45
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,500
This indicates the censoring that somebody
was dropped out of the study.

46
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,074
We drop our curve down at seven months
when subject C died.

47
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:27,740
Now, the way that these censoring gets
incorporated here.

48
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,760
Is that right before seven months at that
time point,

49
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,540
there were actually only three people at
risk of dying.

50
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,550
You're not going to count subject A in the
denominator here because they

51
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,106
were censored.

52
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:43,578
So, we'll weigh that subject A is getting
incorporated here the way that we're,

53
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:45,500
how they in fact that they were censored.

54
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,510
Is that our denominator now is just 3
rather than 4.

55
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,390
So, we say that 2 out of 3 survived this
second interval from four to seven months.

56
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:59,260
The survival probability for this second
interval was 2 3rd, 2 out of 3.

57
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,560
And then, on say subject B and D,

58
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,160
survive all the way to the end of the
study period and the study ends.

59
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,970
So, we just draw the curve over we don't
have anything else happen.

60
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,470
Now the Kaplan-Meier curve gives us a
cumulative probability of survival.

61
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,658
So we have, we drop the curve down here
at, to 80%.

62
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:16,490
80% of the people were surviving.

63
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,930
Where did I drop the curve?

64
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,970
I didn't tell you yet where I dropped the
curve down here.

65
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,130
So what, where, what percent, what was my
chance of survival?

66
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,050
Where did I drop the curve down here?

67
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,290
I mean, to do that, we have to multiply
together the probability of

68
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,080
surviving the first interval, which was 4
5th.

69
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,710
You have to survive the first interval and

70
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,140
the second interval to get the cumulative
probability.

71
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,190
The probability of surviving the second
interval remember was 2 out of 3.

72
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,020
So, to get the cumulative probability of
surviving the past seven months,

73
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,630
we multiply 4 5th times 2 3rd, that's s
survival probability of 53%.

74
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,060
So, this curve is now at 53%.

75
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,110
So, our curve here is defined at just 2
times points when events occurred.

76
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,370
There was an 80% probability of surviving
past four months,

77
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,560
and a 53% probability of surviving past
seven months.

78
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,674
And through to the end of the study,

79
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:06,210
we just multiply those intervals together
assuming we have independence here to

80
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,950
get the total probability of surviving the
whole time.

81
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,319
Notice that this Kaplan-Meier estimate of
survival takes into account censoring.

82
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:20,600
The 53% that we've estimated the
probability of surviving

83
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,383
past the year is kind of a compromise
between two other possibilities.

84
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:26,440
We started the study with five people.

85
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,830
We know that two people died.

86
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,070
So, if you were not accounting for
censoring you could just say well there

87
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,980
was 3 out of 5 people who survived the
study.

88
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,590
So, maybe a rough guess at the survival
probability would be 60%.

89
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:46,640
On the other hand, you might look at it
with the sort of glass half empty.

90
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,530
And you might say, well you know,

91
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,660
actually I only know that two survived in
past the year.

92
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,300
I don't know what happened to the third
one.

93
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,640
So, I'm going to say that the survival
probability is only 40%.

94
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,580
And maybe it's a little higher than 40%,
but I might make a guess of 40%.

95
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,280
So, my bounds here is, I could either
estimate.

96
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,605
If I wasn't accounting for censoring, I
could either estimate the probability of

97
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:14,520
survival for a year to be 40%, because I
only say two survive the year.

98
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,410
Or I could estimate it to be 60% because I
only saw two die.

99
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,280
It's going to be somewhere in between
there.

100
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,240
So, notice that the 53% from the
Kaplan-Meier estimate is

101
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,081
a good compromise between those two.

102
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:33,380
Let me do go through a real example of
doing a Kaplan-Meier curve.

103
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,930
This is, we're going to just look at a
single curve for one group of women.

104
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,390
I'm going to make a happy route here.

105
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,240
Come here rather than death, we're going
to talk about time to conception for

106
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,020
people who are trying to get pregnant or
having trouble.

107
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,960
The failure therefore is a good thing, the
event is a good thing.

108
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,100
So there were 38 women who were treated
with infertility with a certain treatment.

109
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,480
And we are trying to track their time to
pregnancy.

110
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,770
All the women were followed for

111
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,290
up to two years to describe time to
conception and the event is conception.

112
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,890
So, we're starting with 100% of women not
being pregnant, [COUGH] and

113
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,060
women survive until they conceive.

114
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,310
As to the event here is conception is a,
is a positive outcome.

115
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,120
So, here's all the data.

116
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,490
It's a nice data set because it just
writes out all, we can see all the data.

117
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,780
These are the women who had the event.

118
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,566
These are the women who did not have the
event and this is the timing of it.

119
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:23,710
So, here's the Kaplan-Meier curve that
corresponds to these data.

120
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,258
And everywhere you see a little star,
that's just where a woman was censored.

121
00:06:26,258 --> 00:06:29,910
She dropped out of the study before she
became pregnant.

122
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,290
So, we start at a 100% and it drops down
from there.

123
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,620
Remember, we want the curve to drop here.

124
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,760
We want, when the woman are trying to get
pregnant,

125
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,560
the survival function is a step wise
function with nine event times.

126
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,350
There's nine unique steps on this curve
that defines the survival probabilities.

127
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,290
Again, we only find the survival
probabilities where we actually see event.

128
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,060
So, let me just show you walk through how
this is calculated.

129
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,400
Again, a computer will do this for you but

130
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,490
its nice to have some concept of what's
going on.

131
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,840
So, the first thing the first month and

132
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,430
women can only get pregnant once a month,
right?

133
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:04,520
So, the first month, the first cycle,
there were six women who conceived.

134
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,440
So, they all had events in the first
cycle.

135
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,120
So, we can represent them on the curve six
women conceived in

136
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,270
the first menstrual cycle.

137
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,939
Therefore, 32 out of 38 survived
pregnancy-free past the first month.

138
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:17,725
So, we drop the curve down here.

139
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:22,770
A the survival probability of not getting
pregnant is 84%, so

140
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,182
we dropped the curve down to 84%.

141
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:29,680
That's the survival probability of making
it past one moth without getting pregnant.

142
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,270
Second thing that happens is in the second
month, we had five women who conceived.

143
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,830
Now, there is one woman who was censored
after two months.

144
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,630
I'll just, I'm going to call her 2.1 so we
don't get confused.

145
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,690
So, there were,

146
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,590
I had written down that a woman conc, that
was censored at two months.

147
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,020
That means she made it through two months,

148
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,710
we know she didn't get pregnant the second
month.

149
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,590
So, her censoring is going to happen after
the second month.

150
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,360
How do I represent this on the curve?

151
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,650
Well, I'm going to drop down the curve.

152
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,820
Five women conceived in the second month.

153
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,870
What was the risk set?

154
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,600
How many women were at risk of conceiving
in the second month?

155
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,060
There were 32 women.

156
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,425
We started with 38, six got pregnant in
the first month, 32 are left.

157
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:10,009
Therefore, 27 out of 32.

158
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:14,390
About 84% again survived the second month
pregnancy free.

159
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,300
To get the cumulative probability of
survival,

160
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,960
we have to we have to multiply together
the probability of

161
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,300
surviving the first month times the
probability of surviving the second month.

162
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,130
We multiply those two probabilities
together.

163
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:28,360
I get a total probability, a cumulative
probability of surviving pregnancy free,

164
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,230
free, past the second month of 71%.

165
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,110
So, I dropped the curve down to 71%.

166
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,680
Next thing, in the third month, we have
three women who conceived.

167
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,360
One woman is censored in between the
second and the third month.

168
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,830
So, we have to she is not going to be
included in the risk set.

169
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,470
She was not at risk of getting pregnant in
the third month because she

170
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,190
was dropped out.

171
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,990
So, there were only 26 women who were at
risk of getting pregnant in month three.

172
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,630
Out of those, three got pregnant, 23 did
not.

173
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,380
So the survival probability is 23 out of
26 or 88.5%.

174
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,050
Again, we have to multiply that with the
other ones to get

175
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,140
the total probability of surviving past
three months pregnancy for eight week.

176
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,990
Drop our curve down now to 62.8% in the
fourth month.

177
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,850
We had one person who had censored at 1
3rd,

178
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,393
so the at the fourth month, our risk set
was down to 22 women.

179
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:19,768
3 get pregnant, 19 did no get pregnant.

180
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,510
We're going to do the same thing.

181
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,790
Now, our probability of is down to 54%,
and we can keep going with this.

182
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,690
You get the idea.

183
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:33,699
[COUGH] At six months, there risk set of
18 women.

184
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:39,060
So, 88.8% survived this next interval
pregnancy free.

185
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,772
We're going to drop the curve now down to
42.9%.

186
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:47,551
That's your probability of surviving past
six months, pregnancy free in this study.

187
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:49,514
And I got bored here and

188
00:09:49,514 --> 00:09:54,700
decided to just scroll ahead when you get
down to 13 months.

189
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,040
The probability now is down to 22%, and

190
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,820
I just want to point out what happens at
the end of a Kaplan-Meier curve.

191
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:07,210
So, at 13 months, the probability was 22%
that dropped rapidly down to 15%.

192
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,850
So, there was kind of a big drop off here
at 16 months.

193
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,000
But that drop just represents that there
were three women left in the study.

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,690
And one got pregnant, and you get a big
drop in the curve just from three women.

195
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,490
So, as you get to the end of Kaplan-Meier
curves,

196
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,781
you're often down to a very small number
of women.

197
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:25,480
We have to be little bit careful about
interpreting the end of

198
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,450
the Kaplan-Meier curve things getting
legally.

199
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,182
So, two women did not conceive.

200
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:33,000
The tail of that curve here represents
that there

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,800
are just two women who remain
pregnancy-free for the rest of the study.

202
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,502
And it's not a represental lock, it's only
two women.

203
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:45,100
So again, at the end of the study that the
last of them are going to 16 months.

204
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,080
And then, they are at that point,

205
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,640
there was only 3 women left, 2 didn't get
pregnant, 1 did.

206
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,980
So this is, you can imagine our estimates
are getting very wiggly.

207
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,662
There's a lot of uncertainty when you get
down to such small numbers.

208
00:10:57,662 --> 00:11:02,870
So, just keep that in mind with the end of
Kaplan-Meier curves.

209
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,520
Finally we can also compare Kaplan-Meier
curves between two or more groups.

210
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,910
And here's an example of two groups.

211
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,580
Researchers randomized 44 patients with
hepatitis to receive either a steroid or

212
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,300
no treatment.

213
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,790
And then, they compared the survival
curve.

214
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,090
And here's the raw data.

215
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,940
In this case, I've got two groups.

216
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,576
So, I'm indicating censoring with a little
red star.

217
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:25,980
So somebody who has a little red star
means that they were

218
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,960
censored at that time.

219
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,540
People who don't have the star had the
event at that time.

220
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,470
I'm not going to go through the drawing of
these two curves, but

221
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,510
it would be the same way that I just
showed you.

222
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,080
And here's the resulting Kaplan-Meier
curve.

223
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,950
So, the red is the control group, they're
dying off faster.

224
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,570
The outcome here is death, and the steroid
group is doing a lot better.

225
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,730
Are those two curves statistically
different?

226
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,110
That's one question we're going to want to
answer when we're comparing groups.

227
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,900
It's a little misleading to the eye.

228
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,052
Because if you look at these two curves,
you might think, oh well,

229
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:00,630
the two curves are converging at the end,
right?

230
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,751
The two curves seem to join back together
at the end.

231
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:05,389
There seems to be a big divergence, and
then they seem to, to come back in.

232
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:09,710
But remember at the end of a Kaplan-Meier
curve, there's a lot of,

233
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,460
there's very few people left.

234
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,000
And so, there's a lot of uncertainty if
you were to drag,

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,960
draw confidence in amongst those estimates
would be very wide.

236
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,390
So, at this little jump here,

237
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,530
this drop, this big drop you're seeing in
the steroid curve at the end.

238
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,360
That just represents there were only three
people left.

239
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,310
And one of them died and two of them
remained.

240
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,530
So, the survival probability,

241
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,660
you're multiplying the curve by 2 3rd
which is a big fraction.

242
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,220
You're, you're really dropping the curve
quite a bit here,

243
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,110
just due to one person dying.

244
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:43,960
Also, there's only just six people left in
the placebo control group.

245
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,410
That just happened to survive the rest of
the study.

246
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,710
So, that represents that long curve at the
end just represents six people.

247
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,215
So, you have to be a little careful about
over-interpreting the ends of

248
00:12:53,215 --> 00:12:54,260
Kaplan-Meier curves.

249
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,280
They can get pretty wiggly with such small
numbers.

250
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:02,040
So, I ran a log-rank test on these data in
a, a computer package.

251
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,530
Actually, doing the log-rank test by hand
is pretty tedious.

252
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,700
But a log-rank test compares those two
curves.

253
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,210
It compares them across all the time
points at once.

254
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,185
It's a chi-square test.

255
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:15,378
It's a chi-square test with one degree of
freedom.

256
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,877
Again, I'm not going to go into the exact
details of the test.

257
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:19,990
But it's a chi-square test with one degree
of freedom.

258
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,040
It did come out to be statistically
significant here.

259
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,550
Saying that the overall those time points
there is

260
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:33,081
a significant difference between the two
groups.
