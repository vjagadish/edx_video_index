1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,590
When we do statistics on binomials,

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,260
what we actually usually do are statistics
on proportions.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,830
So I just want to point that out now.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,340
We don't usually talk about, oh, I got 60
I found 60 smokers in my 200 cases.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,730
We don't usually talk about the number 60,

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,230
we talk that about the proportion that
that's 30% of my sample.

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,980
So our statistics are all going to be on
the proportions rather than the counts.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,690
So you'll just notice when we do
statistics on proportions,

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,420
it'll look a lot like the binomial.

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,425
But everything will differ by a factor of
n.

11
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:31,710
So, a statistic on a proportion, when I,

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,860
I represent that as a p-hat, that means a
sample proportion.

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,940
If I want to know, what's the mean and

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,600
standard deviation of a sample proportion,
those fall right out of the binomial.

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,360
The mean and variance for a binomial.

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,210
So the mean is just p.

17
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,300
That's, np for binomial, divide by n.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,340
Because a proportion divides by n, that's
the mean for a, proportion is p.

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,920
And similarly, the standard deviation for

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,830
the binomial is the square root of n times
p times 1 minus p.

21
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,695
If you divide that quantity by n, it turns
out to be this lower quantity.

22
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:03,830
And we're going to see this particular
formula a lot because that's the standard

23
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,820
error of a proportion.

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,680
So again, that formula is going to come
up, but

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,890
it falls right out of the binomial.

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,920
And, when we're doing statistics on
proportions,

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,010
we're actually usually calculating
z-scores.

28
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,440
We're actually pretending we're on a
normal as long as the original binomial,

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,240
the n times p, is greater than 5.

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,650
So most of those statistics on proportions
have that assumption embedded in

31
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,890
them that n times p is greater than 5.

32
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,424
If it turns out that you have a situation
where you have n times p is very, is much,

33
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,979
is less than 5, that often occurs if you
have a very small sample.

34
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,820
You need to instead go back to calculating
the exact binomial probabilities.

35
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,110
And those tests are, they are, just what
they sound like.

36
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,840
They are, they are named things like the
exact binomial test.

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,680
So we'll see some of those in the case
where you might have small numbers and

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,000
it's not appropriate to approximate with a
normal.
