1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,750
Welcome to week seven.

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,300
This week we're going to talk about how to
build prediction models.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,270
So last week we talked about the
distinction between Explanatory models and

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,740
predictive models.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,740
So, explanatory models are trying to
identify [UNKNOWN] relationships whereas

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,950
predictive models are trying to predict
something accurately about the future.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,020
Because those goals are very different,

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,740
the model building process is also
going to be different.

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,270
So, this week we are going to talk about
model selection and

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,410
evaluation in the context of predictive
models.

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,860
We'll be using some tools, the bootstrap,
cross-validation, and shrinkage.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,710
I just want to quickly point out one thing
to you,

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,910
last week when I was talking about
explanatory models,

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,920
I talked about the situation where we had
multiple important predictors.

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,350
We were trying to identify multiple
important predictors.

16
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,120
Of an outcome.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,740
And I'll just warn you that in some ways
this is going to look, kind of similar to

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,040
what we're doing this week when we're
trying to do prediction modeling,

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,160
because we will be trying to find a set of
predictors that significantly relate to

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,230
the outcome.

21
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,010
You've gotta keep in the back of your mind
though,

22
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,160
that these two problems are very, very
different.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,520
So when we're trying to identify multiple
important predictors, Of an outcome.

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,400
In the causal situation, in the
explanatory case,

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,760
we really care about confounding, because
we don't want to accidentally say that

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,040
a confounder is related to an outcome when
it's not.

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,790
And we really care about chance findings,

28
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,380
we don't want to say that something's
related, when it's not.

29
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,540
When we're talking about finding a set of
predictors for

30
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,570
a prediction model, remember our goal is
just to be able to predict accurately.

31
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,480
So, we're not going to worry so

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,210
much about confounding because if we put a
confounder in the model, It doesn't

33
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:55,130
matter, as long as it's just as predictive
as the variable that its related to.

34
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,700
Which it could be.

35
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,700
We may worry less about chance findings as
well because if we end up with a couple of

36
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,370
extra predictors in our prediction model
that are actually just noise.

37
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,250
It will reduce the, the model accuracy a
little bit.

38
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,880
But we're not so worried about getting one
or two wrong.

39
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,640
Because again we're not making any causal
claims about those variables.

40
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,290
So just keep in mind that even know these,
these may seem the same they're,

41
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,560
they're actually quite different.

42
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,200
Now prediction is everywhere.

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,450
So if you pay attention to the news You'll
notice prediction in, in tons of

44
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,690
news stories because everybody wants to
forecast something about the future.

45
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,950
So here's a couple of recent headlines I
happen to see, so

46
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,102
Warren Buffet is offering a billion
dollars if you can get the perfect NCAA

47
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:44,700
(no period) Tournament bracket to the NCAA
basketball tournament that gets

48
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,400
played every year where you start with 64
teams and you get down to one winner and

49
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,990
a lot of people will bet on this, he is
offering a billion dollars if you can get

50
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,550
it exactly right, now in a minute, I'll
show you what the probability of that is.

51
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,470
Is.

52
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,030
But that's a prediction problem.

53
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,930
And then Nate Silver is often in the news
for prediction.

54
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:08,260
He of course, accurately predicted the
presidential elections in 2008 and 2012.

55
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,110
He's also predicting things like Oscars
and the Super Bowl apparently.

56
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,700
Prediction was in the news recently also
because people are trying

57
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,700
predict risks of earthquakes.

58
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,020
That's of course very important in the Bay
Area.

59
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,060
So there's so many cases where prediction
comes in.

60
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,420
Just for fun here I want to actually
calculate what's the probability of

61
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,370
winning that billion dollar prize from
Warren Buffet,

62
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,200
we can calculate the probability of that.

63
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,100
So how does the basketball tournament
work?

64
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,770
So, we start with 64 basketball teams.

65
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,360
They are going to play two at a time,

66
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,170
so, they'll be 32 games, from which will
emerge 32 winners.

67
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,250
So we'll know at the beginning of the day
the 64 teams that will start, and

68
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,349
we'll know who's playing who.

69
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,290
After that, we'll get, have 32 teams left.

70
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,950
Those teams will each play each other.

71
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,420
So we'll have a winner and a loser from
each of those games.

72
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,970
We'll get down to 16 teams, and then down
to eight.

73
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,640
Then down to four.

74
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,240
Then down to the final game, and then down
to the winner.

75
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,320
Okay.

76
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,730
So, we can, its actually not too hard to
go through and

77
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,180
say, what's the probability of getting
the, the perfect bracket.

78
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,560
So we have to calculate first of all what
are all the possible brackets that we

79
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,860
could possibly choose if we're in our
office pool for example.

80
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,590
So, the first thing that happens is we
have 64 teams.

81
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,940
We know who's playing each other within
that 64.

82
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,569
Out of that 32 winners.

83
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,260
Well, the pr, the number of different ways
we

84
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,110
can get 32 winners out of those 32 games,
is 2 raised to the 32.

85
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,920
That's because in each game, there are two
possible winners, and there are 32 games.

86
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,550
So we do 2 raised to the 32nd.

87
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,590
So, that's the first step.

88
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,500
That's just to get the first through the
first round of elimination.

89
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,650
Then, we get to this second set, so 32
teams are left.

90
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,440
There is going to be 16 games, two at a
time.

91
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,620
And now, again, we are going to have out
of that two raised to

92
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,560
the 16 ways that those games could sort
themselves out, right?

93
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,350
You could have In, with each game there's
two possible winners,

94
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,100
there's 16 different games.

95
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,720
Well now we can keep going, you can
kind of guess the pattern here.

96
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,050
So, the, the next round, there's going to
be eight winners, so there's two

97
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,940
possible winners for every game, there can
only going to be eight winners.

98
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,030
And then the next round is going to be 2
to the 4,

99
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,580
the next round is going to be 2 to the 2
and

100
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,360
the next round there's going to be only 1
winner out of 2 teams left.

101
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,440
So we just can multiply together all these
2's raised to different powers (no period)

102
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,440
And so, if you just add up the 32 plus the
16, plus the 8, 4, 2, and 1.

103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,750
You can see this is raised to, this is 2
raised to the 63rd.

104
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,570
There are to raised to the 63rd ways that
you could draw [UNKNOWN] bracket.

105
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,180
That many possibilities.

106
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,035
Well, 2 raised to the 63rd.

107
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:53,460
[INAUDIBLE] base 2 is not so big.

108
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,460
You might not thing this is huge.

109
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:02,220
But actually, what value is, is this is 9,
quintillion, which means 18 zeros.

110
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,185
So, let's see, one, two, three, four,
five, six.

111
00:06:04,185 --> 00:06:09,590
[SOUND] I just have to draw it out
because,

112
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,130
just to show you how big that number is.

113
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,730
So, that's 9 quintillion, there are 9
quintillion possible records.

114
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,880
Of course, the probability of winning the
billion dollar prize.

115
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,660
Now this is just if you're guessing, is 1
out of 9 quintillion.

116
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,210
Okay.
So, it's not likely,

117
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,480
that anybody is actually going to claim
this price as Warren Buffett said

118
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,190
billion dollar is pretty safe.

119
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,430
Now of course if you had actual knowledge
about basketball,

120
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,650
you could do much better than these odds.

121
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,570
Because you'd have some sense of who's
likely to win each game, but

122
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,010
still, even in that case the probability
is going to be really, really,

123
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,220
really low that you can get it exactly
right.

124
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,050
It's Oscar time until there's been a lot
of Oscar predictions going on

125
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:52,620
around in the,

126
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,770
in the news, this was some predictions
that were made from the 2013 Oscar's.

127
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,110
Somebody came up with some kind of
modeling And

128
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,010
predicted out of all of the nominees who
was going to win in each category.

129
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,440
There were 24 categories.This person got I
think it was 19 out of

130
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,540
24 correct which isn't bad.

131
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,020
Then you can see some of there results
here so for best director, they

132
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,630
calculated that the highest probability of
winning went to Steven Spielberg.

133
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,510
In fact, Life of Pi Director Ang Lee won.

134
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,510
So he got this one wrong, but then you can
see he got a lot right,

135
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,890
everywhere it's yellow he got it right.

136
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:30,790
So Argo he gave a 68% chance, indeed Argo
won, Life of Pi for

137
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:37,230
best cinematography he gave 95% chance and
that won, best actor, best screenplay etc.

138
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,300
So you can see that there's a lot of
things that people want to predict and

139
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,510
it's a lot of fun to do prediction.
