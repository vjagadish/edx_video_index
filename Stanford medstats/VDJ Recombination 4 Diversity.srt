2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:13,810
This is the day new mom of our series of
lectures on VDJ recombination.

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,830
Because that whole process of VDJ
recombination culminates in

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,910
the formation of an antibody molecule.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,632
And I've drawn for you up here an antibody
molecule.

6
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:28,430
And the antibody molecule consists of two
identical heavy chains and

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,653
the two identical heavy chains are heavy
chains because they're bigger.

8
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:37,450
And I'll show you the heavy chains, little
arrows.

9
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:44,810
There's one here and there's one there and
two identical light chains.

10
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:53,847
And they're are two identical light
chains,

11
00:00:53,847 --> 00:01:00,110
one over here and one over here.

12
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,240
Okay.
And each of those chains, light chain and

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,890
heavy chain, have in them a variable
region.

14
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,080
And the variable region has been drawn in
black.

15
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:16,010
So the variable regions are in black.

16
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,090
Right?
Variable regions.

17
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:21,950
And the colors.

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,240
Let's draw a red and blue arrow.

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,600
Red and blue arrow correspond to constant
regions.

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,850
The red to the constant region of the
heavy chain and

21
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,790
the blue to the constant region of the
light chain.

22
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,898
Okay.
So, these antibodies can

23
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:46,940
have incredible variation.

24
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,870
In fact, the variation is ab, absolutely
mind boggling.

25
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,230
And because these antibodies have to
recognize all kinds of foreign antigens.

26
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,660
And I'm going to show you exactly how we
get to such huge

27
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,327
numbers using VDJ recombinations.

28
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,550
It turns out that we mentioned that there
was a heavy chain gene.

29
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,000
And I'm going to draw for you the heavy
chain gene.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,620
Okay.
So here's a single heavy chain gene.

31
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,780
And it's the germ line heavy chain gene.

32
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,420
All right.
There's the germ line heavy chain gene

33
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,520
all the way across there.

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,390
There's the long germ line heavy chain
gene.

35
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,808
And let me just say, germ line,

36
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:35,700
heavy chain gene.

37
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,570
So, the antibody's a protein, but

38
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,560
now we've got a gene, germ line heavy
chain gene.

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,450
And the germ line heavy chain gene
consists of a number of variable regions.

40
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:53,570
I'm going to draw a few of them, dot, dot,
dot.

41
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,070
Okay.

42
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,000
And in the human, it turns out, every
animal is somewhat different, but

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,460
in the human there are roughly 50 variable
regions.

44
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,920
Okay?
In addition to that, we don't string.

45
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,580
Let's put a stagger mark down there.

46
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,450
There are a number of D regions and, I'm
going to

47
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,720
draw a few of them, dot, dot, dot.

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,110
And so there are a number of D regions,

49
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,320
and in fact, there are about 25 D regions
in the human.

50
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,849
D1, D2, and D25.

51
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:36,526
Okay?

52
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:41,480
So, downstream of that there are a number
of J regions.

53
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:51,956
And in the humans, there are six J
regions.

54
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:55,150
[BLANK_AUDIO]

55
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,130
Dot, dot, dot six J regions.

56
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,341
[BLANK_AUDIO]

57
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:02,841
Hm.

58
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,719
Okay.
J1, J2 and J6.

59
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,540
Okay.

60
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,260
So all of these are a little bit
different.

61
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:22,360
So, I'm going to make them a little bit
different.

62
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,100
All right.
So there's the heavy

63
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,819
chain gene, right up here.

64
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,210
And as we described before, VDJ
recombination picks one of the V regions,

65
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:34,150
one of the D regions, and one of the J
regions, and brings them together.

66
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,400
All right?

67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,720
So there's a tremendous amount of
diversity,

68
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,710
that's produced, from this recombination
event.

69
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,060
Now, downstream from the J region.

70
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,930
I'm out of space, so I'm just going to
curl it around.

71
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:56,500
I'm going to draw a block corresponding to
the constant region of the heavy chain,

72
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,840
and of course, because, if anybody has it
in red, I'll also draw a red here.

73
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,510
So, this is the constant region for the
heavy chain.

74
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,600
All right.

75
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:19,190
And notice that I've drawn the V, the D
and the J all in black,

76
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,480
because they're going to end up

77
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,730
encoding the variable region of the heavy
chain, which is up here.

78
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,740
So how many different variable regions can
we

79
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,725
get out of this single heavy chain gene?

80
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:40,130
Well, for any one of the J regions, you
can have 25 different D regions.

81
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,830
But there are six J regions.

82
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,970
Each of which can go with 25 D regions.

83
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,180
So the number of D to J combinations.

84
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,750
Let me draw it in black to emphasize.

85
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,260
Gotta get the colors [SOUND].

86
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,820
You can get 25 times 6, D to J
combinations.

87
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,384
But each of these D to J combinations can
go with any one of 50 V regions.

88
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:21,180
So, you can get a total of 50 times 25
times 6.

89
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,230
Recombinant from V, D, and J.

90
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:33,030
So 50 times 25 times 6 is equal to 7500,
7500.

91
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,320
So from one gene you

92
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,420
can get 7500 different heavy chains, just
by combinatorics.

93
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,640
All right.

94
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,130
But that's not all because remember, there
are light chain genes.

95
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,300
And so there are two kinds of light chain
genes.

96
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,520
There is a Kappa light chain gene and a
Lambda light chain gene.

97
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,240
So the germ line Kappa light chain gene.

98
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:15,700
Kappa light chain looks like this.

99
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,890
It has a number of V regions and a number
of J regions upstream of a constant

100
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,950
region, so we're going to make that blue.

101
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,130
All right.

102
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,980
And so we have a number of V regions
[SOUND] in

103
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:43,409
the Kappa light chain, dot, dot, dot.

104
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:54,850
V1, V2 and in the Kappa Light Chain in
humans anyway there are about 40 of these.

105
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,460
And then downstream of them there are some
J regions and

106
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,039
the J regions look like so, dot, dot, dot.

107
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,950
And there are five J regions, J1, J2 and
J5.

108
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,710
So, how many recombinant can we get from
the Kappa light chain for

109
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,370
each one of the J regions?

110
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,690
We can have 40 V regions.

111
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,780
So, there are a total of 40 times 5 but
there is also a lambda light chain.

112
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,510
Now, it's interesting,

113
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,250
the lambda light chain [SOUND]

114
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:37,430
looks a little bit different and actually
if you go to the chapter

115
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:44,720
on gene duplication at the beginning of
the very origins of the VDJ recombination.

116
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,320
You can imagine that the duplication could
have occurred in a way to

117
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,890
produce the lambda light chain.

118
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,330
It's just a little bit of a different
pattern of duplication.

119
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,240
So, the way the duplication happened was
for

120
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,790
the lambda light chain dot, dot, dot.

121
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:12,121
There are a total of also, about 40 V
regions.

122
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:12,783
Okay?

123
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:15,470
[BLANK_AUDIO]

124
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,190
And then there are four J segments, each
of which,

125
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,720
is upstream of its own constant region.

126
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,400
So the, gene duplication that occurred is,
looks like this.

127
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,700
So here's one J region.

128
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,200
Upstream of its own constant region, I'm
going to draw a different kind of

129
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,760
constant region because this is now the
lambda light chain.

130
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:47,970
And then, there's another J region and
dot, dot, dot.

131
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,850
Let's just, save some time here.

132
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,320
Another J region.

133
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:59,146
And there's a total of four of

134
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:03,460
these, so, J4, upstream of its own
constant region.

135
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,060
So as a result of this, we have a total
for the Kappa light chain,

136
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,440
we have a total of 40 times 5
possibilities.

137
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,760
For the lambda light chain we have a total
of 40 times 4 possibilities.

138
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,850
So, the total number of different ways you
can have light chains.

139
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,830
Is 40 times 5 plus the number of ways you
can have lam,

140
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,860
that's the number of ways you can have
kappa light

141
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,760
chains plus the number of ways you can
have lambda light chains.

142
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,940
So this is kappa, kappa, and the number of
ways you can have lambda light chains,

143
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,220
which would be 40 times 4.

144
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,422
That's lambda.

145
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:50,407
Okay?

146
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:56,056
And that equals 200 plus 160, that equals
360.

147
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,896
[BLANK_AUDIO]

148
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:04,980
So, every antibody has to have two
identical heavy chains and

149
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,780
two identical light chains.

150
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,610
There are a total of 7,500 different
combinations that

151
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,980
can produce a heavy chain.

152
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,470
And a total of 360 different ways you can
produce a light chain.

153
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:26,737
The germ, the germ line heavy changing
undergoes VDJ recombination.

154
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:31,060
[BLANK_AUDIO]

155
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,700
And the light chains undergo VJ
recombination.

156
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,668
That's why, the D is in parenthesis.

157
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:42,650
Because heavy chain does the D,

158
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,870
and light chains only do V and J.

159
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,133
So the total number of combinations of
heavy chain and

160
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:54,875
light chain is 7,500 times 360.

161
00:11:54,875 --> 00:12:03,518
7,500 times 360 and

162
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:09,050
that equals 2,700,000, a truly staggering
number.

163
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,270
So just by combinatorics, three measly
little genes,

164
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:19,240
one germ line heavy chain gene and two
different light chains, Kappa and Lambda.

165
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,390
Three genes can produce two, 2,700,000
different combinations.

166
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:29,280
That gives you incredible diversity in,
encoding for antibodies.

167
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,930
And as a result of that,

168
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,840
we can fight off infections from bugs that
we haven't even seen before.

169
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,830
Because we have that many different ways
of making antibodies.

170
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:47,590
Now contrast this to another strategy,
which would be to make a separate gene for

171
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,870
every different antibody that you could
make.

172
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,730
You'd have to make 2,700,000 different
genes.

173
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,360
Well, it turns out our genome really
doesn't have enough room for

174
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,610
that, because the human genome contains
only about 20,000 genes.

175
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,610
So there's no way you could have an immune
system with this kind of diversity if

176
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:11,260
you didn't use the combinatorics that are
involved in VDJ combination.

177
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,330
So you've got 2,700,000 ways to make
anti-bodies out of three genes.

178
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:21,440
And so you're only using up three of your
20,000 genes to make antibodies.

179
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,325
Pretty amazing.

180
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:25,229
Thank you.
