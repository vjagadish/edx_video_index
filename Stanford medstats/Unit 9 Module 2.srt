1
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,550
In this next module, I'm going to walk
through a real example just to

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,830
practice how to interpret the results of
logistic regression.

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,460
So I'm going to use a real example from
the medical literature.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,470
This was a case control study that was
done,

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,610
the physicians who graduated from medical
school at UCSF.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,230
What they were looking for, the outcome
they were interested in was being

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,330
disciplined by the Medical Board of
California.

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,760
So if a physician gets disciplined by the
medical board,

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,267
that's a pretty bad thing, so those are
the cases.

10
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:45,125
They identified 68 physicians who have a
disciplinary action between 1990 and

11
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,700
2000, who had graduated from UCSF.

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,415
Those are the cases in our outcome
variable here is that

13
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:53,230
disiplining from the Medical Board of
California.

14
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,040
It's a case control study so the
researchers found those people who

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,480
had been disciplined, you know it's fairly
rare.

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,000
So they zoned in on them by picking those
in particular.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,055
Then they found controls, the controls
were graduates,

18
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:10,860
196 controls, who were matched by medical
school graduation year.

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,360
So they were the same graduating class,
and specialty choice.

20
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,010
So each, for each case, the, they went out
and

21
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,090
found a couple of controls who came from
the same graduating class.

22
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,190
And were from the same specialty choice.

23
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:29,829
The aim of the study, I'm just quoting
from the paper here, was, to determine

24
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:34,010
if medical students who demonstrate
unprofessional behavior in medical school.

25
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,800
Are more likely to have subsequent state
board disciplinary action.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,880
So they were going back into the records
of these graduates and trying to

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,980
determine if there were things that could
predict subsequent disciplinary action.

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,980
By the medical board in particular.

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,140
They wanted to see if there was some
unprofessional behavior in medical school

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,690
that could flag those who were at risk of
this outcome.

31
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,350
It's a binary outcome, you're either
disciplined or you weren't.

32
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,220
What kind of analysis are we going to
analyze?

33
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,260
We are going to use to analyze these data.

34
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,730
If you look at our little chart here,
we've got a binary outcome.

35
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,330
We were disciplined by the Medical Board
of California or not.

36
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,520
It's a case control study so the outcome
is case or control.

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,335
We want to do some kind of regression
analysis because it's

38
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:22,810
an observational study , we want to be
able to control for confounder.

39
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,460
That might lead you to think, oh, I should
pick logistic regression.

40
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,240
And in fact, the authors of this study did
indeed use just

41
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,319
a plain old logistic regression analysis.

42
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,020
I want to just point out here though, if
you look closely at this study,

43
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,770
the observations are not independent, they
are correlated.

44
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,910
This was a matched case control study.

45
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,864
Each case was matched to a couple of
control.

46
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:50,650
So actually we should be using here the
logistic regression for

47
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,540
correlated data which is something called
conditional logistic regression.

48
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,270
That counts for the correlation.

49
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,560
So that's actually the proper statisical
technique that should've been used here.

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,580
It would still give odds ratios, and in
this case,

51
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,800
I'm not sure it would have made a huge
difference to the results of this study.

52
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
But it's correlated data, so

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,915
that would have actually been the
appropriate statistical test to use.

54
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:16,350
What's the consequence here that the
authors used

55
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,670
logistic regression instead of conditional
logistic regression.

56
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,114
We have a situation where were are
comparing within groups.

57
00:03:23,114 --> 00:03:26,750
Remember when we were talking about
correlated data, I told you that if you

58
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,330
ignore the correlation when you're doing a
within group comparison.

59
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,500
That your peer leaders are going to be too
high.

60
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:39,300
That means you might miss in effect by not
analyzing the data correctly.

61
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,525
So here what you should do is compare each
case to their matched control.

62
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:47,930
cases, those case control groups are more
similar to

63
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,530
each other than to other people in the
study.

64
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,470
If you account for that correlation, you
actually would've gotten

65
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,020
probably here a little bit better P values
than what the authors got.

66
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,800
So their analysis could be described as a
little conservative.

67
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,260
Anything that came out significant, we're
pretty sure that's real.

68
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,390
But it could have been that those P values
could have come out more significant in

69
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,940
some of the things that didn't come out
significant.

70
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,940
In the correct analysis might have, so

71
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,710
this is a conservative analysis by
ignoring that correlation.

72
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,600
I just want to point that out to

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,210
remind you the importance of thinking
about correlation.

74
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:23,915
In any case, the author's used a regular
old logistic regression, and

75
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:26,710
again, these results might be a little
conservative.

76
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,380
We might have missed something here as a
result.

77
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,740
But we can look at the odds ratios, that
logistic regression model, and

78
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,130
just, I want to walk you through how you'd
interpret this table.

79
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,040
So this is Table 5,

80
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,560
from the paper, this is the results of the
logistics regression analysis.

81
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,200
Notice that they're not presenting any
betas, they're just simply going right for

82
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,020
the odds ratios.

83
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,420
They're not presenting any intercepts, we
don't need all of that for

84
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,900
this particular example.

85
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,880
We only care about the odds ratios.

86
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,090
So, just they're just presenting directly
the odds ratios,

87
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,320
the confidence intervals for those odds
ratios, and the P values.

88
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,470
I know want to walk you through what each
of these odds ratios means,

89
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,500
how do we interpret it?

90
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,380
So the first predictor you'll notice here
is male gender.

91
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,530
So the Odds Ratio here is 1.51.

92
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,640
Now this is a fairly rare outcome.

93
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,540
So we can interpret the odds ratios like
risk ratios and

94
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,890
there's not going to be much distortion in
the effect here.

95
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,380
So the odds ratio is 1.51 for males.

96
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,590
It's not statistically significant so

97
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,980
we're not sure that it's any different
than one.

98
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,120
We would say that there's a 50 percent
increase in the odds of the disciplinary

99
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,520
action for men versus women, but it's not
statistically significant.

100
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,270
So this model includes all the things that
you see in the table.

101
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,690
So once you adjust for all of these other
factors the effect of male,

102
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,820
of being male is not statistically
signifigant.

103
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,370
The next variable is, Undergraduate GPA.

104
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:57,290
This is a continuous predictor, it ranges
from 0 to 4.0.

105
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,770
So the way that, you interpret this odds
ratio.

106
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,537
First of all, we notice that
undergraduate, GPA is protective.

107
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:10,030
So as your GPA goes up a whole unit, so
this is for

108
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,880
a 1 unit increase in GPA, that's pretty
big.

109
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,320
That's like going from 3 to 4, 2 to 3.

110
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,190
A one unit jump in your GPA, will decrease
your odds of

111
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,110
disciplinary action by 43%, but it's also
not statistically significant.

112
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,050
So once you've accounted for all the other
things, all the other variables that

113
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,040
you see in this table the effect of
undergraduate GPA is not significant.

114
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,210
It doesn't appear to be an independent
predictor.

115
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,320
Although it trends in the direction of
being protective here.

116
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,740
Interestingly the MCAT score, so the way
they measure MCAT score here.

117
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,570
It's this is comparing those who are in
the lowest quartile of MCAT score to

118
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,180
those who are in the higher 3 quartiles,
so this is a binary variable here.

119
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,410
If you're in the lowest quartile compared
to the others, your odds ratio was 1.01.

120
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,310
So after counting for

121
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,540
all these other things in the table,
there's really no effective MCAT score.

122
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,700
Interestingly enough, MCAT score was not
an independent predictor at all here.

123
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,910
The P value you can see is, you know,
very, very high.

124
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,130
If you another binary variable, if you did
not pass, if you failed,

125
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,570
in other words if you failed, any of your
courses in medical school.

126
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,858
Your odds ratio was 1.30, so

127
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:20,170
a 30% increase in your odds of
disciplinary action, although again,

128
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:24,800
that's clearly not statistically
significant, so that's very close to 1.

129
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,420
Not an independent predictor, but in the
direction of increasing your risk.

130
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:35,650
Finally, if you had, displayed
unprofessional behavior in medical school.

131
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,209
Severe enough to meet, this, their
criteria here that they,

132
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,690
you had displayed this unprofessional
behavior in medical school.

133
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,740
Which they think might be a flag for later
disciplinary action.

134
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,130
This is the only significant predictor
after adjusting for

135
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:51,960
everything else in the model.

136
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,630
So that doubled your odds of getting
disciplinary action.

137
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,850
And in this case, because the outcome is
fairly rare, if you said it

138
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,860
doubled your risk of having disciplinary
action, that would actually be very close.

139
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,290
So that was the only independent predictor
after adjusting for

140
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:12,114
everything else in the model.
