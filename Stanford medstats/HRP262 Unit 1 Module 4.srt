1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,650
In this next module I'm going to show you
how to compare Kaplan-Meier curves from

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,160
different groups.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,830
So to illustrate the points in this module
I'm going to use some example data,

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,475
which is comparing two groups.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:22,560
Kaplan-Meier statistics can be used to
compare multiple groups three,

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,670
four, whatever.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,810
But we'll keep it simple by just focusing
on a two-group example.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,720
So these are some real data that come from
a randomized trial,

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,150
researchers randomized 44 patients with
chronic active hepatitis to a kind of

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,200
steroid, or to no treatment or control.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,310
And then, were going to compare the
survival curves here.

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,940
So let me just show you what the data
actually look like here, So

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,190
the data are similar to before,

14
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,890
we have this kind of two part outcome
variable where we have time.

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,760
Which is either the time to sensoring or
the time to the event.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,340
And the event here is death, and, then we
have an event variable, that's

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,780
the binary variable that tells you one,
they died, or zero, they were censored.

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,160
We also have a variable that captures
whether or not they were in

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,810
the treatment group, so we have a treated
group and a control group here.

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,030
So this is just showing you the data in a
slightly different way.

21
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,440
The two columns represent the two
treatment groups,

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,030
and this is a little different than how I
showed you the pregnancy data.

23
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:25,020
The starred values are people who were
censored, and if you don't have a star,

24
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,330
that means you had the event that you die.

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,480
So that's just another way to represent
the data.

26
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,090
Let me show you what these look like when
we put them on a Kaplan-Meier curve.

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,840
So now we have two groups.

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,410
The red group represents the control
group.

29
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,410
The black line represents the treated
group.

30
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,520
And, as you can see, the open, here, is
death.

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,520
So you can see, you clearly want to be in
the treatment group, right.

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,370
The control group falls off pretty
quickly.

33
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,680
The treatment group seems to do much
better.

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,820
Now, be a little careful, when looking at
these curves, your might,

35
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,310
your eye might kind of go to the, end of
this curves and

36
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,340
you might say, well, it looks like they
kind of come together, eventually.

37
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,600
Time is in months, by the way.

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,660
You know, at the end of about 175 months,

39
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,050
it looks like the curves, converge, or
something.

40
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,300
But be very careful.

41
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,970
There's very, very few subjects left here.

42
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,350
And this probably doesn't represent a
whole heck of a lot.

43
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,540
A little bit misleading.

44
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,510
So we want to know whether or not these
two curves are statistically different.

45
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,510
We're going to, I'm going to show you some
tasks to look at that in a minute.

46
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,330
But again I just want to

47
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,510
point out that the end of this curve's a
little misleading to the eye.

48
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,200
So, there's six controls in the control
group who just kind of are censored, or

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,580
live until the end of the study.

50
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,940
You can see these little Ls here are
censored people.

51
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,770
There are only six controls left here at
about 70 months into the study.

52
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,450
So, these last six because none of them
died, it drags the curve all the way out.

53
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,740
But that's just due to six people, maybe
there are some people who can live with

54
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,930
chronic hepatitis, but that's why that
curve gets dragged all the way out.

55
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,450
And also there's this large drop in the
treatment curve at about 160 months.

56
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,010
And what's happening here,

57
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,660
is there's actually only three people left
in the treatment group at that time point.

58
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,670
When one person dies out of that three,
the curve drops like two thirds.

59
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,260
That's a big drop in the curve.

60
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,880
So, it also makes the curve look like it's
closer to the control curve.

61
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,730
But again, don't over interpret that.

62
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,710
Small sample sizes at the end of the
curves will often cause them to

63
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,539
move around like that.

64
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,956
So now lets look at, are these two curves
statistically different?

65
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:28,532
There are p-value tests that we can use to
evaluate the null hypothesis for

66
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:31,580
these tests would be that the two curves
are the same.

67
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,210
If we get a significant p-value that would
say we would reject a null hypothesis,

68
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,040
and conclude that they are significantly
different.

69
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,042
So that the test that,

70
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:42,750
main test that we are focusing on in
something called the log rank test.

71
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,920
You can see the results of the log rank
test here.

72
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,470
The p-value indeed comes out to be
statistically significant of pf 0.03.

73
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:54,050
So that would say that the two curves are
significantly different.

74
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,038
The log rate test is a chi-square
statistic.

75
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:58,750
It's a chi-square with one degree of
freedom.

76
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,880
And I'll, so

77
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,850
I'll show you in a minute that it's
actually a Mantel-Haenszel chi-square.

78
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,570
But this is one of the tests that you can
use,

79
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,730
the most commonly used to compare survival
curves.

80
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,570
And then again it could be used for more
than two groups.

81
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,960
So what is the Log-rank test actually?

82
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,930
I'm going to kind of walk you through the
math.

83
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,060
It's not something that you'd probably do
by hand, but

84
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,968
it's good to have an understanding of
what's going on behind the scenes.

85
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,870
So the Log-Rank test turns out to just be

86
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,170
a Mantel-Haenszel chi square test of
independence.

87
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:30,140
And we talked about the Mantel-Haenszel
test earlier when we talked about

88
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,890
stratifying for confounding.

89
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,500
So we used the Mantel-Haenszel chi square
test To stratify on confounders to

90
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,360
see whether or not an exposure and

91
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,250
an outcome were related after adjusting
for confounding.

92
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,290
The idea is similar here, except rather
than stratifying on a confounder we're

93
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,470
going to stratify on event times.

94
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,300
At every time when events cur, occur, when
people died.

95
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,390
We're going to be comparing the treated
and

96
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,760
control group at each one of those event
times.

97
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,180
The event times here are the strata.

98
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,580
So, again, the Log-rank test looks just
like the Mantel-Haenszel test statistic.

99
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,040
In this case the strata are the unique
event times.

100
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,610
And every month where people died in this
study,

101
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,229
that is an event time we're going make a
two by two table.

102
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,090
So there are K Strata K unique event
times,

103
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,680
and each event time in each one of these
strata we're going to look at

104
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,550
how many people were at risk at that event
time.

105
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,930
And we're going to compare the number of
events occurring in one group

106
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,000
versus the other.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,950
Treated versus control in the case of our
example data.

108
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,722
This just makes a simple two by two table
at every event time.

109
00:05:35,722 --> 00:05:39,900
The Mantel-Haenszel statistic, or the
Log-rank statistic here is just,

110
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,240
we're going to take the observed value of
a in every strata, and

111
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,010
we're going to compare it to the expected
value of a in the strata.

112
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,360
Now this is a two by two table that has
only one degree of freedom.

113
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,820
I could have chosen to peg this statistic
on b or c or d.

114
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,300
A is usually the most interesting cell, so
I've just chosen to focus on A.

115
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,700
But because the table only has one degree
of freedom,

116
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,160
I get the same value whether I focus on,
which ever cell I focused.

117
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,780
So, the, this is the observed value, we
take the observed value of cell a.

118
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,140
To calculate the expected value of cell a,

119
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,410
we're going to calculate that in the
normal way would would for

120
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:19,900
any chi squared statistic So, if group and
events are independent,

121
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,930
the probability of being in cell a would
just be a plus c times a plus b.

122
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,400
In other words, the row total times the
column total to get the expected value,

123
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,640
then we'd divide by n.

124
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,230
So row total times column total divided by
n gives us the expected value for

125
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,720
this cell.

126
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,120
For all of the strata, we are going to
take observed minus expected,

127
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,050
we are going to sum that up over all the
strata, that's the summation there, and

128
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,130
then we are going to square the whole
thing.

129
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,900
In the denominator, we are going to sum up
the variance of a for every strata.

130
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,094
The variance formula is the row, row one
times row two,

131
00:06:52,094 --> 00:06:57,650
times column times column two, divided by
the sample size in that stratum.

132
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,870
And squared times N minus one.

133
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,930
Now this is a little bit of a complicated
formula,

134
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,780
I'm not expecting you to calculate this by
hand.

135
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,470
Just realize that we the reason that's the
variances that were

136
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,690
working on a hyper-geometric distribution,

137
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,670
that's the variance of a hyper-geometric
distribution.

138
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,210
That's what a follows.

139
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,800
But that will be the variance for a give
a, and then we add,

140
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,319
of all the variances, over all the
different strata, that's our denominator.

141
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,730
Again, this is identical to the
Mantle-Haenszel statistic for

142
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,110
stratified unconfounders.

143
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,570
Now, a couple notes about this.

144
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,410
So first of all,

145
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,950
how do you know that this is a chi-square
statistic with one degree of freedom?

146
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,500
How do you know that this complicated
formula follows a chi-square?

147
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,770
Well, we can do a little bit of algebraic
rearrangement and

148
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:46,280
show that this statistic, what you see
here, is just the same as saying,

149
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,970
I want to add up all the different
observed a's over different,

150
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,340
all the different strata, so it's the sum
of observed a's.

151
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,540
We can rearrange that expected value as
well.

152
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,480
And show you that this is,

153
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,450
we are subtracted the expected value of
the sum of ace.

154
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,740
So that's equivalent.

155
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,230
We'd be then squaring all of that in the
numerator, so

156
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:12,070
it's something minus it's expected value,
and observed, minus it's expected value,

157
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,070
and then in the denominator, we have the
variants of that same thing again.

158
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,480
We can do a little bit of re-arrangement
that,

159
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,890
that is just equal to the variants of the
sum of a case.

160
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,450
We have got an observed, minus an expected
squared, divided by it's variants,

161
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,480
that's going to follow a chi-square with
one degree of freedom.

162
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,080
Or if you took the square root, you would
see that it's an observed minus

163
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,380
an expected divided by it's standard
deviation that follows a z squared.

164
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,380
Sorry a z sta, statistic if you take away
the square root.

165
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,420
So that, that's why this is a chi-square I
have written that out if

166
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,530
you can't read my handwriting.

167
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,030
I have written that out again there, and
again the variants formula just comes from

168
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,770
the fact that it's a hypergeometric
distribution.

169
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,574
So just a little bit of mathematical
background there.

170
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,880
Let's now actually show how to apply this
for real data.

171
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,010
So, going back to our hepatitis randomized
trial.

172
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,260
I'm displaying now some output from my
computer,

173
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,020
that summarizes all the different events
in the control group.

174
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,350
It also gives me the numbers at risk which
makes it easy because it's been

175
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,100
tabulated for me.

176
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,520
So if we look in the control group, this
is showing me the times, and

177
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,710
it's showing me when events occurred.

178
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,732
So, at the first time point,

179
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:24,700
with zero time zero, of course nobody has
had the event then.

180
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,820
The first event occurred at month two,

181
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,050
the first time we update the survival
estimate.

182
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,590
In month two there is one person who dies.

183
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,090
There were 22 at risk.

184
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,160
That's in the control group.

185
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,170
Now, in the treated group, there's also a
death at month two.

186
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,310
So at time point two, there's one death in
the treated group,

187
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,740
there were also 22 at risk.

188
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,740
So, the first stratum here is going to be
month two, because that's

189
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,785
the first event time, and we're going to
represent the data in a two by two table.

190
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:57,210
There were 22 people in the treated group,
and

191
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,590
22 people at the cont, in the control
group at risk at month two, total of 44.

192
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,410
There was one event in the treated group,
and one event in the control group.

193
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,270
We can represent that in a two by two
table.

194
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,110
This is the first stratum, the first event
time.

195
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,770
We then can say, well what's the observed
value of a here?

196
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,090
Here, that's just one.

197
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,150
There's one in cell a.

198
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,330
What's the expected value of a here?

199
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:24,580
Well, there were a total of 44 people,
there were a total of two events,

200
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,910
22 people in each group.

201
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,630
If the no hypothesis is true, and there's
no relationship between what group you're

202
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,610
in, and whether or not you have the event.

203
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,260
Then we would expect an even distribution
of events over the two groups.

204
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,750
So if there's two events total, we'd
expect about one in each group.

205
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,890
And that's what the expected value tells
us.

206
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,070
So 22 times two divided by 44 gives us an
expected value here of one.

207
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,330
This is the expected value under the null
hypothesis.

208
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,690
The variance is going to be the row one
times row two,

209
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,250
times column one, times column two.

210
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,700
That's the numerator, and in the
denominator the number is still at risk at

211
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,590
that event time, that's 44 squared times n
minus 1 43.

212
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,830
Again don't worry about having to
calculate out the variants.

213
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,460
Just realize that there is a way to get
the variance of a as well, and

214
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,330
that comes out to be 0.244 here.

215
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,900
So that's for the first stratum, the first
event time.

216
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,380
Let's go back to our data and see what
happens next.

217
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,900
So in the control group, the next thing
that happens is that there is a,

218
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,330
one death at month three.

219
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,020
So now we're up to two people failed,
there was 21 people at

220
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,650
risk At month three, one of them died in
the control group.

221
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,780
But let's look at the treated group.

222
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,940
If you look at the treated group, there
are no events at three months.

223
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,070
So there's still 21 at risk, but there are
no events.

224
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,100
So the 2 by 2 table for the second event
time.

225
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,420
The second stratum, that for month three
looks like this,

226
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,200
there was 21 still at risk in the treated
group and 21 in the control group.

227
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,260
Remember we, we lost, one died in month
two in each of the groups, so

228
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,180
we lost them.

229
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,250
Total of 42 are still at risk at event
time two.

230
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,150
The observed value for cell a here is
zero.

231
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,650
There were no deaths in the treated group.

232
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,350
The expected value, however, is a half.

233
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,380
Under the null hypothesis, we'd expect if
there's one total death,

234
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,290
then we'd expect about half in one and
half in another.

235
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,900
Of course, you can't have a half a death,
but that is just an expected value.

236
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,200
So 21 times one divided by 42 gives us an
expected value of 0.5.

237
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,050
The variance, if you plug into the
variance formula,

238
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,070
comes out to be a quarter.

239
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,600
And we can keep going here.

240
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,630
So, the next event time occurs at month
four.

241
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,270
In the control group at month four,
there's one more death.

242
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:39,480
There was just 20 at risk now in the
control group One of them dies.

243
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,540
In the treated group, there are no deaths
at month four, so we still have 21,

244
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,180
who are left, 21 at risk.

245
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,440
We represent that in our two by two table.

246
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,670
There were 21 treated at risk but only 20
control individuals at risk for now.

247
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,500
For a total of 41, at event time three at
four months.

248
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,940
The observed value for cell a is zero
here.

249
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,430
The expected value is one times 21 divided
by 41 or about 0.5,

250
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,050
and the variance here comes out to be 0.25
again.

251
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,210
So that's the values for the third strata.

252
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,740
And then we can keep going, you could do
this for every event time.

253
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,080
Of course you don't want to do this by
hand, the computer will do this for you.

254
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,620
But then we take all of those observed
expectant and

255
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,166
variances, and put them together in this
test system.

256
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:28,120
So there's 20, 22 unique event times in
this case.

257
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,540
I'm going to add in all the observes,

258
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,200
minus the expecteds and divide it by the
variances.

259
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,660
So, we had a one observed in the first
strata,

260
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,650
minus one expected in the second strata.

261
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,580
And there were zero observed minus a half
expected, and so on the variances.

262
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,650
For those first three strata, we're .24,
.25 and .25.

263
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,080
And then we would keep going across all
the different strata.

264
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,590
When you add all that up squared in the
numerator, add up the denominator.

265
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,494
It comes out to give you, if you did it
all at, a chi square value of 4.66.

266
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:59,160
And that's exactly what we saw from the
computer before.

267
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,250
So if we look at the output from the
computer, the Log- rank test,

268
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,790
indeed, had a chi square of 4.66.

269
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,920
That corresponds to a p-value of .03.

270
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,410
Now, as I mentioned,

271
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,670
the log rank test is most commonly used to
compare different groups in Kaplan-Meier.

272
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,390
There are other statistics that you could
use, however.

273
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,800
So I'll just point those out to you now.

274
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,540
So first of all there's something called a
likelihood ratio test.

275
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,700
The negative two Log likelihood ratio.

276
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,680
You should recognize that, that comes from
maximum likelihood estimation.

277
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,160
So this value must come from some kind of
regression.

278
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,230
And in fact, it comes from assuming an
exponential distribution.

279
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,780
So if your data, actually if your survival
curve actually follow a particular

280
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,590
distribution called the exponential, you
could fit a regression here.

281
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:51,800
That regression will give you a p-value
using negative two likelihood comparison.

282
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,860
Now you'll see that when we do that here,
the p-value comes out to be very similar.

283
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,070
But there is an assumption here So

284
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,420
just keep in mind that there is an
assumption in, in that test.

285
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,970
So unless you've evaluated that
assumption,

286
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,530
you probably want to avoid that one.

287
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,770
Now the Wilcoxon statistic, is also a chi
score with one degree of freedom.

288
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,730
It's really actually just a version of the
Log-rank test.

289
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,060
All it does is it weights the strata by
their size.

290
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,820
So remember, the earliest, event times are
going to have the most people.

291
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,130
So those are going to get the highest
weight.

292
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,430
So it's going to give a little bit more
weight to earlier time points.

293
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,280
It's going to be a little bit more

294
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,980
sensitive to differences at earlier time
points.

295
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,550
There might be a reason why you care about
giving more weight to earlier time points.

296
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,290
If, if there is a reason for that then you
might choose the Wilooxon test.

297
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,440
You can see that we get a slightly p-value
of 0.01 there were

298
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,650
really good differences early on in, in
this data set.

299
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,640
So if there is some reason you,

300
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,360
you want to wait those earlier time points
more heavily the Wilooxon will do

301
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,900
that for you.

302
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,360
But as I mentioned the Log-rank is the
most commonly used,

303
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,300
it actually turns out that they have the
most statistic power to test

304
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,540
differences between groups that fit in
proportional hazards model.

305
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,660
So it works well as a set up for

306
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,830
Cox regression which is also called the
proper proportional hazards regression.

307
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,210
So if you are, you are planning to do Cox
regression usually for the descriptive for

308
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,360
the Kaplan-Meier you end up recording the
log-rank.

309
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,420
Rank test that's most commonly done.
