1
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,800
In this next module, I'm going to show you
how linear regression accommodates

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,094
categorical predictors, and I'll also show
you the link between T-tests and

3
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:18,042
ANOVA and linear regression.

4
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:22,300
So how does linear regression handle
categorical predictors?

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,080
In the case of a binary predictor, it's
actually really easy.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,945
In the very first week of this course, I
talked a lot about binary variables,

7
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:33,270
and thinking about them as 0, 1 as new
miracle variables.

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,060
Well, that becomes useful now.

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,210
Because the way that we handle binary
variables is just to put them in

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,550
the linear regression model and treat them
as numbers as in 0 and a 1.

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,820
And that makes it easy to model and I'll
show you the picture in a minute.

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,370
Categorical variables are just slightly
more tricky.

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,400
These are variables that have more than
two categories.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,710
We are essentially going to turn them into
a series of binary, of 0, 1 variables,

15
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,810
and that's the way we're going to
accommodate them in the regression module.

16
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,030
We call this dummy coding and

17
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,020
I'm going to get to this dummy coding idea
in a few minutes.

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,790
But let's start with the easier case, with
the binary case.

19
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:16,390
Imagine for a moment that I wanted to use
vitamin D as a binary predictor.

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,580
We've been talking about this example all
week where I've been

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,680
treating vitamin D as a continuous
predictor.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,210
But there might be some reason that I end
up wanting to treat vitamin D

23
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,170
as a binary predictor.

24
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,910
Maybe I didn't measure, maybe in for some
reason my datas that I don't have it as

25
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,940
the continuous predictor or maybe for some
reason I'm clinically interested in

26
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,980
comparing the insufficient group to the
sufficient group.

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,210
So for whatever reason I'm using this
vitamin D as binary predictor.

28
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,397
If I look at my data set, and let's say
this is an arbitrary, but it was a less a,

29
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,370
less than 50 nanomoles per liter, it has
some clinical reasons for

30
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:53,300
calling that insufficient, more than that,
we'll call that sufficient.

31
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,536
We're going to code this insufficient
variable as a 1, 0, so if you're a 1,

32
00:01:56,536 --> 00:01:58,730
that means you're in the insufficient
group.

33
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,450
If you're a 0, that means you're in the
sufficient group, you know,

34
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,180
I actually looked in my data set and the
mean DSSTs for

35
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,000
the mean cognitive score in the
insufficient group indeed was lower.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,390
That in the sufficient group it was 32.5
and in the sufficient group it was 40.

37
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,490
Now, you might just think about the
lectures that we had last week, and

38
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,190
you might say oh well, here I've got a
situation where I have a continuous,

39
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,230
normally distributed outcome variable.

40
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,050
I've got two groups I want to compare.

41
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,680
I want to compare the means of that
continuous variable between two groups.

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,380
Why wouldn't I just use the t-test here?

43
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,070
And indeed, you absolutely could use a
t-test here.

44
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,290
I'm going to show you how to also use
linear regression to analyze this

45
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,280
same data.

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,380
And then, I'll show you how the liner
regression and

47
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,810
the t-test actually give you identical
answers.

48
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,510
Let me graph this for you.

49
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,270
So again, we're treating our, our binary
variable as a 0, 1 variable.

50
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,500
So, 1 means you're in the insufficient
group,

51
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,560
0 means you're sufficient, you're in the
normal level group.

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,500
The linear regression line here is the
easiest possible line you can draw.

53
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,680
So what I'm showing you here, these little
individual points represent all of

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,685
the DSST levels for all the people in the
normal group.

55
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:13,010
Their mean level is right here at 40, that
was the mean in

56
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:18,310
the in the normal group, the vitamin D
insufficient group over here,

57
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,620
this is all their DSST levels, their mean
as I mentioned was 32.5.

58
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,770
So what's this line?

59
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,840
All I did to draw this line was connect
the two means.

60
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,790
It's really, it's like the simplest line
you can possibly draw.

61
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,450
Any two points, you can connect them and
draw a line and

62
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,320
it's, we don't have to test the linearity
assumption here,

63
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,570
because when you have two points, it's
automatically going to make a line.

64
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,740
So that's nice.

65
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,600
The intercept of this line as you can see
here is 40.

66
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,110
What's the slope of this line going to be?

67
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:53,250
Well, the x variable only goes from 0 to
1, so there's only a one unit change in x.

68
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,900
What happens to y when x goes from 0 to 1?

69
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Well, y goes from 40 down to 32.5.

70
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,340
So the slope of this line is going to be
40 minus 32.5 or 7.5.

71
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,740
Notice that that's just the difference in
means between the two groups.

72
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,570
I then took these data, and

73
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,460
actually ran them officially in a linear
regression program.

74
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,150
And indeed, not surprisingly, what I get
out in the model is,

75
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,790
here is my parameter estimates.

76
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,480
So the, the intercept is 40 and the
difference in means, the,

77
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,330
the beta here is negative 7.5,

78
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,640
because we're decreasing as we're going
from sufficient to insufficient.

79
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,740
It's highly statistically significant as
you can see.

80
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,290
This is just given back the equation of
this line, we could also kind of

81
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,850
look at the graph again to, to see the
equation of that line.

82
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,030
Again, the intercept represents the mean
value in the sufficient group.

83
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,680
The slope here just represents the
difference in

84
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,453
means between the two groups and it is
statistically significant.

85
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:52,180
Now, I want to show you, what if, what
would have happened had we just ran these

86
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,700
data in a t-test rather than bothering to
get fancy and run a linear regression?

87
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,789
Well, we would have got the same answer.

88
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,060
Again, and we have two groups, we want to
compare means.

89
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,510
We can evaluate these data with a t-test.

90
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,700
It turns out that the slope we get from
linear regression is exactly equal to

91
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,450
the difference in means, which is the
effect of size of interest for a t-test.

92
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:15,090
And the p-values we get out are also I,
exactly identical.

93
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,080
So here's the t-test that we would run.

94
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,480
We would, in the numerator goes the
difference in means,

95
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,890
again, which is 40 minus 32.5 or 7.5.

96
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,920
We can calculate this standard error in
the denominator.

97
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,660
That turns out to be the same standard
error that you get in

98
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,280
the linear regression model on the earlier
slide.

99
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,640
The t-value comes out to be 3.46, the
p-value comes out to be 0.0008.

100
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,070
And actually, if you look at the previous
slide,

101
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,280
you can see that that is the t-value and
the p-value from the linear regression.

102
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,530
So there's nothing new here
mathematically, a t-test and

103
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,370
a linear regression are exactly the same.

104
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,780
You could say we don't even really need to
have a t-test in the world, because you

105
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,420
could always run that problem, that
particular problem in linear regression.

106
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,410
It's just of course, that linear
regression is more, you know,

107
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,330
seems more complicated and a t-test seems
very simple.

108
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,150
So a lot of times if it, we have the
simplest problem,

109
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,470
we end up just defaulting to t-test rather
than calling it a linear regression.

110
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,800
But in fact, a t-test is a special case of
linear regression.

111
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,600
Now, I'm going to move to the more tricky
concept,

112
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,081
which is what to do when you have more
than two categories?

113
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:17,574
You have a categorical predictor

114
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:22,479
with more than two categories.

115
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,720
What we're going to have to do here is to
do some dummy coding.

116
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,230
We're going to translate our categories
into a series of binary variables,

117
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,774
so that we can deal again with binary
variables.

118
00:06:33,774 --> 00:06:36,450
So, what what if our vitamin D variable
had been

119
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,460
a categorical predictor rather than a
continuous predictor?

120
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,060
What if there were three levels we cared
about?

121
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,290
The deficient, that's like the really low
people,

122
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,090
insufficient kind of mildly low and, and
sufficient.

123
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,950
Sometimes people will divide it up this
way.

124
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,258
I want to know about the difference in
DSST scores between those three groups.

125
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:55,915
I could analyze those data then with an
ANOVA, a simple ANOVA as we

126
00:06:55,915 --> 00:07:00,124
talked about last week, and I also could
analyze it with linear regression.

127
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:02,194
So let me just tell you what the means.

128
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:04,450
The mean DSST score in all these three
groups were.

129
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,490
So the sufficient group,

130
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,600
the normal groups is still the same here,
the average was still 40.

131
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,010
The insufficient group now excludes the
ones who are lower than 25.

132
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,640
So the average in that group is now 33.13.

133
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,820
And in the deficient group, it turns out
that the mean DSST score is 30.13.

134
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,090
So it does seem to go down across those
groups.

135
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,910
How do we dummy code this?

136
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,540
How do we dummy code these three
categories?

137
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,240
So here's dummy coding.

138
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,627
If I want to take a three-level
categorical variable,

139
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:34,190
I can represent it as a series of binary
variables.

140
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,500
I actually only need two binary variables
if it's a three-level variable.

141
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,580
If it was a four-level categorical
variable,

142
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,980
I would need three binary variables, and
so on.

143
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,820
There's going to be one group that's the
reference group and

144
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,350
that's going to be the variable that has a
0 on all the, on all the binary variables.

145
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,860
Let me illustrate that here.

146
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,190
So I'm going to make two new variables.

147
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,270
I'm going to create a new variable that is
deficient, Yes or No.

148
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,760
It's binary, you're either in the
deficient category or you're not.

149
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,800
And another one, insufficient, that's a
variable,

150
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,620
another binary, that says your either in
the insufficient group or you're not.

151
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,155
So if you're somebody in the deficient
group,

152
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,420
you're going to get a 1 on the deficient
variable, but

153
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,278
a 0 on the insufficient variable.

154
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:14,115
If you're in the insufficient group,

155
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:16,800
you're going to get a 0 on the deficient
group, because you're not,

156
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,120
you're not deficient, but you're going to
get a 1 on the insufficient.

157
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,452
If you're in the sufficient group,

158
00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:25,370
however, you're going to get a 0 on both
of those.

159
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,530
So notice that two binary variables is
sufficient to uniquely identify all

160
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,708
three of those categories.

161
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:36,380
Now, we have a reference group and we have
a series of binary variable that tell us

162
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,290
about the deficient group and the
sufficient group and

163
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,380
the difference between the insufficient
group and the sufficient group.

164
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,600
How do we represent this in pictures?

165
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,630
So it looks a lot like the pictures we did
for the simple binary predictor.

166
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,430
The insufficient group, the, again the
mean level of DSST for

167
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,430
the insufficient group was about 33, the
mean for the normal group is 40.

168
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,880
That forms a simple line, the intercept is
40, the slope is about negative 7.

169
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,835
For the deficient group, same intercept,

170
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:13,210
because we're still comparing against the
normal group.

171
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,230
The slope here, the, the mean for the
deficient group is about 30.

172
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,280
So the slope here is almost 10.

173
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,580
Now technically, this is a multivariate
regression because we

174
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,330
now have two predictors in the model.

175
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,530
I could represent these pictures on a
plane, it's just harder to

176
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,950
draw that plane, so I have represented
this as two separate graphs here.

177
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,480
I took though, the data and

178
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,220
I put them into the computer and ask it to
run a linear regression with this dummy,

179
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,320
these dummy coded variables and here are
the results that I get.

180
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,195
So here is my model, here is my key
values.

181
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:49,910
Again, the intercept represents the mean
value in the reference group.

182
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,098
That's 40, that's the normal growth.

183
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:56,240
The beta coefficient, the slope for the
insufficient group represents

184
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,530
the difference in the DSST levels between
the normal group and

185
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,990
the insufficient group, the difference
from the reference.

186
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,188
So the insufficient group was about almost
seven units lower in

187
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:11,070
cognitive score than the normal group.

188
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,940
The deficient group was almost ten units
lower in the cognitive score than

189
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,935
the normal group, so that's the sub for
them.

190
00:10:16,935 --> 00:10:19,930
Both are highly statistically significant.

191
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,740
That's the linear regression equation
written out.

192
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,290
And we can use that to then predict what's
the mean value for

193
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,780
those in the insufficient group, those in
the deficient group, and

194
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,690
those in the the normal group.

195
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,070
And you're going to see that for the
simple model, it's nothing too profound.

196
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,670
The 40 is the mean, in the reference
group.

197
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,060
Negative 6.87 represents the difference of
means between insufficient and

198
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,630
sufficient groups.

199
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,880
Of course then, negative 9.87 represents
the difference in

200
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,580
means between deficient and sufficient
groups.

201
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,360
And you can just show this by applying the
equation.

202
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,280
So, if I've got a person in the deficient
group,

203
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,600
how do I apply this equation to them?

204
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,279
Well, they get they get the intercept.

205
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,690
They get a 0 because they are not an
insufficient group and

206
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,260
they get a 1 for being deficient.

207
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,410
So when you do 40 minus 9.87, that's, that
just gives you

208
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:13,300
back out what we already knew was the mean
in the the deficient group.

209
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,220
A person in the insufficient group, when
you apply the equation, they get a 1 for

210
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,600
insufficient, a 0 for deficient when you
add that up, it comes out to be 33.13.

211
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,990
Again, what we already knew was the mean
in the insufficient group.

212
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,710
And the person who's in the sufficient
group gets a 0 for

213
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:31,330
both the insufficient and deficient
variables, so they're just left with 40,

214
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,520
which again, we knew was the mean in the
normal group.

215
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,490
So it, it's a little, like this isn't, you
know,

216
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,810
it's just spitting back out the means.

217
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,050
It doesn't seem all that profound.

218
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,385
It doesn't seem all that useful but the
reason it's

219
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:45,775
going to be useful is because we might
want to adjust for other variables.

220
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:49,840
ANOVA is just linear regression.

221
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,440
So the p-value that you would get if you
ran an ANOVA here is exactly the same as

222
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,326
the p-value you're going to get for the
overall model fit for linear regression.

223
00:11:58,326 --> 00:12:02,300
So again mathematically, these things are
identical.

224
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,270
So when you, you, you could argue that you
never need an ANOVA,

225
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,089
you can always just run a linear
regression.
