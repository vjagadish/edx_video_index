2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,230
Hi my name is Sharon Chen.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,200
In this video we are going to discuss more
about the viruses that

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,520
cause Upper Respiratory Tract Infections
and

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,820
relate their clinical symptoms to their
pathogenesis.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,890
The Learning Objectives are to describe a
general model for the pathogenesis of

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,805
viral respiratory tract infections that
explain the symptoms and

8
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:21,832
clinical manifestations.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,380
To relate the epidemiology and clinical
manifestations to the pathogenesis of

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,470
viral respiratory tract infections caused
by Rhinovirus, Coronavirus, Adenovirus and

11
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,250
Parainfluenza virus.

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,880
Here is the pathogen list for our course.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,510
In this video and the entire module,

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,600
I will be discussing these viruses that
cause Respiratory Infections.

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,450
I'm going to use the same anatomic
framework that I've shown you before for

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,280
this discussion, but what I want to do
first is to talk about a general scheme of

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,890
how these viruses cause disease in the
upper respiratory tract.

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,000
I will use our framework to show you how
the virus fulfills its life cycle,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,620
interacts within the immune system to
cause clinical disease.

20
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,530
This is a diagram of an airway, so the
lumen is at the top.

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,400
The epithelial layers next and their job
is to clear the airway of debris.

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,027
It is lined by ciliated epithelial cells
and

23
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:18,060
also contains mucus secreting cells called
goblet cells.

24
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,370
The mucus that goblet cells produce is
constantly being moved out of

25
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,510
the airway by the cilia.

26
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,394
You can see that in the video.

27
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:28,400
Underneath the epithelium is connective
tissue containing blood vessels and

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,950
smooth muscle.

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,400
Now, as we mentioned before most
respiratory viruses will be transmitted by

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,800
droplets and enter via the nose or mouth.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,390
In this person, you can see the virus
enters the nose and

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,610
then reaches the epithelial surface.

33
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,950
If the virus is lucky enough to not be
cleared by the cilia.

34
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,630
It may find a specific receptor on the
epithelial cell.

35
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,350
These receptors determine whether or

36
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,100
not the virus can enter that cell and
thus, the location of infection.

37
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,560
This is the concept of Tropism.

38
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,400
Once it enters, the virus rapidly
replicates in the cytosol because RNA

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,980
viruses are ready to make protein.

40
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,440
One of the first thing it does is to
enslave that cell to be a virus factory.

41
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,430
So, for example, Rhinovirus closes the
nuclear pores and

42
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,770
shuts down host cells' transcription, so

43
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,350
that epithelial cell will use all of its
machinery to make virus.

44
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,910
Now as the infection progresses, viruses
will spread to neighbouring,

45
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,520
unaffected cells, effecting more of the
epithelial lining.

46
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,960
Infected cells begin to sense the foreign
invaders,

47
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,720
by detecting pathogen associated molecular
patterns, or PAMPs.

48
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,300
This represents the beginning of innate
immune defense.

49
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,610
The infected epithelial cells send signals
to try and stop the infection.

50
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,240
The signals include secretion of
Interferon, other cytokines, and

51
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,952
chemokines, to recruit immune cells into
the local area, which then extravisate.

52
00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:52,900
These cytokines and chemokines also
stimulate mucus production and release.

53
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:59,330
All of this results in increases in
vascular permeability,

54
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,650
which cause swelling of the walls of the
airway,

55
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,420
it increases inflammatory cell
infiltration into the interstitial tissue,

56
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,840
and it fills up the airway lumen with
mucus and cellular debris.

57
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,720
What the patient notices is a lot of
swelling, mucus and debris.

58
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,460
In order to exit,

59
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,165
viruses need to be released back into the
lumen of the airway.

60
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:26,567
Non-enveloped viruses, or naked capsids,
exit cells by lysing the cell.

61
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:32,067
Virions then enter into the environment
within mucus secretions and droplets.

62
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:36,645
Now you can see in these two images, that
the airway of the infected person has

63
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:41,440
a lot more swelling and mucus, compared to
the non infected person.

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,450
I would like you to try and

65
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,270
remember this process of how respiratory
viruses cause disease.

66
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,340
Because now, I'm going to show how this
pathogenesis explains the clinical

67
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,450
syndromes of each virus, using our
anatomic framework.

68
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,610
What we just talked about, in this series
of slides on pathogenesis is depicted very

69
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,340
well in this Rhinoscopic picture.

70
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,750
It's a nasal cavity of a person with a
respiratory virus infection.

71
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,380
And I think, you can

72
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,480
easily see that this person's nasal
turbinates are really swollen.

73
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,340
And there's some clear secretions oozing
out.

74
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,390
The swelling in this nasal cavity could
also extend into the nasopharynx and

75
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,190
the eustachian tube that connects to the
middle ear.

76
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,910
This can result in ear pain and a viral
Otitis media.

77
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,785
The two viruses that cause the common cold
or

78
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:29,410
rhinitis, are Rhinovirus and Coronavirus.

79
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,550
These viruses colonize a person
asymptomatically for two to three days.

80
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,000
This is called, the incubation period.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,800
When the innate immune system, recognizes
that we are infected with

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,000
either Rhinovirus or Coronavirus, we get
mild symptoms of a common cold.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,070
But fever and systemic symptoms are not
common.

84
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,250
Although they usually cause mild disease,
there are certain situations where they

85
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,170
can cause Lower Respiratory Tract
problems,

86
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,850
especially in people with pre-existing
lung problems.

87
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,720
People who smoke, or el, elderly patients
might have more problems.

88
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,840
Immunocompromised patients are at
increased risk of more severe disease,

89
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,470
including pneumonia.

90
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,440
I take care of a number of children, who
are immunocompromised at our hospital.

91
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,360
So I can tell you first-hand that
respiratory viral infections in

92
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,090
these children can progress to the point
that they need hospitalization in

93
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,950
an Intensive Care Unit because they're so
sick.

94
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,650
I very actively educate our providers and

95
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,500
parents to not ignore a cold in these
particular children.

96
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,050
Here's an image of the Baltimore
classification scheme.

97
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,140
And both Rhinovirus and Chronovirus are
RNA viruses and fall here in group four.

98
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,390
RNA viruses are ready to make protein and

99
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,060
thus can quickly replicate in the cytosol
to make new vir, virions.

100
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,360
This is why they cause such an acute
infection.

101
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,940
Although, these two viruses have many
similarities,

102
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,860
they're actually different viruses.

103
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,440
There are hundreds of serotypes for

104
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,020
Rhinovirus but only six serogroups for
Coronavirus.

105
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,200
Rhinovirus is a naked capsid,

106
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,110
which allows them to be more resistant to
desiccation and to detergents.

107
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,960
The capsid however, can be destroyed in
the low pH of their stomach.

108
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,870
And this is very different from the other
viruses that Rhinoviruses are related to

109
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,180
in this family Picornaviridae.

110
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,590
Polio virus, Enterovirus, Coxackievirus,
and Hepatits A virus all survive stomach

111
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,880
acid and replicate in the gastrointestinal
tract.

112
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,110
Now, the name of this family may help you
remember this virus.

113
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,820
Think of it, as PICO RNA, a very small
RNA.

114
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,415
In contrast to the naked capsid
Rhinovirus,

115
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:31,360
Cronavirus has an envelope, which means it
is

116
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,030
relatively more susceptible to desiccation
of detergents in the environment.

117
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,130
The name Coronavirus comes from the
spike-like of proteins that

118
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,820
create a crown appearance.

119
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,310
And you can see this crown appearance in
the image on the slide.

120
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,190
Corona means crown.

121
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,030
In the family of Coronaviridae there are
two new emerging viruses.

122
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,210
Severe Acute respiratory Syndrome or

123
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,630
SARS Coronavirus, and Middle East
respiratory Syndrome, or MERS Coronavirus.

124
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,010
Prior to SARS,

125
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,170
Coronavirus infections in humans were
thought to just be common colds.

126
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,750
But in 2003, a respiratory infection
outbreak started in China,

127
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,570
and quickly spread to the rest of the
world via travelers.

128
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,730
It was eventually figured out to be SARS
and

129
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,470
this particular Coronavirus caused
significant mortality.

130
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,040
The case fatality rate was about 10%
overall.

131
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,350
Goes up to 50% in the elderly.

132
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,120
I still remember this outbreak vividly.

133
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,440
This was an exciting and

134
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,420
frightening time for me and other
infectious disease doctors.

135
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,090
At the time many of us suspected that the
outbreak was the start of

136
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,020
the influenza pandemic that we'd all been
waiting for.

137
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,730
But no one knew what it was and how bad it
was going to be.

138
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,020
I distinctly remember the fear and dread
of just not knowing.

139
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,320
And the fact that doctors had been
infected by their patients and

140
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,810
some had died made things even worse.

141
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,480
During this outbreak, I had to take care
of one little boy who had just come

142
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,820
back from China with this family.

143
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,060
He had a fever and a mild cough.

144
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,060
He ended up not having SARS infection but

145
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,540
of course they didn't know that at the
time.

146
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,590
I must confess I had a bit of fear going
into see my patient.

147
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,400
You can imagine that I paid very close
attention to how I put on and

148
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,990
took off my protective gear.

149
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,710
Now, this outbreak was a good lesson to me
and

150
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,210
should be a good lesson to you that
emerging viral infections will occur.

151
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,404
We need to all be vigilant.

152
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:17,660
[BLANK_AUDIO]

153
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,740
A current outbreak of a new emerging viral
infection is MERS Coronavirus,

154
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,440
first reported in 2012.

155
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,414
It's case fatality rate is even higher
than SARS at 40% but

156
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:29,770
it hasn't spread as fast.

157
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,380
Interestingly, both are zoonosis.

158
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,860
SARS was eventually found to have it's
natural reservoir in bats.

159
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,240
For MERS, there is some recent evidence
that camels can transmit the virus to

160
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,300
humans but the actual natural reservoir is
still not known.

161
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,130
The next clinical syndrome to discuss is
Pharyngitis and Laryngitis.

162
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,920
These are predominantly caused by
Adenovirus, and Parainfluenza virus.

163
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,930
Adenovirus typic,

164
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,000
typically causes a prominent fever in
addition to the pharyngitis.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,460
The tonsils and the adenoids are right
behind the pharyngeal tissue that you

166
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,890
can see in this picture.

167
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,560
In fact, the name of the virus comes from
adenoids, adeno.

168
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,110
The tonsil and

169
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,240
adenoids are also the location where the
Adenovirus can persist for a long time.

170
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,360
I told you before, I take care of many of
these immunocompromised patients.

171
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,510
And they can reactivate their Adenovirus.

172
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,420
More often than not, it causes really
severe disease in these patients and

173
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,340
I typically give them treatment early and
quickly.

174
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,730
Adenovirus can also cause conjunctivitis.

175
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,920
And you can see this in the picture of
this eye.

176
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,360
The conjunctiva are completely injected
and red.

177
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,340
Now, both the pharyngitis and
conjunctivitis are caused by similar

178
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,840
process of pathogenesis that I described
to you at the beginning of the video.

179
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,855
As I already mentioned, Adenovirus can be
especially deadly in

180
00:09:45,855 --> 00:09:49,690
immunocompromised hosts, unlike other
respiratory viruses Adenovirus can go

181
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,310
beyond the epithilialium, and actually
cause a systemic infection.

182
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,320
This can be with viremia, hepatitis, and
other in organ disease.

183
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,820
This may be why immunecompromised hosts
get so sick.

184
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,470
Adenovirus is characterized by more than
50 serotypes.

185
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,080
Only, although, only a portion of these
cause respiratory symptoms.

186
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,368
Unlike the other respiratory viruses,

187
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:14,541
Adenovirus can cause Gastrointestinal
disease.

188
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:18,933
The other difference is that Adenovirus is
the only DNA respiratory virus.

189
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:20,829
Now, like other naked capsid viruses,

190
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,300
they are relatively hardy against
desiccation detergents.

191
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,520
Adenovirus can also travel and transit
through the gastrointestinal tract, and

192
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,040
transmits by the fecal-oral route.

193
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,570
The cartoon that you see of Adenovirus
shows the capsid in blue.

194
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:39,020
The red spikes are called fiber proteins
and the globular end attaches the virus to

195
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,790
the host cell receptor in the tight
junctions that join cells.

196
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,280
In the Adenoviridae family, there are no
other viruses that infect humans but

197
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,899
there are many viruses in this family that
can infect other animals and

198
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:51,733
are species specific.

199
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,045
The other virus that can cause Pharyngitis
is Parainfluenza virus.

200
00:10:57,045 --> 00:11:01,680
Parainfluenza virus is also the typical
virus that causes Croup.

201
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,210
And although, I've listed this in the
lower respiratory track,

202
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,490
I'm going to discuss Parainfluenza virus
and Croup here.

203
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,690
Croup is quite distinctive and it's
because of its cough.

204
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,100
It is a barking cough associated with
inspiratory stridor.

205
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,734
Here's what it sounds like.

206
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:21,795
[SOUND] Fever and

207
00:11:21,795 --> 00:11:31,800
hoarseness are also quite common.

208
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,120
The cough improves if you take the child
outside in the cold air.

209
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,890
Croup is quite common in the fall in,

210
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,480
in contrast to many of the respiratory
viruses that peak in the winter.

211
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,797
There are four types of Parainfluenza, and

212
00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:47,710
type one is most often impli, implicated
with Croup.

213
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,850
Parainfluenza virus buds out of the cell
only at the apical surface,

214
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,760
where it then infects neighboring cells.

215
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,840
This is likely why we rarely see viremia.

216
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,260
Because it buds out of the cell,

217
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,360
Parainfluenza doesn't cause cell death
like Rhinovirus, but

218
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,010
it does increase the replication rate of
epithelial cells so more cells are shed.

219
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,529
It increases the number of mucus cells,
increasing mucus production and

220
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,950
it also decreases cilary motility.

221
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,510
All this together increases cellular
debris, mucous, and

222
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,500
swelling all along the wall of the
trachea.

223
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,740
The subglottic area of the trachea is
already narrow in children, so

224
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,610
even a small amount of swelling and

225
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:29,630
mucous will more easily cause Stenosis in
this area and cause the classic symptoms.

226
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,766
Here's a picture of what the su,

227
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:33,950
Subglottic Stenosis looks, like on
radiograph.

228
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,800
You can see the narrowing of that region.

229
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,790
This radiographic sign is called the
Steeple sign.

230
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,890
For the most part though, Croup is a
clinical diagnosis not a Radiographic one.

231
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:51,220
Parainfluenza virus is an RNA virus like
most of the respiratory viruses.

232
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,470
However, it's enveloped which is different
from some of the other RNA viruses.

233
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,710
It has four serotypes and their clinical
manifestations can vary.

234
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,810
Reinfections are common.

235
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,280
And this could be a result of the virus
budding from the apical surface of

236
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,230
the cell not allowing a chance for the
immune cells to appropriately respond.

237
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:14,700
I should point out, that Parainfluenza
virus is not related to influenza virus.

238
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,270
Parainfluenza virus is actually in the
family Paramyxoviridae.

239
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,840
And you can see that in this family there
are two other respiratory viruses.

240
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,730
RSV, Respiratory Syncytial Virus and
Metapneumovirus.

241
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,120
We will be discussing these two viruses in
depth in the video on

242
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,955
lower respiratory tract infections.

243
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:36,980

244
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,968
This next slide is for you as a resource.

245
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:42,467
So that you can review this material
later.
