1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:06,447
Question one is asking about the amount of
exercise that student with ID number 2

2
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:09,230
reported in the survey.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,662
And the first thing were going to do is
find student number 2 and

4
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:16,776
that would be right here in the left hand
side.

5
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:22,400
So all of the values in this row, belong
to student number 2, okay.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,360
So I'm just going to highlight that right
here, and

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,660
then, of course, the question's asking you
about exercise.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,390
And so the exercise variable's right here.

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:38,300
And we see that the value for student 2 is
zero hours of exercise per week.

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,828
This questions asking about which one of
these variables are a,

11
00:00:41,828 --> 00:00:47,140
is a continous variable and the answer of
course is age at first birth.

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,099
This is the only continous variable in the
list.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,770
Favorite fruit, gender, and occupation are
all categorical variables.

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,187
Okay, these are nominal variables because
they're classifying responses into

15
00:00:59,187 --> 00:01:01,550
different categories.

16
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:09,490
Decade of birth is an ordinal variable
because it is categorizing with an order.

17
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:14,690
That is there's a relationship between
each subsequent group.

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:20,910
And so, we call that a nominal excuse me,
an ordinal variable.

19
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,200
This next question is asking us about to
pick the categorical variable, and

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,180
specifically the nominal.

21
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,810
Variable as opposed to the ordinal
variable.

22
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,020
Okay, so a nominal variable does not have
an order inherent to it.

23
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,750
Whereas an ordinal variable does.

24
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,471
And so of course the answer here is
favorite fruit, okay?

25
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:43,690
So strawberries, bananas, oranges.

26
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,960
These don't have an order to them.

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,760
And so they can be considered, or

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,720
rather this favorite fruit category can be
considered a nominal variable.

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,690
Now if the question had asked you which
one was an ordinal variable?

30
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,466
You would pick decade of birth, because
decade of birth would categorize you

31
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:05,260
into different buckets but these buckets
would have a relationship.

32
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,675
They would be in a certain order so that
would be an ordinal variable.

33
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:10,149
BMI, age at first birth and

34
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:15,132
height, of course would be categorized as
continuous variables.

35
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:22,069
And that's due to the nature of the
responses for each of those choices.

36
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:27,310
This question shows us a histogram for
pulse rates.

37
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,320
And it's specifically asking us what
percentage of

38
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,943
subjects had pulses between 80 and 90%.

39
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:37,390
Or excuse me, 80 and 90 beats per minute.

40
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,352
And so we going to, we're going to look at
the histogram.

41
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:44,122
All right, and we're going to think about
the cumulative percentage between 80,

42
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,669
which is right here, and 90, which is
about here.

43
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,919
Okay its half way between 80 100 and so
we're going to ball part this.

44
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,620
Because these are all basically below 10
and

45
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,646
these look like they might be even below
5.

46
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:02,690
You can make an adequate guess and

47
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,104
say that the closest answer to this is e
10 percent.

48
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:12,960
It's definitely not 200%, 100%, 90% and
it's probably not 50%.

49
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,504
Just because 13.3 is up here and so if you
can imagine stacking this bar on top

50
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:27,170
of here and all these small bars on top
and even really reaching that 13.3%.

51
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:33,003
As a review, I'd like to just point out
that this is a left skewed distribution.

52
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:36,903
So a left skewed distribution means that
the mean is going to be

53
00:03:36,903 --> 00:03:39,503
less than the median.

54
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:42,503
So the mean is going to fall somewhere
around here,

55
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:47,530
the median is probably going to be
somewhere around here.

56
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,546
This question shows us another histogram,

57
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:53,074
this histogram shows the percentage of
students.

58
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:56,729
In buckets of sleep hours per night.

59
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,700
So the statistical program,

60
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,200
bend the number of sleep hours per night
into these categories for us.

61
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,320
And so let's take a look at the question.

62
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,360
So it's asking us to pick the true
statement.

63
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,382
A is asking or

64
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:17,252
A is stating more than half of the
students slept seven hours per night.

65
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:19,684
Looking quickly at the diagram, we see
that so

66
00:04:19,684 --> 00:04:24,747
more than seven hours would be everything
to the right of this line.

67
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:28,312
And that's not more than 50%, so we know a
is not true.

68
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:32,359
B states that more than half of the
students slept between 6.5 and

69
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:34,850
7.5 hours per night.

70
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,812
And so, that would, that category of
students is actually just this bar okay?

71
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:45,479
And that is above 50 and so b here is the
correct answer.

72
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,393
But lets go through the rest of the answer
choices just to make sure that they

73
00:04:50,393 --> 00:04:57,950
are also force, c reads, at least one
student slept 10 or more hours per night.

74
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,300
There's no one in the 10 category so we
know that's false.

75
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,891
And D reads 25% of students slept six
hours or fewer per night.

76
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:11,337
Looking at six or fewer we see that this,

77
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:18,360
it would be this percentage plus this
percentage.

78
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,556
So, right here.

79
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:24,131
These two blocks together would need to
reach somewhere around here, and

80
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:30,136
sort of visually, by visual inspection, we
see that that's not true.

81
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:33,332
So this question gives us a list of
numbers, and asks us to

82
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:40,650
calculate the median value within this set
of numbers, this set of 20 numbers.

83
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,890
So this is one of those tedious problems
where you have to actually order

84
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:48,460
the numbers the right way in order to
calculate the median value.

85
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,060
So that's what I'm going to do first.

86
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,925
So, [COUGH] going to write this at the
bottom here.

87
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:59,976
I'm actually

88
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:05,745
going to stop

89
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:12,180
there.

90
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,200
So, let's think about this.

91
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,792
So, There are 20 numbers, and so the
median value is going to be between

92
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:28,920
number 10, the average of number 10, so,
like, number 10 and number 11.

93
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,940
So this is going to equal the median.

94
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,990
And I know that because there are 20
numbers here.

95
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,934
So I just need to figure out what the 10th
and

96
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:39,000
11th numbers to then calculate their
average.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,860
So this is 1, this is 2, this 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.

98
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,976
And so the average of course of negative
12 and

99
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:53,060
negative 14 is going to be negative 13.

100
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,850
So the median value in this set of numbers
Is negative 13.

101
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,170
So this question is asking us about left
skewed data.

102
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,630
And it's asking us to pick the true
statement.

103
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,859
So as a review, left skewed data would
look something like this.

104
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,760
Where the tail on the left-hand side is a
lot longer.

105
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,565
And what this is going to do to the
distribution is it's going to shift

106
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:18,710
the mean to the left, okay?

107
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,590
The mean is going to go left.

108
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,300
So the mean might be somewhere around
here.

109
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,528
The median Might be somewhere around here.

110
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:33,580
Just for completeness sake, the mode would
be the top of the histogram.

111
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,030
The distribution of the histogram, and so

112
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,590
which statement accurately captures this
relationship?

113
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,490
Well, that's going to be statement d.

114
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,620
Where the median is going to be greater
than the mean.

115
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,394
So one trick when remembering when trying
to remember left-skewed right-skewed and

116
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:53,748
stuff like that is to remember this exact
relationship.

117
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:56,982
If it's left-skewed the median is to the
left excuse me,

118
00:07:56,982 --> 00:08:00,300
the mean is to the left of the median.

119
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,320
And if it's right-skewed the mean is to
the right of the median.

120
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,400
Okay, so you can think about it as

121
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,760
describing a relationship between the mean
and the median.

122
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,612
And then you'll be able to sort of
intuitively imagine the distribution in

123
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:13,876
your head to answer these questions.

124
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:17,836
This question is asking us to calculate
the standard deviation of

125
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:22,370
the following numbers that we have in our
data set.

126
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,580
And to round our final answer to the
nearest whole number.

127
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:33,690
And so the first step Is to remember what
the formula for the standard deviation is.

128
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,668
And so I'll start off by writing that out,
so that is SD, for

129
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:45,120
standard deviation equals the square root
of the sum on top, that's an i there.

130
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,320
Of X sub I, minus the mean squared, over N
minus 1.

131
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,726
Okay, so that looks complicated, but

132
00:08:53,726 --> 00:09:01,940
basically we need to figure out two
things.

133
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,576
In order to calculate this formula, we
need to figure out what n is, and

134
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:09,310
what this x bar is.

135
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,110
X bar is the average.

136
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,870
So first things first.

137
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,720
So n is probaby easiest.

138
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,020
So n is just the number the number of
numbers.

139
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,900
I guess in our data set, so that's going
to be one, two, three, four, five, six,

140
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,205
seven, so that's going to be ten.

141
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:27,330
Okay, so n is ten.

142
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,420
And then we calculate the average here.

143
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,509
So that's just going to be 4 plus 3 plus 0
plus dot, dot,

144
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:41,630
dot, all the way to negative 300, divided
by N or ten, same thing.

145
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:47,420
And that's going to work itself out to be
negative 34.5.

146
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,548
So here we have the average and we have N
and what we can do is

147
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:59,700
replace these in the formula and so I'm
going to write This in, so n is now ten.

148
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,150
And so it's x minus negative 34.5.

149
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,580
And that's the same thing as x of i plus
34.5.

150
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,930
So you might be wondering to yourself,
what is this x of i,

151
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,330
what is this summation doing here?

152
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,870
I think the easiest way to explain it is
to,

153
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,295
is to write out the first A few terms
here.

154
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay, so what is this saying?

155
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,410
So it's saying, we'll take the first
number in your data set when i equals one.

156
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:34,448
So that's going to be four, and then add
34.5, square that.

157
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:34,952
Okay, and

158
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:39,929
because this is the summation, here
because we're summing in this expression.

159
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:41,729
What we're going to do is going to add,
and

160
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:45,863
that we're going to move on to the next
number in your dataset.

161
00:10:45,863 --> 00:10:51,613
Which is going to be 3, okay, I you can
imagine i, e being equal to 2 now.

162
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:57,541
So accept 2 or 3 plus 34.5 squared, plus
again,

163
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:06,305
because of the summation, 0 plus 34.5
squared.

164
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:10,540
Okay, and we're going to do that all the
way

165
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,955
until negative 300 plus 34.5 squared,
okay?

166
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:18,999
So that takes care of the numerator.

167
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:24,290
And then on the bottom we're just going to
have 10 minus 1, which is 9.

168
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:29,210
And, if we do this all out, that is going
to equal 94.

169
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,334
And so, the answer to this question is a
94.

170
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:37,430
So in this question, we're asked to
calculate the standard deviation again,

171
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,720
and round our final answer to the nearest
whole number.

172
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,750
'Kay, so it's very similar.

173
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,940
It's the same thing as the last question,
so it's good practice for us.

174
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:50,950
So once again, the first step Is to write
out the formula for

175
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,240
the standard deviation, and that hasn't
changed since last time.

176
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,370
So, that's going to be the square root of
the sum of x

177
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:07,930
sub i minus the average, squared over n
minus 1.

178
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,850
And so once again, we need to know two
things.

179
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,220
We need to know n and we need to know the
average.

180
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,020
So, n here's going to be a I have a
feeling it's going to be 10 again, 6, 9,

181
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,360
10 yeah.

182
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,944
So n is 10, and I got that just by

183
00:12:21,944 --> 00:12:27,192
counting the numbers here and then the
average is

184
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:36,066
going to be negative 8 plus negative 10
etcetera.

185
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:39,992
Until negative 30, divide by 10.

186
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:44,079
Okay, and the average this time is going
to equal negative 18.5.

187
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,605
So now that we have these two values once
again we can rewrite our formula by

188
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:52,538
substituting those va numbers in.

189
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:59,260
So again This is just going to be the same
thing as adding 18.5 here.

190
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,252
So, I'm going to write the first few terms
once again.

191
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:09,805
So this is going to be negative 8 plus
18.5 squared.

192
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:15,309
Plus negative 10 plus 18.5 squared all the
way to

193
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:20,823
the last number in our data set.

194
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:28,840
Let me just drag that over, all divided by
9, okay?

195
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,940
And the standard deviation in this case is
going to equal 7, so

196
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,790
the answer to this problem is e, 7.

197
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,944
This problem asks us to calculate the
interquartile range given the follow data

198
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:48,794
points, the first thing you should notice
is that the data is arranged.

199
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:52,506
For us is already sorted in descending
order which is great because it means we

200
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:54,850
don't have to do that.

201
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,203
That would otherwise be the first step.

202
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,750
So now, what are we going to do.

203
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,098
Well, our approach to these types of
problems is going to first, is going to be

204
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:06,640
to first find the median, okay, which
represents the 50th percentile.

205
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,112
And then let's say that's the edge of our
data set, and that's the edge of

206
00:14:10,112 --> 00:14:14,540
our data set, (no period) And then, to
find the middle, okay?

207
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,531
So that's going to be the 75th percentile,
and then to move this way.

208
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:23,171
To find the middle, the median,
essentially, between here and

209
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:26,340
here, to find the 25th percentile.

210
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,380
Okay, great and of course we're doing that
because the interquartile range is defined

211
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:38,140
as the value of the 75th percentile minus
the value of the 25th percentile.

212
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,770
So lets take a look at the data.

213
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,800
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, okay, always ten.

214
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,540
So there's ten values here.

215
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,276
Which means the median is going to be the
average of negative four and

216
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:49,700
negative five.

217
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,550
So median is going to be negative 4.5.

218
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,910
But that's less important right now.

219
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,885
What's more important is to sort of
visualize Is this sort of

220
00:14:58,885 --> 00:15:02,720
middle 50th percentile line here.

221
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,968
Right, and what we're going to do,

222
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:07,051
is we're going to find, we're going to
move left, starting here.

223
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:09,787
We're going to move we're going to move
right starting here, move left

224
00:15:09,787 --> 00:15:13,980
starting here, find the middle value, the
median of this subset of numbers.

225
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,000
And that's going to be negative 14.

226
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,100
Doing the same thing here the median is
going to be zero within that subset, okay?

227
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,637
What that's going to allow us to do is to
say that, okay,

228
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:27,469
this is the 75th percentile, this is the
25th percentile,

229
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:31,496
the IQR is simply 0 minus negative 14 or
14.

230
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:34,984
So the answer to this question is c, 14.

231
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:40,441
This question asks us to select the
statistical measure that

232
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:45,989
does not describe the spread of the data.

233
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:49,823
Our choices are variance, interquartile
range, the Standard deviation, the range,

234
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,152
and the mean.

235
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:54,190
So of these choices the mean is the only
choice that does not

236
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,991
describe the spread of the data.

237
00:15:56,991 --> 00:16:01,239
All the other choices, the the variance,
IQR, the standard deviation,

238
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:05,919
the range give some kind of information
about the distribution of the data and

239
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,440
how its spread out.

240
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,267
The mean is a summary statistic, so

241
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:15,130
it does not give us any information about
the spread.

242
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:20,440
This last question is asking us to choose
the statistical measure that

243
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,260
is not influenced by outliers.

244
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,657
Our choices are the variance, the
interquartile range,

245
00:16:26,657 --> 00:16:30,400
the standard deviation, the range, and the
mean.

246
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,784
The only value here that is not influenced
by outliers is

247
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,820
the interquartile range, okay?

248
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,775
The variance, the standard deviation, the
range and the mean will all be affected.

249
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:44,037
Let's say if you change one of your
numbers,

250
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:48,500
one of the values in your data set from
something like 30 to 300.

251
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,916
You can imagine that all those statistical
measures are going to be affected in

252
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,990
some way.

253
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,233
Now the inner quartile range in this
situation is not going to be affected if

254
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:01,711
30 is, let's say, already above the 75th
percentile.

255
00:17:01,711 --> 00:17:05,780
Let's say 30's in the 80th percentile in
your data.

256
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,733
And you change that 30 to 300, okay?

257
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:14,508
Well that's not going to affect the
calculation of the interquartile.

258
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:16,148
Because that's only 75,

259
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:23,195
the 75th quartile minus the 25th quartile
it doesn't change what the numbers are.

260
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:27,216
Okay, so another way to phrasing this,
another way to think about this is.

261
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:30,834
That the interquartile range is more
dependent on how the numbers in your

262
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:32,704
dataset are ranked.

263
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:40,198
And the other values the other statistical
measures presented

264
00:17:40,198 --> 00:17:49,133
here are more dependent on the magnitude
of the values in your data set.
