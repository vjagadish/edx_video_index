1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,800
In this next module,

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,070
I'm going to talk about the two ways that
we typically store repeated measures data.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,850
So there's two ways to represent, repeated
measures data.

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,640
You can put it in what is called the broad
form, and

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,040
often when we're doing data entry, it's
easier to enter it in the broad form.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,120
So the broad form is going to be just what
it sounds like,

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,850
it's going to be broad so every person is
going to

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,810
have only one row in the data set as we
normally do one observation, one row.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,260
And the multiple measures that you've made
over time are going to

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,570
be stored as separate variables.

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,410
So here I've got, say these are some
scores on a depression questionnaire.

12
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,540
I've got other person who had a value on
that questionnaire at time 1 of 31.

13
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,200
At time 2 it went down to 29, and then 15
and then 26.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,010
Person 2 had a depression score at time
point 1,

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,669
F24 that went to 28 at time point 2 and
then 20 and then 32 and so on.

16
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:08,095
This is the broad form of the data,

17
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:13,420
because it's broad every person will have
a lot of observations along the row.

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,150
That's one way to store the data.

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,210
However, sometimes we need the data in
what's called the long form.

20
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,950
So again, the long form's just what it
sounds like.

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,280
It's long, so

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,380
there are going to be multiple rows now
per observation, per person.

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,080
So you can see, for

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,470
example, subject number one had four
measurements of this depression score.

25
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,980
What we're now going to do, is we're
going to have only two variables.

26
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,300
That stores those depression scores,

27
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,920
one to indicate the time and one to
indicate the actual score at that time.

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,780
So for example, person number 1, ID number
1 at time point 1,

29
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,550
their depression score is 31 and at time
point two it was 29,

30
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:54,468
at time point 3 it was 15, at time point
four it was 26.

31
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:58,420
Person number 2 had a depression score of
24 at time point one,

32
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,270
28 at time point two, and so on.

33
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,990
Now, converting between these two forms,

34
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,210
can involve a little bit of trickery
having to do this in a computer.

35
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,180
Sometimes it's hard to go from one form to
the other.

36
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,260
I'll try to give you some tricks in the
computer for doing that.

37
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,200
But you can see why there might be
advantages of one form or the other.

38
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,690
So one place that we might use the broad
form, is if I wanted to

39
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,660
get the correlations in depression scores
between different time points.

40
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,900
And we need the broad form of the data.

41
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,306
Because my correlation matrix would be
time one.

42
00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:29,502
Time two, time three, and time four and

43
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:35,120
I would want to get the correlations
between all of those time points.

44
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,740
So we, I need them in the broad form.

45
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,480
However, if I wanted to plot,

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,920
the depression scores over time to do a
plot over time of these depression scores.

47
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,510
I'm going to need the data in the long
form because I want to have one

48
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,440
x variable and one y variable to plot that
over time.

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,450
So for plotting over time, I'm going to
need it in the long form.

50
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,440
So different analyses will require the
data in different forms.

51
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,410
Now I went ahead just to show you, I
plotted these six individuals.

52
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,560
I did some what we call profile plots.

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,070
So this is just one individual at a time.

54
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,370
Every rep, line represents one individual.

55
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,940
I've plotted over time the scores, but

56
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,650
you can see that in order to make that
plot I needed the long form of the data.

57
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,460
This is showing you all six individuals.

58
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,660
We can also just plot the mean, at each
time point for the six individuals.

59
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,250
And then I have superimposed those two
plots.

60
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,520
In the next module I'm going to be showing
you a lot of different plots,

61
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,380
we can do for these type of, of data.

62
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,660
Those are usually done on the long form of
the data.

63
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,810
Just to put a real data example now to
this,

64
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,350
I have some data longitudinal data on bone
density in women runners who tend,

65
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,260
who can be at risk for having low bone
density.

66
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,790
This was a two year study.

67
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,560
And bone density was measured at baseline
one year into the study and

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,440
two years into the study.

69
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,710
You measure bone density with a machine
called a DEXA machine.

70
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,430
And I've modified the data just slightly
to meet all the HIPAA rules.

71
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,200
I've jiggered some dates and changed
values a little bit and rounded things.

72
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,140
But just to show you some real data or

73
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,206
something that's very close to real data,
this is the broad form of the data.

74
00:04:04,206 --> 00:04:07,450
So the women, so for example, subject
number id number one,

75
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,780
she came in April of 1999, that's a pretty
old data set.

76
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,380
For her first measurement, and then again
in April of 2000 for

77
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,610
her next measurement, and then in May of
2001 for her next measurement.

78
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,136
Her spine bone densities were 0.93, 0.93,
and

79
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,680
0.93 beyond, so she didn't change at all
over time.

80
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,690
And her bone mineral content total calcium
in her skeleton.

81
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,860
Went down slightly at measurement two, but
didn't, was pretty stable.

82
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,280
You can see there wasn't much change for
that person there.

83
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,210
That's the broad form of the data.

84
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,920
If I want to translate this into the long
form of the data,

85
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,770
there might be two ways I can represent
time now.

86
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,880
So I can represent time as just time 0.1,
time 0.2, and time 0.3.

87
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,910
However, if you look closely, you'll
notice that there was some variation in.

88
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,570
Women were supposed to come back every
year, but

89
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,300
there was some considerable variation in
when women actually came back for

90
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,500
their subsequent, their follow-up
measurements.

91
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,270
So I could also, since I've got actual
dates,

92
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,300
I could take these dates, and I could
subtract them, and

93
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,470
I could get the actual amount of time
between measurements.

94
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,330
For a given woman, so I've done both of
those.

95
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,840
So I've now turned this into the long form
of the data.

96
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,070
So every woman had three measurements so

97
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,548
she's going to get three rows in the long
form of the data set.

98
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:18,490
I can represent time as just this one,
two, three, which measurement was it.

99
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,030
Or I can represent it more precisely.

100
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,670
So for example person number one, baseline
would be zero years into the study.

101
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,582
She came back nice and close to one year
into the study and, and

102
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:30,510
2.1 years into the study.

103
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,660
Not everybody did so well in being so
precise.

104
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,914
So like subject number seven came back at
one year, but

105
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:37,396
then not until 2.7 years into the study.

106
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:39,830
Then the spine bone densities for each of
those time period,

107
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,290
points is represented next as well as the
bone mineral content.

108
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,290
So we have one variable now storing the
spine bone density, and

109
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,350
one variable storing the bone mineral
content,

110
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,570
which again will allow us to do plots in
certain types of analyses.

111
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,610
Just to give you a quick overview of where
you'd want to use one versus the other.

112
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,650
So for you, if you want to calculate
correlations between different time

113
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,290
points you actually need the broad form of
the data.

114
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:07,700
If you took HRP 261 there were a couple of
situations where I gave you both forms

115
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,450
of the data set because you needed the
broad form for doing correlations.

116
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,220
Between time points.

117
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,210
With actually correlations between time
points then, but

118
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,440
between physician practices, if I'm
remembering that correctly.

119
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,840
You'll also need the broad form if you
want to calculate the change

120
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,350
between time points for a given woman.

121
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,300
It's actually easier to subtract within a
row than to,

122
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,810
to subtract across different rows.

123
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,050
So, it's usually easier to calculate the
change scores from the broad form.

124
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,960
When we do repeated measures in Nova next
week we'll be using the broad form

125
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,138
of the data.

126
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:37,950
However, you're going to need the long
form for

127
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,160
kind of all the really cool things you
want to do with the data.

128
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,610
So if we want to make plots you need the
long form of the data and

129
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,520
when we get to mixed models and GE models,
you'll be using the long form of the data.
