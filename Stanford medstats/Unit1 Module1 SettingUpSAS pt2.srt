00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,870
Welcome back.
Now that you have Sas set up,

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,610
there are a few things that you need to do
to customize it.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,760
Let's start by clicking on tools, and
selecting options.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,860
>> Under general, go to recent files menu
and set the number of items to 15.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,900
>> Then go to project view.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,040
Make sure the last three are selected.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,160
In particular, make sure to select the
display full path of data and

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,140
reference files.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,240
>> Go to project recovery and change the
save interval to 5 minutes.

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,140
That way, if SAS accidentally crashes,

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,880
you'll have something saved from five
minutes ago automatically.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,400
>> Then go to custom code under tasks.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,100
>> Where it says insert custom code before
task,

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,830
click edit and add ODS Graphics On.

15
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,610
Just click here and type it in.

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,640
Make sure to include a semi-colon at the
end and then click save.

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,550
Where it says insert custom code after
task,

18
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,670
do the same thing except type ODS Graphics
Auth and then a semicolon.

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,230
Click save.

20
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,720
Make sure that these two boxes are
checked.

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,760
What this will do, is itâ€™ll add nicer
graphics whenever you add.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,390
Then click OK.

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,360
These settings should be saved every time
you open up SAS.
