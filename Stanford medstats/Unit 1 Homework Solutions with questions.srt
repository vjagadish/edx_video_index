1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,569
For this first problem on the first
homework assignment we're provided with

2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:09,932
a table that we're going to spend a few
questions dissecting.

3
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:13,409
So, we really should first understand what
this table what kind of

4
00:00:13,409 --> 00:00:16,800
information this table's giving us.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,360
On the left hand side here, we have all
the different values in our data set.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,440
So, you can think of the,

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,260
about this as a list of all the distinct
values in our data set.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:26,780
Okay, and

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:31,740
these are associated with relative
frequencies on the right hand side.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,740
So, what is this really saying?

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:38,230
This is saying that in our data set, we
have 11 showing up 10 different times.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:45,470
So, that's going to be looking something
like 11, 11, 11, ten times.

13
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,840
And then we're going to have 12 nine
times.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,720
That's going to be 12, 12, 12.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:56,070
Now usually it's not all organized this
way from in, in, in ascending order.

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,110
But that's how it's presented here in this
table.

17
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,370
Sort of a, a, a summary of our data.

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,395
So, the first question is asking us to
calculate the mean.

19
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:12,606
Okay, and the way we're going to do that
[SOUND] is we're going to use a short cut.

20
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:15,650
So, we know we have 11 ten times.

21
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,554
So, rather than writing out 11 plus 11
plus 11 plus 11,

22
00:01:18,554 --> 00:01:21,603
we're going to do ten times 11, okay?

23
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:25,440
We're going to do the same thing for each
of these outcomes.

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:33,776
So, we're going to do 9 times 12 plus 11
times 13, et cetera.

25
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:38,390
All the way until we get to 6 times 16,
okay?

26
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,868
And this is all divided by the total
number of data points in our data set,

27
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:46,390
which is 60.

28
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,575
So, this is all going to be divided by 60
and

29
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:54,480
that's going to work out to be 13.4, okay.

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,662
So, the answer to the first question which
asks us

31
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:04,460
about the mean of the sample data is 13.4.

32
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,587
In the next question we're asked about the
standard deviation, and

33
00:02:07,587 --> 00:02:10,926
in order to calculate the standard
deviation what we're going to need to do

34
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:15,662
is remember what the formula for the
standard deviation was.

35
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:18,570
And so let me start out by first writing
that formula.

36
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,560
So let's see I'll do it over here.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,555
The standard deviation notated as SD here
is equal to

38
00:02:24,555 --> 00:02:29,688
the square root of the sum of this
expression.

39
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:37,185
The number in your data set minus the mean
in your data set squared over n minus 1.

40
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:39,842
Now we know that n is equal to 60.

41
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:44,217
Okay, we have 60 numbers in our data set
and

42
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:51,040
we also just calculated the mean to be
13.4.

43
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,625
So, we have these pieces these components
so let's plug them into our formula here.

44
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:05,087
So, let's see, so 60 and 13.4, okay.

45
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:07,793
And, so what I'm going to do is write out
the first few

46
00:03:07,793 --> 00:03:11,321
expressions here in the numerator.

47
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:14,534
The whole thing is in the written
solutions provided to you on

48
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:16,536
the class website.

49
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:21,715
So, for those who want to see the whole
thing I would encourage you to look there.

50
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:29,581
So, what I'm going to do is

51
00:03:30,823 --> 00:03:40,345
write out this expression,

52
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:47,026
okay.

53
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:52,349
And you might have noticed that I did
something wrong here, okay?

54
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:53,571
What did I do wrong?

55
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:59,420
Well, if you think about what our data set
really looks like, it has ten 11's, right?

56
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,780
I said that before.

57
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,492
So, we can't just have one expression that
has 11 minus the mean of our data set,

58
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:09,790
we need ten of those.

59
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,890
So, what we're going to do is multiple
this by ten and similarly we're going to

60
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:21,902
multiple this by 9 because there are 12
nines in our full data set.

61
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:27,430
So, yes so I'll multiply the last one by
six as well.

62
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,470
And doing out this calculation, we're
going to get 148 on the top divided by

63
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:38,480
59 in denominator and that's going to
leave us with 1.58.

64
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,808
So, the answer to the question is 1.58,

65
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:47,190
the standard deviation of our data is
1.58.

66
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,604
The next part of the question asks us
about the median value of our data.

67
00:04:51,604 --> 00:04:52,119
Okay?
So,

68
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:56,390
the median if you remember, is the middle
number in our data set.

69
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,656
Okay?
So, the first step

70
00:04:57,656 --> 00:04:59,822
whenever you're thinking about the median
or

71
00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:04,990
the interquartile range, is to arrange the
numbers in your data set in order.

72
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,754
Okay?
And this can be in increasing or

73
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:09,790
decreasing but you need to have them in
order.

74
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,210
Fortunately for us it's already presented
in that way.

75
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,360
Okay?
This is in, ascending order here, and

76
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,569
we know that we have 60 data points in our
data set.

77
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,089
So, the middle value or

78
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:29,556
the median is going to be between the 30th
and the 31st values.

79
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:30,195
Okay?
So,

80
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:35,530
how do I know what value is the 30th and
what value is the 31st?

81
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,454
If I don't write them out and order them.

82
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:40,394
Well, I know the first ten numbers are
supposed to be 11, and

83
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:44,522
then I know the next nine are supposed to
be 12, right?

84
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:47,680
So, the 19th number is going to be 12.

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,321
So, then if I add 11 to that I know that
the 30th number is going to be 13.

86
00:05:55,321 --> 00:06:00,370
Okay, then I'm going to get 14, the 31st
number is going to be 14.

87
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:05,945
In fact the next 14 numbers are going to
be 14 because of that right there.

88
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:08,200
So, what is the median?

89
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:15,550
The median is the average of these two, so
13 plus 14 divided by 2.

90
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,090
The median in this case is 13.5.

91
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,520
Right, moving on to the inner quartile
range.

92
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,801
So, again, the first step would be to
order our data.

93
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:29,447
Fortunately for us, it's already ordered.

94
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:36,793
Okay, we know that the median or the 50th
percentile, remember those are the same.

95
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:40,783
The 50th, the value at the 50th
percentile, lies between the 30th and

96
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:43,235
31st number, right.

97
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:46,212
From the problem before, we know that
that's the case.

98
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:51,819
So, that means that, the 25th percentile
and the 75th percentile, okay,

99
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:57,820
are going to reside between the 15th and
16th numbers.

100
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,708
And the 75th percentile's going to lie
between the 45th and

101
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:06,149
the 46th numbers, okay.

102
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:07,827
And what is that going to be?

103
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:11,670
This is going to be 12, because we know
that the first ten numbers are going to be

104
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:16,580
11, and the next nine are 12, so that
includes the 12th number.

105
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:24,712
And then we want to look at the 45th and
the 46th number, okay.

106
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:29,100
And that's going to be 15, right here.

107
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,230
It's actually easier if you work backwards
from 60, okay to do that calculation, but

108
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,500
that's going to be 15.

109
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,840
And the reason why we're interested in the
25th and 75th percentiles here,

110
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,990
is that the IQR is equal to the 75th
percentile minus the 25th percentile.

111
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,040
Okay?
So, that's going to be 15 minus 12,

112
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,340
giving us an IQR of 3.

113
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,646
So, this last part of the first question
asks us to correctly identify

114
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,780
the histogram that's associated with the
data in our table.

115
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,489
So, looking at the answer choices very
quickly, and

116
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:11,097
I think it's immediately obvious that B is
not the answer, okay.

117
00:08:11,097 --> 00:08:14,293
So, B shows that the frequencies are equal
across all

118
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,540
the different respiratory rates.

119
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,213
And that's certainly not the case here,
all these numbers are not equal, okay.

120
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:24,268
So, we can quickly eliminate B.

121
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:28,780
If you look at C closely, there's actually
a bar at 17,

122
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:37,100
and we do not have a 17 an outcome that is
17 in our data set, okay?

123
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,300
If there was a 17 here, there'd be the
number zero there.

124
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,510
So, C does not make sense, leaving us with
answer choice A.

125
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,253
So, moving onto question two of the
homework, question two is

126
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:56,708
showing us a table that's similar to the
table shown in question one.

127
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:00,614
There're only two different outcomes here
with outcomes on the left and

128
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:05,907
frequency shown on the right, and it's a
100 in this case, okay.

129
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:09,590
So lets look at what the questions are
asking us to do.

130
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,600
The first part asks us to calculate the
mean of our sample.

131
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,279
Okay?
So, again let's think about how to

132
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,160
read this.

133
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:23,160
So, this is saying that in our data set,
zero occurs 53 times.

134
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,900
So there's going to be 53 zeros here.

135
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,508
And then there's going to be 47 ones
following that, for

136
00:09:29,508 --> 00:09:33,945
a total of 100 values in our data set,
okay.

137
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:38,527
So, the mean is simply going to be the sum
of all those values divided by

138
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:43,165
the number of numbers in our data set.

139
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:48,630
And so that's going to be equal to 53
times zero.

140
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,734
Right, which seems silly to do because
this is

141
00:09:52,734 --> 00:10:00,400
just equal to 0 plus 47 times 1 divided by
100, okay.

142
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,220
And so the mean is going to be equal to
.47.

143
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,360
The second part of this question asks us
to calculate the standard deviation of

144
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,130
this data set.

145
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,042
And so again, the first step is to
remember what the formula for

146
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:16,280
the standard deviation is.

147
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,791
So I'll write that out one more time.

148
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:24,962
It's the summation of the expression shown
here, okay.

149
00:10:24,962 --> 00:10:33,560
And so n is the number of values in our
data set so that's going to be 100.

150
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:40,299
The mean we just calculate it to be 0.47,
okay.

151
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:44,875
So, let me clean this up a little bit and

152
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:50,512
rewrite that expression here.

153
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:53,379
All right, and the in contrast to previous
examples,

154
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:56,612
this is actually going to be a shorter
expression to write out,

155
00:10:56,612 --> 00:11:01,590
because there are only two distinct values
in our data set.

156
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,200
And I'll show you what I mean in a second.

157
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,580
So, we have 0 minus .47 squared plus 1
minus 0.47 squared.

158
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,986
And that's it because we only have two
values, i equals 1 here and

159
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:21,770
i equals 2 here, and that is all I equals.

160
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,110
The issue is that zero shows up 53 times.

161
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,720
So, we really should be doing this
calculation 53 times.

162
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,640
So, what I'm going to do is add a 53 in
front of there,

163
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,930
basically multiplying it by 53, and
multiply this by 47 as well.

164
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,260
Now, remember when you were calculating
the mean,

165
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:47,750
you might have said, okay, 53 times 0, I
don't have to do that, that's just 0.

166
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,674
In this case you do have to do this
because 0 minus 0.47.

167
00:11:52,674 --> 00:11:54,916
Okay, so it's, it's negative 0.47 squared,
so

168
00:11:54,916 --> 00:12:00,400
that's going to give you a number and
affect your standard deviation estimate.

169
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,890
So, don't just ignore the zero this time.

170
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,510
Okay, that's a common mistake.

171
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,130
So, this is all going to be divided by 99.

172
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:14,735
And then if you do have this calculation
it simplifies to 24.91 over 99,

173
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:20,140
which okay, which simplifies to 0.502.

174
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:29,240
Alright, so the standard deviation here is
0.502.

175
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,630
So, what is the median value in this data
set?

176
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,620
Well, the median value in any data set is
the middle number, okay?

177
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,545
And the middle number here, we know, well,
so, we know that there's 100 numbers here.

178
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:44,575
So, we know that the middle number is
represented by the average of the 50th and

179
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:47,004
the 51st number, okay.

180
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:50,538
And remember to order your data in what,
either increasing or

181
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:56,660
decreasing order but you need to order
your data in order for this to make sense.

182
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,867
So thankfully here it's already ordered.

183
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:04,080
It wouldn't be too hard to do since there
are only two values anyway.

184
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,668
But so you could imagine that the first 53
numbers in

185
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:15,210
your data set are going to be zero, and
then the 54th number is going to be one.

186
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,029
Okay?
So if this is the 54th number, 53, 52, 51,

187
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:25,000
50 we see that the average of 0 and 0 is
just 0.

188
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,190
So the median here is 0.

189
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,370
Great, so this piggybacks on to the next
question which is asking for

190
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,410
the interquartile range.

191
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:39,466
For it, to calculate the interquartile
range, okay, we're going to need to know

192
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:47,194
the number at the 75th percentile minus
the number at the 25th percentile, okay.

193
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:52,654
So, we calculated the number at the 50th
percentile it would you could gather

194
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:57,646
that the number at the 75th percentile
would be the average of the 75th and

195
00:13:57,646 --> 00:14:02,413
76th numbers in our data set.

196
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:06,648
And similarly the 25th, the number at the
25th percentile would be

197
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:11,480
the numbers between the 25th and the 26th
numbers.

198
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,150
And so we know that this is going to be
zero and that is this going

199
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:26,600
to be one because of this relation and I
will keep reiterating that.

200
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,782
But basically we're going to do 1 minus 0.

201
00:14:28,782 --> 00:14:36,200
The interquartile range is the glamorous
number of 1.

202
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,738
For the third question on this homework,
we're provided with table 1,

203
00:14:39,738 --> 00:14:44,319
which is an excerpt from a paper published
in JAMA recently.

204
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,008
So, the first part of this third questions
asks us what type of variable is

205
00:14:50,008 --> 00:14:52,288
the variable age.?

206
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:54,525
Okay So there's some clues here.

207
00:14:54,525 --> 00:15:00,383
So, age is reported with the median in the
interquartile range and

208
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:05,330
the units here are given as y.

209
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:10,874
So, age in years, this is a continuous
variable because it's giving us years and

210
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:16,583
it's reported with the median
interquartile range.

211
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,426
We know, or, or the author, we know that
the authors believe that age is not

212
00:15:20,426 --> 00:15:26,650
normally distributed because they report
the median and the interquartile range.

213
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:32,300
That's a very standard practice if age was
normally distributed.

214
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,830
The mean and the standard deviation are
usually reported.

215
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:41,298
The next question asks us about the
variable below that, okay.

216
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:44,650
Age greater than or equal to 75 years.

217
00:15:45,872 --> 00:15:49,930
This is going to be a binary variable.

218
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,301
It's either going to be yes, older than or
greater than or

219
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:59,020
equal to 75 or no, less than 75, okay.

220
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,080
So, this is a binary variable, probably
coded as 1, 0.

221
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:11,125
The third question asks us what
statistical measures are used to

222
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:17,090
describe the central tendency and
variability of the age variable.

223
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,933
So, I already pointed this out, earlier
when we were discussing this,

224
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:27,130
but, it's reported with the median in the
interquartile range as indicated here.

225
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,000
The statistics used to describe age
greater than or

226
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,908
equal to 75 years is n and percentages,
okay.

227
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:41,790
So, this is the percentages of this end,
essentially.

228
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:46,850
So, 562 represents 17% of this overall
cohort of 32,

229
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,910
about 33 hundred people and 592 represents
about 18% of

230
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:59,630
this overall cohort of again, about 3,300
people.

231
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:05,590
The next three questions ask us to, gather
some values from this table.

232
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:10,260
So, the first one is asking us what the
median weight of the placebo group is.

233
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:15,080
So, we're immediately our attention is
drawn to this column, okay.

234
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,600
And then we want to find the weight
variable.

235
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,045
We notice that it's given, the median is
reported, okay.

236
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:26,900
So, the median in this case is going to be
81, specifically, 81 kilograms.

237
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,475
What is the percent of participants in the
ranolazine, I'm not sure if

238
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:38,091
I'm pronouncing that right, in the, in the
drug group basically, okay.

239
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,941
So, you notice it says female sex here,
and

240
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:44,841
that's the percentage of the participants
who are female,

241
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:50,710
which means that about 66% of those
participants are male.

242
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:55,206
The next question asks us about the number
or

243
00:17:55,206 --> 00:18:01,010
the percentage of participants rather in
the placebo group who have hypertension.

244
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,474
So, again, we're going to go and

245
00:18:02,474 --> 00:18:06,561
find the hypertension row here, which is
in the co-morbidity section, and we see

246
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:13,000
that the percentage of the patients in the
placebo group with hypertension is 73.9%.

247
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,997
The next part of this question is asking
us to

248
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:21,070
calculate how many binary variables are
shown, okay.

249
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:26,450
So, the trick here is to look at how these
variables are reported.

250
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,450
If there's a fraction, if there's a
percentage reported for

251
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,550
a certain variable, you can assume that
it's binary, okay.

252
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,830
And that's because when there are two
levels,

253
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,290
if you know the percentage here this one's
going,

254
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:43,840
just going to be 100 just minus the
percentage given in the other category.

255
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:51,240
That's why there are no like second level
or third level values reported here.

256
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,932
So, to get back to the question, all the
variables with percentages reported,

257
00:18:55,932 --> 00:19:00,762
our fractions here, are age grid equals
75, female sex, white race diabetes,

258
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:07,916
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, whether
you're a current smoker or not.

259
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,918
History of prior MI history of prior
coronary revascularization and

260
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:14,060
prior heart failure.

261
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:19,855
The last part of this first homework
question asks you to identify the box

262
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:28,310
plot that represents the distribution of
each in the placebo group.

263
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,390
So, we look at the placebo group.

264
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,430
Whoops, I just covered what I needed to
show you.

265
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,590
So, we look at the placebo group, and

266
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:40,190
we see that the median is 64 with an
interquartile range of 56 to 72.

267
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,971
Okay.
So, for a box plot, the,

268
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:46,707
the interquartile range, this is really
going to be really informative, so,

269
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:53,170
you're going to want to pick the box plot
that looks like a boxy part.

270
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:57,250
So, this, this represents the
interquartile range here,

271
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,756
I just overshot that.

272
00:19:59,756 --> 00:20:04,635
So, the box here represents the
interquartile range.

273
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:08,460
So, you're going to want to pick the box
where it looks like it ray,

274
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,510
ranges from 56 to 72, and that's going to
be answer B.

275
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:18,494
So, you might have thought that C could
also be the answer because it

276
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:24,730
satisfies that criteria of the
interquartile range.

277
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,546
But, there's another piece of information
here,

278
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:33,561
which is captured in this variable, aged
greater than or equal to 75 years Okay.

279
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:37,133
So, 18% of our cohort is older than 75.

280
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:41,117
It's unlikely that the maximum age is 75
years exactly and

281
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:46,180
that's what's shown in box plot c, which
further sort of lends, which,

282
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:54,410
which further provides evidence for the
fact that B is the correct answer.
