00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,710
Welcome to our final online module for HRP
223.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,330
This week we're going to cover
Comprehensive Example and

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,912
we'll incorporate most of the code you've
learned during this cover.

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,226
>> By covering everything all at once, we
hope you'll be a little bit

5
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:14,150
more comfortable by the time you have to
go out and work on data sets on your own.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,970
For this unit we created a fake data set
about diabetes.

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,900
Before taking a look at our data
dictionary please pause the video and

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,890
download the Diabetes 223.csv data set
that goes along with this

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,990
comprehensive example.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,819
Save it in the folder you created for this
class.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,190
Remember, whenever you get a data set,

12
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,600
always make sure you have a data
dictionary.

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,330
Here's the data dictionary for our data
set.

14
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:42,050
>> The main variable is this binary
variable that represents

15
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,520
the disease outcome for each subject.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,140
If they have a one they are diabetic, and
if they have a zero they are not diabetic.

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,630
We have variables for age in years, weight
in pounds and height in centimeters.

18
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,110
These are all continuous variables.

19
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,317
We also have some categorical variables.

20
00:00:58,317 --> 00:01:02,786
Race ethnicity has five categories, 1 for
black, 2 for white, 3 for asian, 4 for

21
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:04,380
hispanic and five for other.

22
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,698
Smoking status is a binary variable with 1
representing smoker and

23
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:12,040
0 representing non smoker.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,160
We also have a gender variable labelled
isfemale, with 1 for

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,910
females and 0 for males.

26
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,680
>> A great place to start before even
opening SAS,

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
is to make sure that you know the
variables in your data set.

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,170
Make sure you know which of the variables
are continuous, which are binary,

29
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,950
which are categorical, and etcetera.

30
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,110
Usually makes things easier when you
import the data set, and

31
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,130
are checking the define field attributes
window.

32
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,820
>> Let's open SAS and point to a permanent
library.

33
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,200
As you may recall, during the first few
modules,

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,170
we showed you how to use point and click
to create a permanent library.

35
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,930
We also recommended that you copy the code
located in the SAS log, so

36
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,660
that you could use it in the future.

37
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,260
We still have our library creating code,
so we'll start by creating a new program,

38
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:01,850
labeling it Library, and then pasting in
our live reference code.

39
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,280
Once we run this, we'll be able to import
our data.

40
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,420
Let's click on File > Import Data, and
navigate to the Diabetes 223 data set.

41
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,890
On the next page you can specify which
library you want to import your data into.

42
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,310
Now you want to save it into the permanent
library that we just created.

43
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:29,518
So click browse to find that library, and
click Save.

44
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:33,910
When you're done specifying your library,
click Next.

45
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,800
Make sure to check the box that says file
contains field names on record number one,

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,830
like we have here.

47
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,480
Also make sure to check the box for

48
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,760
renaming columns to comply with SAS naming
conventions.

49
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,420
This can fix any simple formatting errors
that might mess up SAS.

50
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,700
Click Next.

51
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,740
On the next page,

52
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,270
check to make sure that each variable is
being imported in their correct format.

53
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,584
We need to make sure that all of our
numeric variables are listed as number,

54
00:02:58,584 --> 00:03:01,229
and all of our categorical variables are
listed as string.

55
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:06,537
[SOUND]

56
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:13,969
Great.

57
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:17,286
Now our variables are all correctly
specified.

58
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:22,360
Now click finish and you'll be able to
input your data set
