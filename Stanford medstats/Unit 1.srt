00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:11,130
Welcome to CSI Medical Errors or case
studies in medical errors.

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,420
My name is Dr. Steve Chen and I'm the
director of accreditation, quality and

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,260
safety at Stanford Hospital and Clinics.

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,020
I will be the presenter for the material
in this continuum medical education

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,650
program, reviewing medical error events
and lessons learned.

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,240
This program is sponsored by an education
grant provided by the Pfizer Corporation.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,068
The objective of this three hour program
is to integrate national patient safety

8
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:42,967
goals, requirements in clinical practice
in areas of patient identification,

9
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:48,400
Universal Protocol, medication labeling,
and medication reconciliation.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,365
Second objective is to develop practical
skills to improve team work and

11
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:56,980
communication among healthcare providers
and apply them to prevent medical errors

12
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,240
and at the time when medical events occur,
that is, immediate feedback.

13
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,130
The third objective is to evaluate root
causes and

14
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:10,300
contributing factors that lead to various
medical errors and the fourth objective is

15
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,100
to develop skills to apply to practice the
appropriate procedures or

16
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,560
steps to assure that such such events are
prevented in the future.

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,348
This course will accomplish these
objectives by

18
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:23,564
presenting four different real life case
scenarios and give you a sense of

19
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:28,470
the work that goes on behind the scenes
whenever a medical error occurs.

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,278
The goal of this course is to give you
information that you can use in

21
00:01:32,278 --> 00:01:35,882
your clinical practice so that you will
minimize the chances of

22
00:01:35,882 --> 00:01:38,990
having such an event happen to you and
your patients.

23
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,684
To start this course off,

24
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:44,800
I wanted to share a video clip from a
medical error experience.

25
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,019
In 1998, the institute of medicine
provided a report called,

26
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:58,456
To Err is Human, and in that report
estimated that there were

27
00:01:58,456 --> 00:02:03,460
98,000 lives lost attributed to medical
error.

28
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,555
Without a doubt,

29
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:09,300
this is a significant healthcare issue
first publicized in this report, and

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,810
since then we have learned multiple things
associated with medical errors.

31
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,630
When a medical error occurs,

32
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,590
there are a number of other ramification
that rises as a result.

33
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,340
They all take one's energy or focus and
may include the following.

34
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,666
Disclosure to patient and or family.

35
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,360
Personal reputation.

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,070
Personal confidence.

37
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,240
Time, energy, and cost to be involved in
the follow up investigation.

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,070
Time, energy and cost to be involved in a
lawsuit.

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,850
Reporting to medical liability, licensing
and National Practitioners Data Bank.

40
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,410
Disclosure that will have to be done for
future faculty, hospital and

41
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,680
health plan application.

42
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,360
So, without a doubt, there are certainly
huge ramification associate whenever one

43
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,449
is involved in such a medical event.

44
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:07,170
The human cost, you know, when you
actually look at it, actually is enormous.

45
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,400
Healthcare costs have been rising for
several years.

46
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,474
Costs for technology, pharmaceutical,
infrastructure and

47
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:17,570
staff have been discussed at both
professional and government levels.

48
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,680
In the past decade, more focus has been
applied to the cost attributed to

49
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,369
medical errors and health care acquired
conditions.

50
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,050
Another factor that has not been

51
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,720
considered has been the human causes
associated with these events.

52
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,180
One would recognize the patient and

53
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,530
their family as having been effected by a
medical error, but

54
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,280
what about the second victim, which would
include the involved care providers?

55
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,450
Each of us clinicians go through a
training program that hopefully prepares

56
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,910
to deal with clinical challenges and less
than desirable outcomes.

57
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,968
In some cases, that may even mean dealing
with a patient's death.

58
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:54,720
The monetary side, for the second victim,
can vary significantly.

59
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,026
I'd been involved with such cases, such as
a patient's suicide,

60
00:03:58,026 --> 00:04:01,912
where a licensed clinical social worker,
who had been working in her career for

61
00:04:01,912 --> 00:04:06,980
only two years, quit the profession after
hearing what had happened to her patient.

62
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,340
She never returned to healthcare.

63
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,130
In the old days,

64
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,690
we used to say that a person did not have
the right stuff to do this work.

65
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,870
And deserved to be out of healthcare.

66
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,890
The reality is,

67
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,420
that very few of us are ever prepared to
deal with this significant patient event.

68
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,090
Courses like this, is here to inform you
that medical errors do occur and

69
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,550
may occur with such frequency that it's
inevitable sometime in your career,

70
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,000
a bad thing will happen to one of your
patients.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,485
The concept of healthcare acquired
conditions or HAC are events that occur to

72
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:43,470
patients that are complications, that in
the past, have been tolerated.

73
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,220
Since third party and government pairs
were compensated,

74
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,770
the healthcare organization for additional
services provided to manage these events.

75
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,870
With healthcare reform, this is no longer
the case.

76
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,872
Hospitals that have patients develop
healthcare acquired conditions are no

77
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:01,150
longer reimbursed for those services or
days in the hospital.

78
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,750
Effective the day that these conditions
were identified.

79
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,369
The results are the following: longer
length of stay,

80
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:11,757
more patient dissatisfaction, more cost of
care,

81
00:05:11,757 --> 00:05:16,531
more chances to develop additional
healthcare-acquired conditions,

82
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:20,810
more administrator costs, more external
oversight.

83
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,060
Organizations are not getting reimbursed.

84
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,510
And when you look at this particular slide
and see that a good number of these

85
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,480
events are not only attributed to actually
things that occur in the hospital.

86
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,440
There are also a huge number of items that
occur outside of the hospital.

87
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,262
So, at what point do we draw that line in
the sand in terms of

88
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:43,170
tolerating these events?

89
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,590
That if you followed the Chinese
philosopher, Lao Tzu,

90
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,775
if you do not change direction, you may
end up where you are heading, and

91
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:55,950
that certainly is the case for healthcare.
