1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,430
In this next case study,

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:14,058
we're going to actually spend a little bit
of time talking about a situation where,.

3
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:23,060
A pre-operative or procedure room set up.

4
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,320
Patient was already brought into the room,
and was on the table.

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,360
The anesthesiologist was chatting with the
patient, having a great conversation.

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,120
The anesthesiologist went ahead to hook up
the patient to the EKG monitor,

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,460
get the pulse oximeter clip on the
patients finger.

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,840
Got the temperature.

9
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,330
The monitor on the patients forehead.

10
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,370
And basically just having a great
conversation with

11
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,910
the patient who's there to have.

12
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,520
A surgical procedure.

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:04,740
The plan was to have a general anesthesia
and so the patient, anesthesiologist just

14
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,139
prior to the patient being brought into
the room was having all the meds drawn up.

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,150
Loaded in the syringes recapped.

16
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,960
You know, basically at their work table
area,

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,750
by the head of the table all good to go.

18
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,540
The patient was right there and he went
ahead and

19
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,609
gave the pre operative antibiotic.

20
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,590
Which was a hospital initiative,

21
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,150
designed to reduce the chances of
post-operative, surgical site infection.

22
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,960
The anesthesiologist continued to have
this conversation with the, patient.

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,230
But after a few minute, noticed the
patient was no longer.

24
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,850
Responding to any of his verbal command.

25
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:57,750
The patient basically was lying still, not
moving.

26
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,380
The pulse oximeter started to go off.

27
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,910
The the alarm started to ring a little
bit.

28
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:11,620
Basically it indicated for whatever reason
the patient wasn't really oxygenating.

29
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,504
Anesthesiologist was starting to think,
you know this patient must be having some

30
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:21,256
sort of reaction to the antibiotic he'd
just given, and started administering some

31
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:25,492
medication to respond to the suspected
allergic reaction.

32
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:29,361
The anesthesiologist got really concerned
because the patient wasn't responding to

33
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:32,120
any of those medication and basically was
not ventilating.

34
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,620
The anesthesiologist started a process to
manually ventilate the patient and

35
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,545
then over a 20 minute well, 15,

36
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:46,121
20 minutes worth of time, the patient
started to breathe on her own.

37
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:50,580
In this situation, if you were the quality
officer or

38
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,470
patient office what do you think was
actually going on in this situation?

39
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,460
It was interesting that after we had a
chance to review the event,

40
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,510
and actually spoke to the patient
afterwards.

41
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,090
It was interesting, the patient described
this helplessness feeling,

42
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,869
where the patient was not able to move a
single muscle.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,460
Almost as if they were kind of, paralysed
or, or frozen.

44
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:27,500
The, patient indicated that couldn't move
their mouth, their eyes couldn't focus.

45
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,600
But the interesting thing in this patient,

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,530
was that the patient was able to hear
everything that was going on in the room.

47
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,960
At the time when this event occurred.

48
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,810
It was a little discerning because you
heard a lot of commotion and

49
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,618
a lot of language that could have been
considered a little on the.

50
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:50,078
Hostile or foul side, but the fact of the
matter is that she couldn't respond to any

51
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:55,538
of the questions the doctor was asking and
couldn't tell them about you know,

52
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:59,984
how much actual pain she was enduring
because they were, you know,

53
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:03,560
they were poking her and try to ventilate
her.

54
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,730
Even though she was unable to do that
herself.

55
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,670
Well, the end result of this was that, you
know,

56
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,180
what was uncovered was that the patient
probably endured a.

57
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,130
Paralytic medication reaction.

58
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:26,440
Patient actually didn't get the antibiotic
is probably what ended up happening.

59
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,190
When the review was done it was found that
the anesthesiologist and

60
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,840
the team that's involved with, you know,
setting up that room,.

61
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,540
Never label the syringes.

62
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,760
They drop several medications, you know,

63
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,780
and those of you in anesthesia, you know,
you've got your muscle relaxants,

64
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,520
your paralytics, you've got your
sedatives, you know, your narcotics.

65
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,430
You know, and, and so, and plus in this
situation, he had the antibiotic.

66
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,517
If they're given out a sequence, or at a
timing when you are not ready for

67
00:04:59,517 --> 00:05:04,190
it, it creates, workflow variations and
potential heart patients harm.

68
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:08,556
In this situation, he would, the factor
that was

69
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:13,447
identified that clearly that the labeling
of syringes wasn't done.

70
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:18,270
And so, because of some other activity
that was going in the room.

71
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,755
The anesthesiologist was a bit distracted
with some of the commotion that was

72
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:27,585
going on, and as a result the distraction
led to them grabbing the wrong syringe and

73
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:31,760
administering the wrong medication at the
wrong time.

74
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,930
As we spoke before,

75
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:39,010
some of the other factors that also played
in this case were issues of fatigue.

76
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,350
This was a procedure that was later in the
day.

77
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:49,370
Anesthesiologist and the anesthesia tech,
actually had, been working

78
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,400
started actually a little earlier that
morning because of some other, activities,

79
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,280
and case load that was going on, so there
was a bit of fatigue that was involved.

80
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,040
The usual production pressure, was a, it's
another factor.

81
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,840
The environment.

82
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,860
The issue, what was kind of interesting
was that the lighting was.

83
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,790
Turned down.

84
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,630
And it was a bit noisy.

85
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,550
There was a preference on the part of the
surgical team to

86
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,090
have certain music playing, as they're in
the process of setting it up and

87
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,160
that added to a little bit more
distraction.

88
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,760
And when the lighting's down a little bit,
they don't all see clearly what it

89
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,260
is that they're actually grabbing, you
know, from their anesthesia work area.

90
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,958
So, you know, all these things, you know,

91
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:37,147
we talked about team training, team
communication, teamwork, and

92
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:42,130
culture are all factors that contributed
to this particular event to occur.

93
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,290
You know, what's,

94
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:49,990
what was interesting about this was that,
the thought that a paralytic reaction.

95
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,644
To the medication that was administered
really wasn't, you know,

96
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:57,865
considered until that interview of the
patient who basically said, you know,

97
00:06:57,865 --> 00:07:00,170
this is what happened and this what I
felt.

98
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,290
You know, I was.

99
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,340
Quite aware of everything that's going on
because you know,

100
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,310
my ears was hearing and my brain was
working.

101
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,814
But I could not move a muscle.

102
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:16,030
Or you know, move my mouth to save my
life, to tell you what was going on.

103
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,800
So be aware of these events.

104
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,238
Can occur, they do occur.

105
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:23,904
But there could be some steps we could put
in place,

106
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:28,930
to be able to prevent these kind of things
from happening, again in the future.

107
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,653
Some of the lessons learned from this
event, is that and

108
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:38,510
even the Joint Commission, had recognized
that this is a possibility, that the.

109
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,435
Wrong medication could be given to a
patient or

110
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:45,927
the medication is given at an
inappropriate time or at the wrong time.

111
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:50,895
So one of the National Patient Safety
Goals that Joint Commission requires of

112
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:55,680
hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers
requires that any secondary.

113
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,530
Container, such as a syringe, a basin,

114
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,070
a secondary container needs to be labeled
with its content.

115
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,020
Even if you were going to get some saline
irrigation with

116
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,710
some antibiotic mixed into it, you know,
it needs to be labeled with its content.

117
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,570
If the medication is not immediately used.

118
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,200
Used or administered into a patient.

119
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,360
What we talk, what we're talking about
immediate use, immediate administration.

120
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,240
We're actually talking about drawing the
medication up and actually, you know,

121
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,840
putting it into a port or directly
administering into a patient or

122
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,820
using that to immediately irrigate a.

123
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,240
A, a wound.

124
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,940
What, you know, it basically means not to
be drawn up and then put aside, you know,

125
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,390
for a few seconds, or a few minutes, or a
few hours before it's actually used.

126
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,485
So Joint Commission requires that if
you're going to be drawing something up or

127
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:53,808
pouring something out,

128
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:58,218
you know, into another container, unless
you're actually using it right away,

129
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:02,790
the thought process is, is that, that
container needs to be labeled.

130
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,030
Needs to be marked with what it's content
is.

131
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:09,300
Another factor is that distractions have
been shown to

132
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,410
be a significant factor in medication
errors in general.

133
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,410
Most of the work that's.

134
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,226
Come out of the research associated with
this,

135
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:21,322
actually comes out of mostly the nursing
literature because nurses for

136
00:09:21,322 --> 00:09:25,737
the most part in healthcare setting are
the primary profession.

137
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:30,260
That's actually involved in the
administering medication of patients.

138
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,135
They have learned that many times being
distracted momentarily for

139
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:38,772
that split second is enough to cause a
mediation error.

140
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:42,472
And so some of the initiatives that
organizations have

141
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:45,654
implemented including Stanford, you know,

142
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:50,520
are things like the little red lights
that's on the mobile computer.

143
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,769
That.
When the little red flashing light is on

144
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:55,919
it means the person that's in, who's
handling the cart is

145
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,455
involved with a medication administration
and that they should not be interrupted or

146
00:10:00,455 --> 00:10:02,877
someone come up to them and ask a
question.

147
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:05,134
Because that actually is distracting, and

148
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:09,400
when you have distraction that could lead
to medication error.

149
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,490
In other health systems, and you might.

150
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,520
See this, you know, when you work at other
hospitals or

151
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,050
if you're on a rotation in another
facility.

152
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,561
They have a zone marked off you know,

153
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:23,940
on the floor where it's basically yellow
tape or red tape.

154
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,410
And if they're in that zone, they're
standing in that area, basically means do

155
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:32,410
not distract me because they are involved
with medication administration process.

156
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,470
Another example of that would be.

157
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,930
And this is seen in the Keiser system as
well as other health system.

158
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,675
Keiser was one organization that was
involved with developing the concept of

159
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:43,850
the sash.

160
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,376
Where, if they're involved with a
medication administration they're wearing

161
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:51,950
this yellow fluorescent sash they are,
that's a sign.

162
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,130
To everybody that they are not to be
interrupted because they are involved with

163
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,310
the medication administration process.

164
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,960
For the physicians, you know, when you're
at the bed side, the table,

165
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,820
the chair side, procedures suites, the
emergency department,

166
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,400
really is like gather, you know, all your
material that you need.

167
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,304
So that you have it readily accessible so
not, someone's not running in and

168
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:18,880
out trying to gather materials or supplies
or medication.

169
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,560
And then if you draw something up, and
then if you draw it up in a syringe and

170
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,340
you end up putting it down, you know,
you're going to need to look at

171
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,630
getting some labels, even though you're
going to pick it up in a minute.

172
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,780
And go ahead and administer that
medication.

173
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,650
The Joint Commission's expectation is not
only if you put it down it

174
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,120
needs to be labeled even if it's only that
one single medication and

175
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,570
it's the only medication that you use.

176
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,380
It really does need to be labeled with the
content.

177
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,380
An example of this might be something like
a plastic or

178
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,590
dermatology clinic where, you may be
having all these.

179
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,002
Syringes drawn up for the day.

180
00:11:56,002 --> 00:12:02,020
Loaded with, you know, lidocaine with 1 to
100000, epinephrine.

181
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,316
You know, it, it's, even if you load up
four or

182
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:07,676
five syringes and that's the only
medication you have in your clinic,

183
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:10,185
the expectation is that from the Joint
Commission.

184
00:12:10,185 --> 00:12:14,090
If they find it they're going to expect it
to be labelled with its content.

185
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:18,400
So I know that there's manufacturers that
have pre-made labels that.

186
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,690
You can actually purchase.

187
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,018
It comes in a roll and you peel them off
and every time you draw up

188
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:26,962
a syringe you label it after you draw it
up with what it's contents are.

189
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:30,790
So that everybody is on the same page and
they know what's in those syringes and

190
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,260
that there's no questions.

191
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,748
So, what are some of the prevention
strategies so

192
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:39,853
that you don't end up having an issue
associated with

193
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:43,976
a wrong medication being administered to
one of your patients.

194
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:48,316
And we talked about this earlier is that
unless the medication is drawn and

195
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:53,380
immediately used, the syringe needs to be
labeled with key information.

196
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,760
This labeling should be legible and
visible.

197
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,440
My suggestion is those pre printed labels.

198
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,120
It's just, there's companies out there
that manufacture these pre printed labels.

199
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,310
They're color coded, and they come in a
roll.

200
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,380
And they're for the most part legible.

201
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,580
I've seen people use, ball point pen.

202
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,420
I've seen markers.

203
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:21,920
And what ends up happening, if they are
not, resistant to,

204
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,150
being wet, they end up smearing.

205
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,750
You have no idea, what you, you know,

206
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,988
what's in there and as a result, it'd be a
set up for a problem.

207
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:33,660
Another prevention strategy, if there's
any doubt about the medication.

208
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,364
Or the container considering doing the
preparation over.

209
00:13:37,364 --> 00:13:41,522
The issue is, is that, you know, you're
relying on the team members to be

210
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:44,450
helping you out and giving you exact what
you need.

211
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,960
You know, it's always worth doing that
double check.

212
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,600
But if nobody is sure about what it is
that's in that syringe and,

213
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,370
you have time to be able to reprepare that
particular medication,

214
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,020
you may want to consider tossing it and
starting all over.

215
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,540
Many of us know that whenever there's an
emergency or.

216
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,615
Urgency situation, it always contributes
to process variation because those create,

217
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:13,680
or, products that will create production
pressure.

218
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,060
because what you're trying to do is, you
know,

219
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,670
urgently, quickly get things taken care
of, get the medication in the patient.

220
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,623
But we all know that if the wrong thing's
put in and you're already dealing with

221
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:28,660
an emergency situation that can definitely
expedite the bad outcome.

222
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,020
So be aware that those emergency and

223
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,630
urgency are production pressure that
causes the need for speed.

224
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,304
And when you got the need for speed and

225
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:39,170
start short cutting things, that's when
bad things happen.

226
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,040
The last prevention strategy that we can
suggest.

227
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,950
Is doing a double check of the label
containers,

228
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,720
a safety strategy that could prevent a bad
outcome.

229
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,620
In some situations, some hospitals
actually tell,

230
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,080
you know, because they're considered high
alert or high risk medication, when

231
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,080
you do a double check, you should have a
double check also independently done.

232
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,580
With another licensed individual and the
concept there is that if one person,

233
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,480
you know, is not looking at it, you know,

234
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,200
carefully, maybe the second person to
validate or confirm.

235
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,530
But that basically means both individual
has to be focused.

236
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,440
Paying attention, independently doing
their own double check so

237
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,550
that by doing this independent double
check it will actually add

238
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,630
the more likelihood that, you know, you've
got the right med for

239
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,750
that patient that you're actually taking
care of.

240
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,260
So the double check is that, really that
pause that you want to take a moment of.

241
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,900
It's like, am I looking at the right
medication for

242
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,340
my patient before I actually look at
administering it?

243
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,045
Now, one of the strategies some
organizations do use because the,

244
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:47,080
the, medication container, is bar coded.

245
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,070
You know, if the bar coding specifically
is for that medication and

246
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,870
the bar coding system is linked to that
order for

247
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,670
that patient, you know, you can actually
use bar coding as the second double.

248
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,853
In other words that you check the patient,
check the medication, the system checks

249
00:16:03,853 --> 00:16:08,233
the medication against the medication
order, and that can function as

250
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:12,900
a double check if you have that system set
up in your particular area.
