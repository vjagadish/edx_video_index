1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,590
Good morning, students.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,200
This is Kaplan-Meier part two.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,780
How to read Kaplan-Meier curves.

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,300
For this video, we are going to look at
two sets of data.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,340
From the actual clinical literature.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,430
So here we go.

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,830
This is the result of a clinical trial
comparing two chemotherapy regimens after

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,270
surgery for colon cancer.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,460
And the two regimens are given here by the
gold and blue lines.

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,998
One is the control arm,

11
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:38,560
5Fu, plus Leucovorin and the other is the
experimental arm

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,710
which is 5Fu plus Leucovorin plus the
experimental drug Oxaliplatin.

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,060
And what is being measure here, is
disease-free survival.

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,320
In other words, the patient has had
surgery and there is no evidence of

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,760
disease following surgery, but of course
there's a risk for recurrence.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,020
And so the patient may have a recurrence.

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,790
So the question is,

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,498
what is the proportion of patients who are
disease-free after surgery.

19
00:01:11,498 --> 00:01:17,720
And the time axis shows data up to four
years following surgery.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,300
Now, the first thing we notice is that the
curves are very smooth.

21
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,650
And in fact, it's a pretty large clinical
trial.

22
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,270
The number of patients enrolled in the,

23
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,370
study are shown here, 1,200, and 1,207
patients in both of, in each of the arms.

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,880
You see a difference between the blue and
the gold curves and

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,600
you want to know whether that's
statistically significant.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,810
That's given here by the P-value of .0034.

27
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,508
So what we need to know is what is the
P-value.

28
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:56,787
Well, the P-value is this,

29
00:01:56,787 --> 00:02:05,076
the P-value equals the probability,

30
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:10,351
that, this result would

31
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:17,650
occur under the null hypothesis.

32
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,780
Null hypothesis, what is that?

33
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,220
The null hypothesis is, the hypothesis
that nothing is going on.

34
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,793
So, the P-value is, .34%, of that,

35
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:41,492
there's a .34% likelihood that what you
see here would have occur

36
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:47,677
with Oxaliplatin actually having added
nothing to the 5Fu Leucovorin, so

37
00:02:47,677 --> 00:02:54,760
the P-value is pretty low so it looks like
this is highly statistically significant.

38
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,299
The usual cutoff for clinical trials is
that something is significant if it

39
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:06,753
has a P-value of less that .05, .05 would
be considered borderline, or .04.

40
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:12,860
So being significantly less than that
suggests that this is good clinical trial.

41
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,920
Now, what is the size of a benefit that's
confirmed by Oxaliplatin.

42
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:26,743
That's given by the hazard ratio so,

43
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:33,342
the hazard ratio [SOUND] is a ratio

44
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:41,910
of hazard rates [SOUND] for the two
groups.

45
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,210
Okay, what is the hazard here?

46
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:56,630
The hazard here, is the hazard that the
disease would recur.

47
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:02,690
And, the way hazard ratio is defined, is
the conventioning, is the numerator,

48
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,150
is the experimental group, and the
denominator is the control group.

49
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:16,080
And the hazard ratio uses all the data
here, calculated by a very clever formula.

50
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,370
Calculated by Cox Proportional Hazards.

51
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,000
And what Cox Proportional Hazards does is
it makes use for

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,580
the fact that there's incomplete
information in this trial.

53
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,410
So, another way of looking at hazard is in
addition

54
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,660
to the Cox proportional hazards, you might
want to explain to your patient, say what,

55
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:54,090
what are the chances that this treatment,
Oxaliplatin, which is not benign at all.

56
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,950
There is significant side effects with
Oxaliplatin,

57
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:02,360
most notably pain and tingling in the
fingers and

58
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,230
toes, which actually can become permanent
in some cases.

59
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,306
So, what what is the likelihood that
you'll actually get

60
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:13,844
benefit from the Oxaliplatin plan in terms
of preventing recurrence of the disease?

61
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:17,200
And you, you could say to the patient,

62
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,183
let's look at the two year mark, and at
the two year mark,

63
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:29,004
the chance that you would remain
disease-free with just 5Fu and Leucovorin,

64
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:34,639
the chance you would remain disease-free
here would be 75%.

65
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,010
[SOUND] However what would be the chance
that you would be,

66
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:46,769
remain disease-free had you added the
Oxaliplatin and

67
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:50,462
that roughly here is about 80%.

68
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:54,851
So, by adding Oxaliplatin, you increase
your

69
00:05:54,851 --> 00:06:00,022
chances of being disease-free from 75% to
80%.

70
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:02,200
So there's a 5% benefit here.

71
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,880
That means that if you

72
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:13,680
take the Oxaliplatin, there's a 5%
improvement in your disease-free survival,

73
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,696
but there's a 95% chance that you wouldn't
have benefited at all.

74
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:22,754
In fact, you, even without the
Oxaliplatin,

75
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:28,260
there's a 75% chance you would remain
disease-free.

76
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,848
And, even if you took the Oxaliplatin,

77
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:34,220
there's a 20% chance that the disease
would come back anyway.

78
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,920
So that's another way of looking at it.

79
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,880
Now, moving on, let's look at a second
curve.

80
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,070
This is a randomized clinical trial
comparing Crizotinib

81
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,770
against standard chemotherapy in patients
with metastatic lung cancer.

82
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,466
And what he, there's, looking at here is
progression-free survival.

83
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:58,700
And they're measuring it over a period of
months,

84
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,700
because the metastatic lung cancer has a
pretty dismal prognosis.

85
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,540
And what you can see from this clinical
trial immediately is that

86
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,108
it's a much smaller clinical trial for our
fewer patients are at risk.

87
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:13,200
But the P-value is quite good, 0.001.

88
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,000
And not only that, the hazard ratio is
0.49, again, a very good number.

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,340
What you can see is that at the end,

90
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,770
because this is a very small clinical
trial, the curves are coming together.

91
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,840
But, we should ignore that part of the
curve,

92
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,830
because actually, the number of patients
at risk, is very small.

93
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,426
Now, what is Progression-free Survival?

94
00:07:46,426 --> 00:07:55,050
Progression-free Survival is, will
measure, the survival of the patient.

95
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,333
The patient's still alive without
progression of disease.

96
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:06,031
So, censor, censoring here would

97
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:12,640
occur for the various reasons that we
discussed in part one.

98
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,110
Lost a followup, moved away.

99
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,426
Late entry into the study, or left the
study due to toxicity.

100
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:29,200
Now, the events are progression of tumor.

101
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,426
So that, each event causes the curve to
drop,

102
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:37,460
progression of tumor, okay, as
progression-free survival.

103
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,680
But also death.

104
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,440
And, and death from any cause, death from
cancer.

105
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,317
Death from toxicity of chemotherapy or
even death in a car crash.

106
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:47,992
Now.

107
00:08:47,992 --> 00:08:54,100
[COUGH] This is progression-free survival,
okay?

108
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,368
So there's another thing that we talked
about in part one.

109
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:01,834
Overall survival.

110
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:05,540
[BLANK_AUDIO]

111
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,540
And overall survival simply uses as events
death, it doesn't care about

112
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,110
progression of tumor, it just measures
death, with other reasons.

113
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,820
Obviously a whole list of reasons for
censoring, which we had gone over.

114
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,270
Now, there's yet another way of measuring
things, and

115
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,880
that's called time to progression.

116
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:32,620
Time to progression is almost the same as
progression-free survival, but not quite.

117
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,190
And the reason it's not quite, quite the
same as in time to progression.

118
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,180
One of the reasons for censoring in
addition to all the other

119
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,650
reasons, is that deaths are censored.

120
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,010
So death from toxicity are censored.

121
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,300
Now, if the patient progresses and dies as
a result of progression, that would count.

122
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,180
But all other deaths are censored.

123
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,920
So from the FDA's point of view.

124
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,975
The FDA considers overall survival to be
the best.

125
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:09,388
Progression-free survival to be next best.

126
00:10:09,388 --> 00:10:11,890
Of course, regression-free survival
matures more,

127
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,240
quickly because there are more events.

128
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:22,290
And then, time to progression as less
desired than progression-free survival.

129
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,630
So, there you have it, a quick primer on
how to read Kaplan-Meier curves.

130
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,550
Thank you very much.
