1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,020
Microbiology is the study of microscopic
organisms.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,300
Some of which, can cause the most serious
diseases encountered by humans.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,100
When a microbe causes disease,

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,430
Physicians around the world are called on
to intervene.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,240
In many developing parts of the world,
access to resources like clean water and

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,860
basic sanitation is limited.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,430
And in those same areas, higher rates of
malnutrition, especially among

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,910
children often lead to immune suppression,
meaning that the microbes, in for

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:39,420
example, contaminated water can more
easily infect their human hosts.

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,100
Today we're going to be talking about a
bacterium that measures only about

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,870
two microns in length but if it's brought
into an area where it can easily spread.

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,820
This microbe can sweep through a community
causing potential

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,390
deadly infectious disease.

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:01,160
The most powerful protection we have
against infectious diseases like this one

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,840
is our knowledge of how microbes cause
disease both at

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,410
the level of the community and at the
level of the microbe.

17
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,600
In order to effectively prevent and treat
infectious diseases.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,010
We need to understand the environments in
which they're more likely to spread and

19
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,970
how the actions of microbes result in the
clinical disease.

20
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,620
This knowledge can lead to interventions.

21
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,110
That protect the health of the individual
and

22
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,855
the society in which they live as we see
in this case.

23
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:34,190
Felipe is an eight year old boy living in
Chapoteau,

24
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,820
a village located on an isolated spit of
land in Haiti.

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,720
Since the earthquake that shook the region
in 2010.

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,960
Clean drinking water and sanitation remain
scarce in Haiti.

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,290
There are no sewers here and even latrines
are rare.

28
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,330
Because of this, Felipe and his brother
have already seen firsthand the health

29
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,990
consequences of living without access to
basic resources.

30
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,800
Their father passed away from dehydration
due to diarrheal disease three

31
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,905
years ago and determined to protect the
health of his family in the future,

32
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:15,100
Felipe's older brother Yan had left home a
year ago

33
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,570
to study medicine at the University of
Haiti in Port-au-Prince.

34
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,940
He was the first boy in his village to
attend medical school.

35
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,820
On a visit home last April just after the
spring rains had begun in

36
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,760
Haiti the two brothers were playing
soccer.

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,270
When Felipe took a drink from a nearby
communal tap, that night Felipe

38
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,790
started having stomach cramps and began
having terrible watery diarrhea.

39
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,920
Yan was alarmed when he helped his brother
to the makeshift latrine that

40
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,050
hung over the water near their home.

41
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,020
At about two in the morning and he saw his
brother passing what seemed like litres of

42
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,235
stool and the stool reminded him of cloudy
white rice water.

43
00:02:57,235 --> 00:03:02,740
Yan immediately suspected that his younger
brother was suffering from cholera after

44
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,940
contracting vibrio colerae, the tiny
bacterium that infects the small

45
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:14,180
intestine causing a sudden onset of
violent gastrointestinal symptoms.

46
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,530
He remembered hearing from his mother that
several homes in the area had

47
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,596
recently reported family members suffering
from a terrible form of diarrhea.

48
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:27,310
Yan thought back to his first year of
medical school and

49
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,770
remembered learning about the father of
Epidemiology a physician by the name of

50
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:36,890
John Snow who had noticed the similar
clustering of cholera in a London

51
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,530
neighborhood and had linked the disease
back to a contaminated water supply.

52
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,610
Remembering his young brother's choice of
water supply that morning.

53
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,970
Yan began mentally mapping the families
who had been reported ill.

54
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,070
They all collected water from that
communal source.

55
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,250
Yan knew that his next steps would be
critical to his brother's survival.

56
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,420
Several cholera treatment centers had been
opened in

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,570
Haiti since the disease was first
introduced into the area,

58
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:11,580
likely by UN peacekeepers, who came to
Haiti from Nepal.

59
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,765
But the nearest cholera treatment center
would've required a two hour trip

60
00:04:15,765 --> 00:04:21,630
including a river crossing and Yan knew
that infection with vibrio cholerae could

61
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,790
cause rapid dehydration and death in a
matter of twelve hours if left untreated.

62
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,240
In order to result in disease a relatively
large number of

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,040
the comma shaped vibrio cholerae bacteria
need to be

64
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,480
ingested because most of them are killed
in the acidic environment of the stomach.

65
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,240
Vibrio cholerae,

66
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,370
they have recently been shed by another
human are hyper infectious,

67
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,350
meaning that they're better able to
survive passage through the stomach.

68
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,670
Once inside the small intestine,

69
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:59,890
the bacterium uses its flagellum as a
propeller and guided by Chemotaxis.

70
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,100
It swings toward the surface of the
intestine and

71
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,080
avoids being cleared by peristalsis.

72
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,605
When the bacteria reach the surface, they
need to overcome another protective

73
00:05:10,605 --> 00:05:16,180
mechanism, the thick mucous net that's
made by goblet cells to keep bacteria

74
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:22,030
away from the surface of the epithelial
cells lining the intestinal tract.

75
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,720
Labile cholerae makes enzymes use some
measures that digest the mucus and

76
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,890
allow the bacteria to penetrate the mucus.

77
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,320
Next the bacteria need to attach to the
epithelial cells and

78
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,770
this is mediated by thread like appendages
that grow out of the bacterial surface,

79
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,140
called pili or fimbriae.

80
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,240
Once the bacterium attaches itself to the
cell.

81
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,370
It begins producing a toxin that's
engulfed by the epithelial cells.

82
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:55,180
Inside the cells the cholera toxin
disrupts the functioning of chloride

83
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:01,100
channels in the cell, allowing large
amounts of chloride ion to leave the cell,

84
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,380
followed by large amounts of sodium ion.

85
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,870
Water in the lumin of the small intestine
is no longer able to be absorbed and

86
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,150
patients shed liter volumes of stool.

87
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,450
With the stool, the colon loses
bicarbonate base and

88
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,460
infected patients become dehydrated and
acidotic.

89
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,210
The copious amounts of diarrhea seen in

90
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,490
cholera patients is actually beneficial to
the organism that causes the disease.

91
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:35,110
Vibrio cholerae replicates rapidly inside
the small intestine and the watery stools

92
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,660
allow the newly minted bacteria to exit
the host and be transmitted to another.

93
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,880
Usually via fecal oral contamination.

94
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,740
This is why in parts of the world where
running water and

95
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,460
sanitation aren't available, cholera can
spread quickly and easily.

96
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,450
Back at home, Yan sees Felipe
deteriorating rapidly.

97
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,900
His eyes are sunken.

98
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,650
His skin turber is low and he's too weak
to walk.

99
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:06,040
The young medical student fashions a
Cholera cot out of a rusted deck chair and

100
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,620
asks his mother to begin sterilizing water
by boiling it over the kerosene stove.

101
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,900
When the water has cooled, Yan mixes six
teaspoons of sugar and

102
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,920
half a teaspoon of salt into one liter of
sterile water,

103
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,300
trying to stay calm as he remembers the
correct proportions of salt, sugar and

104
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:31,400
water for a homemade version of oral
rehydration solution or ORS.

105
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,660
ORS is considered first line therapy for
cholera and it's sometimes all

106
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,920
that's necessary to send an infected
patient on the road to recovery.

107
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,690
The sodium and glucose in ORS make use of

108
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,900
a different transporter to replenish
electrolytes in the host.

109
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,890
This allows for rehydration and recovery
to occur.

110
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,900
In Felipe's case, the ORS saved his life
and

111
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,070
allowed his family to transform him to a
satellite clinic operated by

112
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,310
a nonprofit organization about an hour
from their home.

113
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,720
At the clinic, Felipe received rehydration
therapy.

114
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,880
And the family was given chlorine bleach
and

115
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,034
advised to sanitize the home and safely
dispose of all fecal waste.

116
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:19,440
Yan contacted local government officials
and warnings were posted around

117
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,740
the contaminated water source with
directions on how to decontaminate

118
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,150
the water used by Yan and Felipe's
neighbors oral rehydration therapy

119
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:36,340
can reduce the risk of dying from Cholera
from 20% to 1% in many parts of the world.

120
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,060
By understanding the interactions between
socioeconomics and

121
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:45,540
the pathogenesis of infectious disease,
medical teams can develop strategies for

122
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,360
treating and preventing infectious disease
around the world.

123
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,390
And health outcomes, like Felipe's
complete recovery,

124
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,170
can become the norm in said of the
exception.
