1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,950
In this next module, I'm going to talk
about effect modification,

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,600
which is equivalent to the term
interaction.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,490
You'll see that epidemiologists tend to
use the term effect modification.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,860
It's a little easier to talk about one
variable modifying the effect of another,

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,060
it's a little easier to talk about
verbally.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,750
But statisticians prefer the term
interaction,

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,060
because that's more of a statistical term.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,190
But they're equivalent terms.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,720
So what is an effect modifier?

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,310
This is the situation where we have a
predictor and outcome that actually have

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:38,760
different relationships depending on what
level we're at of the effect modifier.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,090
Again, effect modification is also called
interaction.

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,410
So the predictor now, come now may differ
in their relationships depending on

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,610
where we are depending on the effect
modifier.

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,360
Just to say it a little bit more
Statistical terms, what we're looking for

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,130
is when the effect size, again, the
relationship between the predictor and

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,550
the outcome, is modified, is different, in
different subgroups.

18
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,920
And statistically, that would mean we
would see a statistically

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,130
significant difference of the effect
between those different subgroups.

20
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,220
So for example, if you had a blood
pressure treatment that worked

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,470
significantly better in men than in women,

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,000
we would say that the treatment had an
interaction with gender.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,810
So gender modifies the effect.

24
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,280
Of the treatment on blood pressure.

25
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,090
In this module, I'm just going to
illustrate an interaction with some

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,760
examples, we're not going to get into the,

27
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,860
details of how you statistically identify
interacting variables yet.

28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,320
Here's some data from, one of the national
health surveys.

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,100
So this was a study that was looking at
the relationship between being

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,190
overweight or obese And mortality.

31
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:42,400
The outcome variable here is years of life
loss so bigger bars higher bars

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,690
are bad that is increasing your mortality
because you have more years of life lost.

33
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,910
The different colored bars here represent
the age at

34
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,780
which you became overweight or obese.

35
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,190
So the thought being that being overweight
or obese in your twenties that might be

36
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,550
worse than if you became overweight or
obese in your thirties forties.

37
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,430
fifties, sixties, seventies.

38
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,970
It turns out that the relationship between
obesity and

39
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:09,000
years of life lost is modified by both
race and gender, and

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,460
that's what's illustrated in these next
couple of slides.

41
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,300
So if you look at white men, and you look
at the relationship, if you're This is 25.

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,280
A BMI of 25 would represent overweight.

43
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,800
A BMI of 30 or above would represent
obese.

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,244
So basically if you were obese, starting
from an early age.

45
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:27,820
You know from your twenties or your
thirties or even forties or fifties.

46
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,450
If your obese.

47
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,680
And you're a white man, you are losing
years off your life and, you know,

48
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,000
the worse the obesity the higher this
goes, where you're really morbidly obese,

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,320
you're losing a huge number of years off
of life.

50
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,030
If you then turn to look at white women,

51
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,970
however, you'll notice that the
relationship's a little bit different.

52
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:50,010
So, indeed Women, white women are losing
years off the off of life,

53
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,170
related to being overweight or obese.

54
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,280
But the curve here is not quite as steep,
it's not quite as bad if you're

55
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,470
a white woman to be morbidly obese in
terms of mortality.

56
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,010
And the relationship looks just a little
bit different.

57
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,360
And being, starting the overweight in your
twenties versus your forties in

58
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,330
women doesn't seem to make as much of a
difference as it does, did in white men.

59
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:15,310
If you look at black men which, what's
interesting is that In fact,.

60
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,290
If you're in your seventies, and

61
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,540
you become overweight or obese, the bars
are below the zero line.

62
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,540
That means you're actually increasing your
life expectancy.

63
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,440
But if you're overweight or obese up in
the, you know, higher ranges.

64
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,620
The years of life lost for a black man who
had been overweight or

65
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,210
obese since their twenties is huge.

66
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,210
It's up here, like 20 years of life lost.

67
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,830
So a much steeper increase here.

68
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,906
And a little bit of different relationship
with depending on when you get.

69
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,400
Obesity or overweight occur.

70
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,480
Then if you look at black women, the
pattern again is very different, and

71
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,830
there's not much increase in years of life
lost until you get to the really,

72
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,620
really high levels of obesity.

73
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,660
So very different relationships Depending
on both gender and race, so

74
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,000
we would say that both gender and race
modify the effect of obesity on mortality.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,400
And equivalently you could also say that
the interaction between race and

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,260
BMI is significant and also the
interaction between gender and

77
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,960
BMI is significant, so the impact of BMI.

78
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,930
On mortality differs by race and gender.

79
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,690
Just a couple more examples just to
illustrate and

80
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,320
make sure you're on the same page here.

81
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,370
So here's another example where we were,
we're looking at,

82
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,870
what we're looking at in these graphics is
whether or

83
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,820
not that your education level, this is
quintiles of education.

84
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,720
Whether or not that affects when you get
diagnosed with breast cancer, whether or

85
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,160
not you're diagnosed when the tumor is
local, regional, or

86
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,960
in the black bars here are distant.

87
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,250
So obviously,

88
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,840
with any cancer you want to be diagnosed
when the cancer is still local.

89
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,380
It hasn't spread.

90
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,880
So if we look at white women And we look
across Quintiles of Education.

91
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,840
You can see that as you go up in the
quintiles,

92
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,610
you tend to have more cancers diagnosed
locally,

93
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,750
you tend to have fewer cancers diagnosed
at a distant, a metasticed stage.

94
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,140
So interestingly however, If you look at
black women,

95
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,960
that relationship doesn't seem to be the
true so as you go across quintiles of

96
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,490
education there's not much of a change in
local diagnosis versus distant diagnosis.

97
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,210
I don't know why that would be but for

98
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,450
some reason the relationship between
education and

99
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:25,310
stage of cancer diagnosis is different
between white and, and black women.

100
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,065
So we would say that there's an
interaction here between race It's

101
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:28,940
and education.

102
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,710
And a final example, the typical things

103
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,140
that you're going to see that tend to be
effect modifiers or interacting variables.

104
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,200
Age might be one of them, race.

105
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,503
Gender these are sort of the big ones for
women pre-menopausal verses

106
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:50,890
post-menopausal often makes a difference
so this is an example we're looking at

107
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,260
colon cancer the relationship between
obesity and colon cancer

108
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,180
is different in pre-menopausal women then
in post-menopausal women so I'll just.

109
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,740
going to zero in on some things on the
chart.

110
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,430
So if you look among pre-menopausal women.

111
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,070
Then obesity increases.

112
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,320
About doubles your risk of colon or colon
rectal cancers.

113
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,280
That's for pre-menopausal women.

114
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,920
However if you look in post menopausal
women it's the opposite.

115
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,980
the, for post-menopausal women being obese
is actually slightly protective.

116
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,640
It doesn't quite reach statistical
significance.

117
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,670
But it's a slightly.

118
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,250
Protected or at least unrelated to colon
cancer in post-menopausal women.

119
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,910
Interestingly if you look at breast cancer
it's the opposite.

120
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,030
So for breast cancer obesity is a risk
factor for

121
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,490
breast cancer in postmenopausal women, but
not in pre-menopausal women.

122
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,320
So these are the types of things that are
typical interacting or

123
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,860
effect modifying variables.
