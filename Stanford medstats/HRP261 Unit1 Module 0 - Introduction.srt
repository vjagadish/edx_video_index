1
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,470
Welcome to HRP 261.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,360
This course covers more advanced
statistical tests for

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,670
analyzing discrete data.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,170
So the data sets that we're going to deal
with in

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,530
this course have outcome variables that
are categorical.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,230
That could be binary, ordinal or nominal
categories.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,560
We're going to cover a number of tests in
this course.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,340
Both those that we use when we have
independent observations as well as

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,420
tests that are used when you have
clustering in your data sets,

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,660
some kind of correlations among your
observations.

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,580
We'll also talk about the situation where
you have sparse data.

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,200
The concern when you have sparse data is
that most of our statistical tests work

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,750
by, we take a discrete distribution and

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,270
we approximate that with a continuous
distribution.

15
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,140
For example, we might take a binomial and
approximate it as a normal.

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,140
That is fine if you have large numbers,
but

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,380
it can fall down if you have small sample
sizes, especially if you

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,130
have certain cells in your data set that
are very, have very few observations.

19
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,180
In that case you want to use exact test.

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,240
All those exact tests are, is we just go
back to the discrete distribution, and

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,370
we avoid approximating.

22
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,540
So let me just give a quick overview of
the tests when we're going to

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,830
cover them in the course.

24
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,960
In fact, this week, the first week of the
course,

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,020
we're going to run through a whole bunch
of these statistical tests.

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,940
I'm assuming that because you've had a
prior course in statistics you

27
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,380
will have encountered most of these
before.

28
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,540
So we're going to quickly run through all
the tests that are used for

29
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,050
the situation where you are not trying to
adjust for anything.

30
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,050
Where you're just trying to compare two
variables in a,

31
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,880
some kind of contingency table.

32
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,340
So these would be the risk difference or

33
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,740
relative risks, chi-squared test,
McNemar's test or the Fisher's exact test.

34
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,960
Again, I'm assuming most of these will be
familiar to you, so I'm

35
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,610
going to go through this rather quickly,
assuming that it's largely review.

36
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,720
If you were in HRP259 in the fall, you
should have seen all of

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,440
these tests already, and this week should
be fairly easy.

38
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,840
It should be mostly review,

39
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,380
maybe a few additional points I, I'm
adding to those tests.

40
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,750
But we'll run through that rather quickly.

41
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,930
Then next week we're going to talk about
the Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Square test.

42
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:13,050
This is the situation where we want to
stratify our contingency tables.

43
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,140
We're essentially adding a third variable
into the picture.

44
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,870
We'll also talk in detail about
confounding and interaction.

45
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,100
It will be important to understand these
well before we move on to

46
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,010
regression modelling.

47
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,990
The rest of the course, the remaining
eight weeks of the course,

48
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,320
we're going to be talking about
regression.

49
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,550
So we're going to be covering all of the
rest of these tests,

50
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,830
which are all regression methods.

51
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,520
Mostly versions of logistic regression.

52
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,010
We'll talk about ordinal, multinomial,
conditional, and

53
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,690
exact logistic regression.

54
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,340
We'll also talk about GEE modeling.

55
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,900
A lot of what we're going to discuss in
this course has to do with,

56
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,460
how do you build a regression model?

57
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,480
And those principles,

58
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,140
although we're going to be applying them
to logistic regression in this course,

59
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,140
are in fact applicable to other types of
regression such as linear regression.

60
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,310
If you did not take HRP259 in the fall and
you're not coming out of a medical or

61
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,780
epidemiology background, and you don't
really, aren't really familiar with

62
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,800
the various study designs that we use in
epidemiology and medical research, I would

63
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,530
recommend that you take the optional,
watch the optional module on study design.

64
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,040
So with terms like cross-sectional study,
cohort study, randomized trial, case

65
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,210
control study, if those aren't familiar to
you, you need to watch that module.

66
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,100
This is not a course in Study Design, but
the way that we analyze our data is

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,550
always going to be influenced by the study
design from which the data came, and so

68
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,970
I will be throwing around those terms and

69
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,980
assuming that you're familiar with all
those study designs.

70
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,540
So please watch that if, if you're not
familiar with those things.

71
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,670
What we're going to cover this week in
Unit One is all of the following tests.

72
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,380
Again, these are just your basic tests for
analyzing data in contingency tables.

73
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,650
So this includes risk ratios, odds ratios,
risk difference, and McNemar's test for

74
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,750
correlated data.

75
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,550
Those apply in the situation where you
have two binary variables and

76
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,880
you just want to see if those binary
variables are associated.

77
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,550
So, a 2 by 2 table.

78
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,640
If we want to do a larger contingency
table,

79
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,200
like a 3 by 3 table, you have to use a
chi-squared or a Fisher's Exact test.

80
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,090
And, of course, the chi-squared and

81
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,380
Fisher's Exact tests can also be applied
to the 2 by 2 table.

82
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,750
So I'm going to run through all of these
tests this week, and

83
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,360
again hopefully this is mostly review for
you.
