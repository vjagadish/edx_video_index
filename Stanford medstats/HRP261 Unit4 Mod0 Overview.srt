00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,320
Welcome to week four of HRP 261.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,690
This week we're going to continue our
discussion of Logistic Regression.

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,870
So, last week I told you how to interpret
and estimate the alphas and

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,360
the betas from a logistic regression
model.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,270
This week we're going to talk more about
the model over all.

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,760
What are some of the ways that you check
the model in terms of assumptions and

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,220
model fit?

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,474
I'm also going to tell you how to test for
confounding and

9
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:32,659
interaction within the framework of
regression, and those principles will

10
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,960
apply across many types of regression, not
just logistic regression.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,510
So I'll throw in a couple of linear
regression analyses to illustrate that.

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,970
Now the teaser for this week.

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,990
This is a study we're going to get back to
in the last module for this week.

14
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,520
This was a study that was looking at what
are predictors of which women will get

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,810
their annual breast cancer screening as
they're supposed to.

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,810
So get the annual mammography.

17
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,360
This is a binary outcome because either
women were doing a good job on their

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,190
screening or they weren't.

19
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,930
And the authors thought that perhaps, if
you had a family history of breast cancer,

20
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,840
you might be more likely to go for your
annual screening.

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,110
They also thought that how much you
worried about breast

22
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,970
cancer might also impact the chances that
you would go for your annual screening.

23
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,070
But what's interesting here is that the
authors have thrown in a couple of

24
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,600
interaction terms, and we're going to be
talking about interactions this week.

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,220
So if you go down to the bottom here,

26
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,040
you'll notice there are two interaction
terms.

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,650
There is worry interacting with itself.

28
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,280
Another way to say that is that we have a
worry squared term.

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,520
We also have worry interacting with family
history.

30
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,080
In other words, the effect of worry on
your likelihood of getting annual

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,578
mammography might depend on whether you
are a high risk or low risk woman.

32
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,570
And we're going to worry less about the
significance here,

33
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,780
we're not going to pay so much attention
to, to statistical significance.

34
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,250
We're going to talk more about the affect
sizes.

35
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,310
When you have interacting terms in your
model, how do you present the odds ratios?

36
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,250
And in fact the way that the authors have
presented the odds ratios here

37
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,530
isn't quite right, because how, what does
it mean that your

38
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,710
worry squared has an odds ratio of 0.97,
or what does it mean that your

39
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,320
worry times family history interacting
term has an odds ratio of 0.98?

40
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,120
Well in fact really, there isn't a single
odds ratio for these terms.

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,330
The fact that there's interaction in the
model,

42
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,430
what that means is, is that there are
multiple effect sizes.

43
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,920
In other words, there are multiple odds
ratios.

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,470
There's more than one.

45
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,780
So there's more than one odds ratio for
family history.

46
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,870
Your, your odds ratio for family history
changes depending on your level of worry,

47
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,250
and similarly, your odds ratio for worry

48
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:55,750
changes depending on both your family
history and your level of worry.

49
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,640
So at different levels of worry,

50
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,250
an increase in worry will have a different
effect.

51
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,300
That's what we mean by a squared term.

52
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,860
We'll get back to this example.

53
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,640
And in the last module of this week, we're
going to have some

54
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,920
fun talking about how to calculate odds
ratios in the presence of interaction, and

55
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,480
how to report those correctly.
