1
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,500
In this next module I'm going to talk
about a very

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,590
important continuous distribution function
called the normal function, and

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,810
of course we've seen it already quite a
bit in this course.

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,110
So the normal distribution we saw already
has a bell shape.

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,898
It has 2 parameters that define it just
like the.

6
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:28,650
Binomial had 2 parameter that define it N
and P.

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,070
The normal has 2 parameter's mu and the
mean and sigma the standard deviation.

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,160
The nice thing about the normal is the
mean and

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,860
the sigma, the standard deviation are
already calculated for you.

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,450
They define the curve so you don't have to
calculate those by hand.

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,490
So, if you shift the mean, you shift the
distribution left or right.

12
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:53,360
If you, if you increase the, the sigma,
you widen the curve.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,680
If you decrease the sigma, the curve
becomes more narrow.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,540
And that is a whole family of curves, of
bell curves defined by mu and sigma.

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,710
Now, just for fun Don't get thrown by this
if you are a little, intimidated by math.

16
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,700
But just for fun I'm showing you here the
actual mathematical function that

17
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,110
defines the bell curve.

18
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,010
So all of this fancy math, all that it
say's is that if you were to

19
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,460
plug this into a graphing calculator, or a
graphing, program in a computer.

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,310
It would spit back out for you, a bell
curve.

21
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,670
And there's a whole bunch of constants,
the way, the reason it looks so bad is

22
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,010
here is we've got a bunch of constants in
here that make it look more complicated.

23
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,920
Like E is just the exponential function
that's just 2.71 blah, blah, blah.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,190
And pi, you all know, is 3.14, etcetera.

25
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,870
And then there's 2 parameters, again,

26
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,020
that define exactly what the bell curve
looks like.

27
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,210
Those are your sigma and your mu.

28
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,690
So different, if you change sigma and mu,
you change the shape of the bell curve.

29
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,666
But they all belong to one single.

30
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,770
Mathematical family of functions.

31
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,220
And that again, is just a function there
just for

32
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,290
fun, and that's the probability density
function for a bell curve.

33
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,050
It's a probability function so we know
that the area under the curve of

34
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,390
any bell curve that follows this function,
must sum to one.

35
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,530
It must integrate to one.

36
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,890
And so, again this is purely for fun.

37
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,730
I'm never going to ask you to work out
this integral.

38
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,130
But if you were to integrate this
mathematical function,

39
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,160
from negative infinity to positive
infinity, it indeed integrates to one.

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,880
So that means, that that's the proof that
indeed the area under this curve is one,

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,110
so it is, that makes it a probability
function.

42
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,530
And the expected value of this function is
just mule.

43
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,310
But it turns out that you could, you could
show that,

44
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,760
you could apply the expected value formula
here.

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,540
Again if this bothers you, if all these
integrals bother you,

46
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,600
you can scroll ahead of this.

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,030
It's not absolutely necessary, but just
you understand, the.

48
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,750
If you were to multiply X times that
probability function, and

49
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,590
integrate, which is like summing up, that
would actually give you back mu.

50
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,170
You may not want to solve that integral by
hand, but if you do it gives you back mu.

51
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,862
And same thing if you apply the variance
formula here and solve that.

52
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:09,620
Yeah amazing integral here it would just
give you back sigma squared so

53
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,610
again we don't actually have to solve for
expected value of

54
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,430
our varience here because it turns out
that the the mean is new and

55
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,800
the varience is sigma squared those define
the curve.

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,830
So those, I just showing these for fun.

57
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,740
Now remember that, we have, when we, are
on a perfect normal curve,

58
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,298
perfect mathematical funtion, we have this
rule that we know that 68% of

59
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:33,057
observations will fall within one standard
deviation of the mean, 95 within two.

60
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:35,290
And 99.7% within 3.

61
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,090
We've seen this rule and used it with real
data before.

62
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,250
Well, where did that rule come from?

63
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,120
I just told you that rule, but why should
you believe me?

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,270
Well, what that rule came from is that, in
fact, if you integrate any normal

65
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:54,050
distribution bell curve, that follows that
particular mathematical function.

66
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,420
That it always turns out that 68% of the
area under the curve will fall

67
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,045
between one standard deviation below, up
to one standard deviation above the mean.

68
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:06,150
95% of the area will fall between two
standard deviations below to two

69
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,410
standard deviations above the mean.

70
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,840
So we, again saw this rule Earlier but now
I'm just telling you where it comes from.

71
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,990
It just comes from calculus, from the
math.

72
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,080
The area under the curve is always 68%
between one

73
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,230
standard deviation below to one standard
deviation above the mean and

74
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,500
you could actually, if you wanted, of
course.

75
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,970
You're not going to have to do this in
this course but if you wanted to,

76
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,380
you could do that integral and

77
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,550
you could show that if you're going from
mu minus sigma to mu plus sigma.

78
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,030
And you integrate here that that will give
you 68% etc.

79
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,230
Of course, you know, again your not
going to have to do those integrals, but

80
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,570
just understand that's why that's where
that 689599.7 percent rule comes from.

81
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,420
It just comes from the mathematical curve
from the areas under the curve.

82
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,320
Alright, so that's a really useful rule.

83
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,814
68, 95, 99.7, is useful for a lot
problems.

84
00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:03,070
So suppose SAT scores, math SAT scores,
say follow a roughly normal distribution.

85
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,620
A lot of IQ tests and,

86
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,530
and standardized tests like this will end
up following a normal distribution.

87
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,250
And lets say that, the mean, math SAT
score is 500 and

88
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,470
the standard deviation is 50.

89
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,260
I'm just making those up,

90
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,100
but that's probably reasonably close to
what it actually is.

91
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,300
We know a whole bunch of things.

92
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,120
If we know it's on a normal curve, then
because of this 95, 90.

93
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,160
68-95-99.7 rule.

94
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,835
We know that 68% of students will have
scores 450 and 550,

95
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:32,445
that's one standard deviation below to one
standard deviation above the mean.

96
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:35,943
We also know that 95% of students will be
between 400 and

97
00:05:35,943 --> 00:05:39,395
600, two standard deviations below to two
standard deviations above the mean.

98
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:44,050
And we know that 99.7% will be between 350
and 650.

99
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,220
Now that's all very useful but it's
limited, right?

100
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,520
We would like to be able to do more with
the normal curve.

101
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,360
So that answers some questions, but it
answers only particular questions.

102
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,840
What if I instead ask something like,

103
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,794
what's the probability of getting a math
SAT score of 575 or less?

104
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:05,550
Well 575 wasn't on one of those boundaries
that I just showed you,

105
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,465
it doesn't fall at either 1 standard
deviation or 2 standard deviations or

106
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:11,020
3 standard deviations away from the mean.

107
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,550
So our 68-95-99.7 rule doesn't help us
here.

108
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,600
So you might think oh, no we're going to
have to go to calculus and

109
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,050
do an integral to figure this out, right.

110
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,320
I mean you would get the answer if you, if
you know the math and

111
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,470
I'm like, here's my normal curve.

112
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,180
Here's my mean of 500.

113
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,050
It's got a standard deviation of 50, and

114
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:35,640
I literally could integrate from negative
infinity all the way up to 575.

115
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,040
I could do this integral under the curve,
right?

116
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,210
Now, again, I'm not going to, you're not
going to have to do this, I promise.

117
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,250
But that would be mathematically the w-,
one way.

118
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,140
To, to solve that, you could actually do
that integral and find out that,

119
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,970
that area under the curve, and that would
be the probability of getting 575 or less.

120
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,720
But here's the integral again, just for
fun.

121
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,970
Solve this integral?

122
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,250
No thanks.

123
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,110
It looks like a pain to solve, and we
don't want to,

124
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,610
should be a negative infinity, that we
don't really want to have to solve this.

125
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,050
All right.
So we need a, we need something else.

126
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,260
We need something else to do when it's not
right on, 68, 95, 99.7.

127
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,390
So, this is where we're going to bring in
a little trick.

128
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,810
We're going to bring in something called
the standard normal curve, or z scores.

129
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,810
And this is basically, we're going to take
all normal curves, and

130
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,900
we're going to make them fall on a single
normal curve.

131
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,460
And that's going to be the normal curve
where we have a mean of zero,

132
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,620
and a standard deviation of one.

133
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,010
You can see that it's in, it's
advantageous if the mean is zero, and

134
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,890
the standard deviation of 1 is 1, because
that simplifies all of the math.

135
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,330
So we're going to force every single
normal curve that we encounter to fall.

136
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,180
We're going to force it,

137
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,840
to instead, be on this universal currency
of the standard normal curve.

138
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,410
We're going to turn everything into what
we call z scores.

139
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,216
Z scores are just Standard deviation
units.

140
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:59,950
So all that we're doing here is instead of
talking about units of SAT score for

141
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,250
example, which are going to vary.

142
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,060
Your units of height or whatever units we
happen to be talking about.

143
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,670
We're going to translate everything
instead into standard deviation units.

144
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,160
We're going to convert all normal
distributions onto the standard

145
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,730
normal chart.

146
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,410
Essentially we're going to be talking
about units in standard deviation.

147
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,130
So, remember that 575 on the SAT score.

148
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:28,690
We just want to ask the question, well if
somebody gets a 575,

149
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,745
how many standard deviatoins are they
above the mean?

150
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:35,040
Well I can answer question I could just
reason it out.

151
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,550
I don't even need this formula over here.

152
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:42,900
If they're 575 and the standard is 50 and

153
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,020
mean is 500 75 is 1.5 standard deviation
above the mean.

154
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,230
That's all we're doing when we're
calculating the Z score.

155
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,360
So how did I get that?

156
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,680
I subtract the mean and I divided by the
standard deviation.

157
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,360
So, that person is, if they're 575 they're
1.5 standard deviations above the mean.

158
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,770
So we put everything, no matter what the
original curve we started with was,

159
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,236
we put everything into this common
standard deviation units.

160
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:12,720
And the reason is that this is really
nice, is that somebody went through and

161
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,670
did all of the integrals for the standard
normal curve and put them in a chart.

162
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,430
And of course, now you can get all of this
on a computer.

163
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,470
But and so all you have to do is, if you
can get back to the standard normal,

164
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,330
then you can figure out the probabilities
that are associated with

165
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,280
all possible different, different z
scores.

166
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,700
Again, well all we're doing here, is we're
taking the original curve,

167
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,340
where the mean was 500, the standard
deviation was 50.

168
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,560
And we were talking about figuring out if
we are 575,

169
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,230
what's the area to the left of 575.

170
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,890
Instead of figuring that out, which is
trickier,

171
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,160
we're going to convert into these Z
scores, standard deviation unit scores,

172
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,760
and say well, 575 is 1.5 standard
deviations above the mean.

173
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,400
Then we can go to a standard normal chart,
where somebody has already done

174
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,020
the integral to tell us what is the area
on a standard normal to the left of 1.5.

175
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,400
Somebody has already done that interval
for us, and

176
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,200
we can find it by going to a standard
normal chart.

177
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,499
So I'm going to show you how to use these
charts.

178
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:10,820
So, again, somebody has literally gone
through and done all of the integrals for

179
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,510
all the z, you know, up to a certain
decimal place

180
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,160
All the z values from negative, you know,
3.5 all the way up to positive 3.

181
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,480
So if you can get everything out of
standard normal then there's a chart that

182
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,020
gives you the probabilities that, of, that
go with all the different z values.

183
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,160
So if we want to know what's the
probability of getting 575 or

184
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,150
less you can see that, that probability is
going to be pretty big.

185
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,570
You can just see that from this picture,
right.

186
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,050
This probability's greater than 50%.

187
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:40,060
It's very likely that you're going to get
575 or less.

188
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,890
So what's that probability again?

189
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,820
We translate it into a Z score by
subtracting the mean and

190
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,540
dividing by the standard deviation to turn
it into standard deviation units, and

191
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,980
then we have to go to a standard normal
chart.

192
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,680
We're going to look this up in a standard
normal chart.

193
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,853
I'll show you how to look it up in a
minute.

194
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:58,410
When you look it up in a standard normal
chart you get that the probability of

195
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,089
being to the left of 1.5 z scores is
93.32%.

196
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:08,746
So your chance of getting 575 more or less
on the mathecity is 93.3 per cent.

197
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:11,310
So here is what these charts look like and
how do we read them.

198
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,900
Now, the reality is that these charts are
getting a little old-fashioned,

199
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,540
because most things we do nowadays, we do
them on a computer.

200
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,860
And it's very rare nowadays that I
actually have to go back to my good old

201
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,230
pen and paper standard normal chart but,
you should know how to read them.

202
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,450
They're a little bit of a relic, and

203
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,380
you know, a lot of this will get done on a
computer, but

204
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,160
you should still understand the standard
normal chart.

205
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,270
So, if I want to figure out what's the
area to the left of 1.5,

206
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,260
first of all most of these charts are set
up to give you the area to the left.

207
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,010
So, if you look at this picture up here,
it's telling you it's going to be

208
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,140
giving you the area to the left of a
particular z value or 0.

209
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,050
By convention it usually gives areas to
the left.

210
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,600
So, if I want to find out the area to the
left of 1.5,

211
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,000
I have to look up the z score 1.5 in my
chart.

212
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,660
So, I'm going to first look up 1.5 in the
row.

213
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,020
I start there, and then most of these
charts are set up so

214
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,280
that you can go out an additional decimal
place.

215
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,120
So we want to know the area to the right
of 1.50, so

216
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,260
then I'm going to go down the column that
corresponds to a zero in the decimal place

217
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,510
so this gives me the 1.50.

218
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,390
It turned out that the area is 93.32% so

219
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,320
that's the area to the left of a z-score
of 1.5.

220
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,340
What is the what if we gotten a Z of 1.51
just to

221
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,700
show you how to read this chart when you
don't have a 0 there.

222
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,200
So again if it was 1.51 you start on the
row that's the 1.5 and then you go for

223
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,080
the column for that decimal the 0.01 so
that gets you to the 1.51.

224
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,690
The area for

225
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,540
that would be 93.45%, just slightly bigger
because that Z is slightly bigger.

226
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,120
It's helpful here I think to just do a
practice problem.

227
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,780
The [UNKNOWN], this is the kind of thing
that if you

228
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,445
do a few practice problems you'll get the
hang of it.

229
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:54,365
If birth weights in our population are
normally distributed with a mean of

230
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:58,649
109 ounces and a standard deviation of 13
ounces then,

231
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:00,980
what is the chance of obtaining a birth
weight?

232
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,700
So, if you're giving birth to a random
baby what's the bi,

233
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,730
chance of obtaining a birth rate of 141
ounces or heavier or

234
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,309
if you're just kind of sampling birth
records at random.

235
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:14,205
What's the chance of that random baby is
going to have a weight of

236
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:15,550
141 ounces or heavier?

237
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:20,500
And what's the chance of obtaining a birth
weight of 120 or lighter?

238
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,670
So let's solve both of those problems.

239
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,460
Again, we're assuming that these
birthrates are normally distributed,

240
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:29,070
the mean is 109, the standard deviation is
13.

241
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,220
So to solve the first one, I think it's
helpful to always draw a picture,

242
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,800
especially when you start, when you're
just starting out these.

243
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,910
So let's think about what did the curve
look like.

244
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,100
So the birth weights, the mean birth
weight is 109, and

245
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,340
the standard deviation is 13.

246
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,600
So we're on that normal curve.

247
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,470
And then I want to figure out where am I
relative to 109 if I'm

248
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,880
talking about a weight of 141.

249
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,640
Well, 141 is pretty far out in the right
tail.

250
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,120
It's much higher than the mean.

251
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,270
And I'm asking to, for the probability of
getting a weight of 141 or heavier.

252
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:07,380
So, I'm asking for the area to the right
of 141, that small area in the tail.

253
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,490
If I draw the picture then I know the
probability that I'm going to get out at

254
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,240
the end of the day better be small.

255
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,150
If it's not, I know I'm going to have done
something wrong.

256
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,250
Now I need to convert this into a z score.

257
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,346
So the z score here is I'm going to say,

258
00:14:19,346 --> 00:14:25,360
well 141 is 2.46 standard deviation above
the mean.

259
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,140
How did I get that?

260
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,960
I subtracted 141 minus 109.

261
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,710
That gives me the distance above the mean
and

262
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,600
then I divide it by 13 to get it in
standard deviation units.

263
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,090
So my z is 2.46.

264
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,310
That's pretty far in the tail of a normal
distribution.

265
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,210
I'm 2.46 standard deviations above the
mean.

266
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:45,260
What's the chance that a random baby is
2.46 standard deviations above the mean or

267
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,260
even higher than that?

268
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,800
So that's, I'm looking for the area to the
right of z equals 2.46.

269
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,690
So I can go to my standard normal chart.

270
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,332
First of all, I need to find the z for
2.46.

271
00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:58,520
So i'm going to find, the z for 2.46.

272
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,840
Again, I get that by doing the row is 2.4.

273
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,458
The column is the .06 part.

274
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:09,560
And, I get an area, the area to the left,

275
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,940
remember the charts are setup to always
give you the area to the left.

276
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,400
So this is giving me the area to the left.

277
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,130
The area to the left, there's 2.46 which
we know is way out in the tail.

278
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,660
That area, not surprisingly is very big,
99.31%.

279
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,340
So what's the chance, what's the area to
the right then?

280
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,190
How do you get the area to the right?

281
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,760
You're going to have to subtract 1 minus
.9931 will give me the area to the right.

282
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,100
Which turns out to be .69%, a pretty
small, percentage there.

283
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:42,330
Because as you don't tend to have babies
that heavy.

284
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,430
Let's answer the 2nd practice question,

285
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,850
what's the chance of obtaining a birth
weight of 120 or lighter?

286
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,700
Again, let's draw out the picture, so

287
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,656
again, we're on a normal curve where the
mean is 109.

288
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:58,430
The standard deviation is 13.

289
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,350
I want to know, what's the chance of
obtaining a birth rate of 120 or

290
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,220
lighter, so now I'm looking for the area
to the left.

291
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,660
So 120 is above the mean, so

292
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,000
I know that my answer here is going to
have to be greater than 50.

293
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,910
Mo, a lot of babies are 120 or lighter.

294
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,650
How many, what's my Z here?

295
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,580
So 120 minus 109 divided by 13.

296
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,470
I, my Z is 0.85 so I'm not quite a
standard deviation above the mean.

297
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,999
I want to know the area to the left, so I
go to the standard normal chart.

298
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,680
And, again, I look in the row for .8, and
then I get the,

299
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,200
I want the .85, so I look in the column
for the .05, that second decimal place,

300
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,010
that gives me an area of 80.23%, and that,
I wanted the area to the left.

301
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:46,469
So there's an 80.23% that a random baby
will be 120 ounces or lighter.
