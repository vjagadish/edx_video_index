1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,580
So, that's all there really is to the
multinomial logistic regression.

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,170
But now we want to tell you a little about
the map behind it and what the likelihood

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,130
function actually looks like to help you
understand it a little bit better.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,250
So, we call that,we have

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,419
learned previously about the binomial
distribution.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,370
So if we had a variable that was
distributed in a binomial distribution

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:31,010
with an N, of a sample size of N and a
probability of a positive event of

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,910
P then the probability that we would get
exactly X positive events was equal to n,

9
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,420
choose x, p the probability of a positive
event raised to

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,530
the number of positive events, and then
one minus p raised to n minus x,

11
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,129
so you've seen that probability
distribution before, the binomial.

12
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,060
The multinomial I'm going to show you in
just a second here,

13
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,870
looks an awful lot like a binomial.

14
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,790
It's just a generalization of the binomial
distribution.

15
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,970
So that we are no longer constrained to
having two potential outcomes.

16
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,430
We now can have three outcomes or four
outcomes.

17
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,930
I'm just going to show you the the formula
when we have three outcomes.

18
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,050
It gets a little bit cumbersome after you
get more than three.

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,050
But let me show you now the probability
formula for three outcomes.

20
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,660
So for on a multinomial distribution,
there are more than two possible outcomes.

21
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,450
So let me just give an example.

22
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,490
Imagine we're in a room of 100 people, and
we know there's going to be

23
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,480
some democrats, some republicans, and some
green party members there.

24
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,170
And we know what tho,

25
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,360
the probability of each of those different
types of people is going to be.

26
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,960
So in this case, my.

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,840
I have 100 trials, my n is 100, and let's
say I want to know what is

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,920
the probability that I get exactly 45
democrats in the room.

29
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,920
Exactly 40 republicans, and exactly five
green party members.

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,870
That's one potential outcome in this room
of 100 people.

31
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,630
There's a lot of possible outcomes, so

32
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,680
the probability of this exact outcome may
not be very high.

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,110
But what is that probability?

34
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,790
So, according to the multinomial formula
it's going to be n

35
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:12,830
factorial divided by x factorial, x is
going to be 45 for the democrats.

36
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,370
Divided by y factorial which will be 40
factorial divided by 5 factorial.

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,860
So that looks an awful lot like the
coefficient like a regular old binomial

38
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:27,930
which was just n factorial divided by n
minus x factorial divided by x factorial.

39
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,465
So that was the, the coefficient from a
binomial.

40
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:34,840
We've just expanded that to have more than
two possible outcomes in the denominator.

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,300
That coefficient will then be multiplied
by the probability of being a Democrat,

42
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,760
whatever that is, raised to 45 so that
that's number we actually saw.

43
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,740
Times the probability of being a
Republican raised to 40 and

44
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,060
then times the probability being a green
party member.

45
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,930
These three probabilities have to add up
to one.

46
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,490
So, the probability of being a green party
member is going to be

47
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,250
1 minus the probability of a being of a
democrat minus the probability of

48
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,640
being a republic and we are going to raise
that to five.

49
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,490
That will give us the exact the
probability of getting exactly 45

50
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,280
democrats, 40 republicans and five green
party members in that room of 100.

51
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,040
I don't expect you to calculate
multinomial probabilities by hand, but

52
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,740
I just wanted to show you that it looks an
awful lot like the binomial formula.

53
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,220
So it should be a little bit familiar to
you.

54
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,736
Well, the way that we built the
likelihood.

55
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:28,010
Function for regular logistic regression
was just based on binomial probability.

56
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,810
Similarly, we're going to be building the
likelihood function for

57
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,370
multinomial logistic regression, built
based on multinomial probabilities.

58
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,060
That's the idea.
But let me just review for

59
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,510
you, because this is good review.

60
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,200
What does the likelihood function look
like when we're

61
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,160
just talking about regular binomial
logistic regression?

62
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,230
So go back now to the two models that I
talked about.

63
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,510
So let's just for a minute talk about
we're going to be fitting two separate

64
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,440
likelihood functions when we talk about a
series of binary logistic regressions.

65
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,420
We'll be fitting a likelihood for model
one, and that's an outcome of [UNKNOWN],

66
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,380
and we'll be fitting likelihood for model
two, that was [UNKNOWN].

67
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,790
So we'll actually have two separate
likelihood functions that we'll have to

68
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,060
solve separately.

69
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,870
That will look a little bit different from
what we see in the multinomial case.

70
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,358
But for model one we have to we're, we're
trying to estimate the intercept for

71
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:27,360
the [UNKNOWN] outcome and the beta for the
[UNKNOWN] outcome.

72
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,790
And that's what we're trying to estimate.

73
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,180
We do that by fitting a likelihood.

74
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,390
What's going to go in the likelihood?

75
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,310
So the likelihood, the term that's
going to go in the likelihood for

76
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,720
all [UNKNOWN] is the exact same
probability term we've been dealing with

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,510
all along here.

78
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,280
It's going to look like the following.

79
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,944
Right, so that's the predicted

80
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:59,730
probability that a woman will have
amenorrhea.

81
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,810
So all 13 women who have a amenorrhea,
they're going to get

82
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,510
a term in the likelihood that represents
the probability of having amenorrhea,

83
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,630
cause they actually did have it.

84
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,790
Of course the terms are all going to be
slightly different for these 13 women,

85
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,220
cause we're going to plug in their
individual EDIA score.

86
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,450
Some of them may have the same value
there, but

87
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,490
some of them may have different values.

88
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,990
Those women get those terms in the
likelihood.

89
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,110
If you're unamenorrheic, you're going to
get a term in the likelihood that

90
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,870
represents the probability of not having
amenorrhea, and that's going to look like

91
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,320
the following predicted probability that
we've again seen before.

92
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,300
Same denominator, but we have a one in the
numerator.

93
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,540
So that represents the hundred women who
were eumenorrheic,

94
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,040
who did not have amenorrhea.

95
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,500
We'd be plugging in again their individual
EDIA values.

96
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,220
We're going to end up here with 113 things
multiplied together,

97
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,230
we will then solve that likelihood, or the
computer will solve that likelihood to

98
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:55,815
find out the exact values the best, most
likely values of the intercept and better.

99
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,360
We've all, we've seen this before, this
should be just review.

100
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,120
Coming over here, when we fit this model
for

101
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,360
oligomenorrhea The likelihood function is
going to look like the following.

102
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,390
We're fitting an intercept for a oligo
amenorrhea and

103
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,550
a data for a oligomenorrhea.

104
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,110
All the 37 women who are oligomenorrhea
when

105
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,860
in this data set will get a term that
looks like this in their likelihoods,

106
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,121
because they actually do have the outcome
of oligomenorrhea.

107
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:27,740
And all the women who are umetiquerial

108
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,710
get a term where there's a one in the
numerator, but the same denominator.

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,480
And of course, again, there's going to be
137 terms,

110
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,930
things multiply together in this
likelihood function.

111
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,660
Each women cancer own EDAI value plugged
in but we'll

112
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,660
use this likelihood on the computer, well,
to solve for the alpha and the beta here.

113
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,030
So, that's just review.

114
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,250
Now, lets turn to what the likelihood
function looks like for

115
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,630
the multinomial case.

116
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,730
In the multinomial case,

117
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,730
there are three types of terms that are
going to go in the likelihood.

118
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,000
The term for the amenorrheic woman is
going to look different for,

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,420
from the term from, for the
oligomenorrheaic women and

120
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,100
it's going to look different from the term
for the eumenorrheaic women.

121
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,850
And I'll be representing the interseper-,
remember,

122
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,510
trying to estimate two intercepts here,
one for amenorrhea, one for

123
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,750
oligomenorrhea, and two betas, one for
amenorrhea and one for oligomenorrhea.

124
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,560
So four things we're trying to estimate.

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,290
So what is the term for the amenorrheaic
women going to look like?

126
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,990
So first of all, let's do the denominator.

127
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,470
In the denominator, we're going to put the
following: e raised to al,

128
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,080
alpha a plus b the 8 times, eba, ebai,
that's your score.

129
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,730
That's one terminated denominator.

130
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,280
That represents the odds being
amenorrheic.

131
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,640
We are also going to put in the
denominator the odds of

132
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,000
being oligomenorrheic.

133
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,940
And then, we are going to put a one.

134
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,210
Basically now we have three things in the
denominator.

135
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,870
This represents your odds of being
eumenorrheic, of being oligomenorrheic,

136
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,680
and being amenorrheic.

137
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,110
You have to be one of those three things.

138
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,170
So to get the probability that you're one
of these three things, the probability of

139
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,160
being amenorrheic, we're just going to
move up the term that represents this,

140
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,360
these types of women in the numerator.

141
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:25,460
So, the amenorrheic women will get the
following.

142
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,110
The, it looks a lot like the probabilities
that we were fitting for

143
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,410
regular logistic regression but

144
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,660
we have three things in the denominator
now and three traces for the numerator.

145
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,524
The amenorrhea women, their probability
would be e raised to alpha a,

146
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:43,120
plus beta a, times their edi score, over
this denominator.

147
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,740
That's for the amenorrheic women.

148
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,910
There's 13 of them.
The oligomenorrheic women, they're

149
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,690
going to have the same denominator, so the
combination of these three types of women.

150
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:03,900
But in the numerator, they're going to get
the term

151
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,260
that represents the oligomenorrheaic
women, this is the odd of oligomenorrhea.

152
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:14,060
So that, if you divide this by the
denominator you get,

153
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,470
you're going to actually get the
probability of being oligomenorrheic.

154
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,870
All the women who are oligomenorrheic,
they are 37 of them will get this term in

155
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,120
the likelihood of course with their
individual scores plugged in.

156
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,170
The eumenorrheic women will have the same
denominator but

157
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,140
with a one in the numerator.

158
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,788
So those will be all

159
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:38,540
the different terms in the likelihood.

160
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,580
So now there's three kinds of terms in the
likelihood.

161
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,390
We're going to use that likelihood to
again solve for those alphas and betas.

162
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,450
Now the one thing that's a little bit
different here than what I showed you on

163
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,080
the previous slide, is that we've had, we
have an additional constraint that's been

164
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,090
applied by putting all of these women
together in the same model.

165
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,080
And that constraint is that we have our,

166
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,300
we know the probability of being
amenorrheic Plus the probability of being

167
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,930
oligomenorrheic plus the probability of
eumenorrheic, that has to sum up to one.

168
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,450
That's a constraint that didn't exist when
we ran separate models.

169
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,180
When we ran the separate models,

170
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,080
then the probability of being amenorrheic
plus the probability of eumen,

171
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,030
being eumenorrheic had to add up to one in
the first model.

172
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:26,040
And then separately the probability of
being [UNKNOWN] plus the probability of

173
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,850
being [UNKNOWN] also had up to had to add
up to one in their own model but

174
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,040
their was no constraint on all three
probabilities.

175
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,220
So that's why when you run everybody
together in a single multi

176
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,420
nomial regression you actually do get
slightly different values because of

177
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,010
this additional constraint but that's what
the likelihood function looks like.

178
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,570
I just want you to see it.

179
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,540
So that you have some picture of what's
going on behind the scenes and

180
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,210
what's slightly different about doing
multinomial logistic regression

181
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,510
than regular logistic regression.

182
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,030
Also, you need to know these terms in the
likelihood because in order to calculate,

183
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:03,440
to be able to calculate individual women's
predictive probabilities.

184
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,230
So, we are now, we are going to actually
calculate predictive probability.

185
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,660
For each woman.

186
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,470
Every woman gets three predicted
probability because there're

187
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,060
three possible outcomes now.

188
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,460
So what's the predicted probability of
being amonorea?

189
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,280
Well, that's just the, the term that I
showed you from the likelihood from

190
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,760
the previous slide except yeah, we've
actually fit the model.

191
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,860
We actually know what the alphas and the
betas are.

192
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,330
So the alpha for the intercept for the
amenorrheic women is negative 31.9.

193
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,950
The data was 0.1656.

194
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,460
So, I just actually plugged in the actual
values for the alphas and the betas now.

195
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,950
This will give me the predictive
probability of the amenorrheic.

196
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,690
The next term will give me the predictive
probability of being oligomenorrheic and

197
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,710
the last one will give me the predictive
probability of being eumenorrheic.

198
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:50,530
Let me just actually plug in a particular
score, edi score to show how this works.

199
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:56,610
So say that a woman has an eating disorder
score of nine we would plug her

200
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,120
value into each one of these terms to get
her predicted probabilities.

201
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,440
For all three possible outcomes.

202
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,100
When I plug in nine to the term, the
predictive probability being amenorrhea,

203
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,596
I get a value of about 10 or 11%.

204
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:13,850
So she has a 10 or 11% chance of being
amenorrheic according to our model.

205
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,610
She has a 30 about 31% chance of being
oligomenorrheic.

206
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,050
According to our model and about a 58%
chance of being eumenorrheic.

207
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,810
Now, notice if I add up those three
probabilities, they will have to sum to 1.

208
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,200
So, that's that additional constraint in
there.

209
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,710
Now, just to show you in the actual data
set when we are not accounting for

210
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,820
the eating disorder score.

211
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:40,379
Well remember there was a 13 out of a 150
women who are a,

212
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:46,680
amenorrheic and 24 out of a 150 women were
eumenorrheic.

213
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,874
So, so about 8% for amenorrheic and about
24% oligomenorrheic.

214
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:55,644
So if you knew nothing about the women,
your, the predicted probability for

215
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:59,704
a random woman where we didn't know her
eating disorder score, her probability of

216
00:12:59,704 --> 00:13:03,670
being amenorrheic would be about eight or
nine percent and her probability.

217
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,540
being, amenorrhea could be about 24%.

218
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,340
Now, this woman because she has a, an
elevated score.

219
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,050
She has a higher predictive probability of
having one of

220
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,610
these menstrual irregularities.

221
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,540
Now, you are not going to have to

222
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,580
calculate these predictive probabilities
by hand.

223
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,040
Obviously, it's a little cumbersome.

224
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,720
But the computer will go through and will
calculate these predicted probabilities

225
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,510
for every woman in your data set and so
I've done that here and

226
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,960
I'm just showing you a subset of the
predicted probabilities so

227
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,800
woman who had EDIA scores of nine had
these predicted probabilities which I

228
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,940
just showed you on the previous slide.

229
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,080
Women who had edi scores of 11 would have
even higher predictive probabilities of

230
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,410
being either amenorrheic or
oligomenorrheic.

231
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,860
Lower probability of being in the
reference group.

232
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,210
And so on, if you go down to the highest
possible eating disorder, which was 21.

233
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,960
Those amen would have three, 32% chance,
almost a third chance

234
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,310
of being amenerrheic of 43% chance of
being oligamanerrheic only less than a 25%

235
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,480
chance of having a normal period of your
score is so high on that eating disorder.

236
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:03,980
Scale.

237
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,660
We can then take the predictive
probabilities and

238
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,310
then actually graph them.

239
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,080
And I think the graph is very visually
useful.

240
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,990
So what this graph is showing you is here
is the EDI,

241
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,750
the eating disorder score on the X axis.

242
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,180
It goes again from zero to 21.

243
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,395
On the Y axis we're showing, all the
predicted probabilities,

244
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:28,480
[SOUND]
for the three groups.

245
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,630
So, this is your predicted probability.

246
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,970
eumenorrheic your predicted probabiliy in
red, of being oligomenorrheaic.

247
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,610
And your predicted probability in blue.

248
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,510
Of being amenorrheaic.

249
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,300
So if you have a very low eating disorder
score, if you have a score of zero,

250
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,570
you have a very low probability of being
amenorrheaic,

251
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,220
still some probability of being
oligomenorrheaic, but

252
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,770
not high, and you're most likely going to
be, have a normal cycle.

253
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,150
As you go up in EDIA score,

254
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,950
what you see happens is there's a drop in
your chances of having a normal cycle.

255
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,680
There's an increase in your chances of
having one of these two

256
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,330
menstrual irregularities, but you'll
notice that the curve for amenorrhea goes

257
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,990
up more steeply than the curve for
aligametareia that's because there's

258
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,270
a tighter relationship between this eating
disorder score and your chances of being

259
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,700
amatareiac than there is between the score
and your chances of being aligamaneriac.

260
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:21,160
So this is just a nice way to kind of
visually summarize our logistic or

261
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,405
multinomial logistic regression model.

262
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:27,932
[SOUND]
