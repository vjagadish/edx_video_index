[BLANK_AUDIO].

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,530
In this next module,

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,340
I'm going to give you a brief overview of
the various statistical tests and

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,200
strategies that are available for
analyzing repeated measures outcomes.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,719
So there's a number of ways that you can
handle repeated measures outcomes.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,640
The simplest thing you can do, is
essentially to not handle the repeated

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,870
outcome by simplifying it, collapsing it,
or ignoring it.

8
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,590
And you'll see that this actually fairly
widely done in the literature.

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,190
Probably because these tests have been
around longer, and they're simpler, so

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,610
people tend to feel more comfortable with
it.

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,410
So, for example, one strategy is you could
collapse that

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,940
repeated outcome measurement into a single
value.

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,330
So that each subject only has one value,
say by calculating a slope, or

14
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,490
a percent change or an average for every
person.

15
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,730
You can also just focus on one
measurement.

16
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,530
Usually we focus on the final measurement
because, you know,

17
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,080
often we care about what happens at the
end of the day.

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,360
So only compare the final measurement
between subjects.

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,730
Running say an ANCOVA, adjusting for

20
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,110
baseline differences, that's called an
end-point analysis.

21
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,220
So there's a number of ways you could
simplify the picture.

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,000
These methods of course, lose some
information because you

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,170
were kind of again simplifying or ignoring
the repeated outcome.

24
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,830
A second strategy which is also been
around for a long time, and

25
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,190
you'll see in the literature, is to use
some kind of repeated measures ANOVA.

26
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,510
And I'll review how to do a repeated
measures ANOVA this week.

27
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,890
Repeated measures ANOVA is somewhat
limited.

28
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,580
It's an ANOVA, so you have to have a
categorical predictor in there.

29
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,290
There's also some fairly restrictive
assumptions.

30
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,370
And you have to fill in missing data, and
things like that, but again,

31
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,070
sometimes a simple method is easy to get
your head around, so, and

32
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,580
you'll see these a lot in the literature,
so I'll show you that, those this week.

33
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,220
The more sophisticated methods, we're
going to go over in the next two weeks,

34
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,060
and those are the generalized estimating
equations in the mixed models.

35
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,470
These are more sophisticated ways of
handling repeated measures outcome.

36
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,390
They're going to have, they're, they're a
lot more powerful.

37
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,880
There's a lot more you can do with them.

38
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,150
They're going to have a lot of advantages
over the other strategies.

39
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,930
The advantages of what I'd call the
old-fashioned method,

40
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,960
sort of the simplifying or, or ignoring
repeated measures or

41
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,236
even, I would lump in there, the repeated
measures ANOVA or

42
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:23,320
the old methods, their, their advantage
really is that they're simple.

43
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,310
It's easy to kind of see what's happening,
get your head around those.

44
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,460
They're easier to understand and

45
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,330
implement, people tend to be more familiar
with these methods, and

46
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,210
so, again, that's why you might see them
widely in the literature.

47
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,970
Simplicity can be a good thing.

48
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,420
So if you're doing a more fancy model like
a mixed model, and

49
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,610
you're not quite sure that you've modeled
everything correctly,

50
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,530
it's perfectly fine to run a simple model
as well to kind of just serve as a check.

51
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,070
You shouldn't get wildly different answers
in the simple model.

52
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,080
GEE and mixed models, however, have many,
many advantages that we're going to see,

53
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,670
as, as we start talking about them, in the
next two weeks.

54
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,430
So, one of the advantages is that if
you're doing most of

55
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,780
the simple strategies, including repeated
measures in ANOVA,

56
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,410
you need to have complete data on each
subject.

57
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,930
For example in the repeated measures in
ANOVA, if a subject is missing data from

58
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,870
just one time frame, they're going to be
completely omitted from the analysis,

59
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,860
unless, you do something to impute their
missing data.

60
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,180
So you need to fill in the missing data,
or at least grapple with it.

61
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,820
GEE and mixed models have a way of
handling missing data

62
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,600
that doesn't require you to necessarily
impute.

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,790
The other thing about GEE and

64
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,390
mixed models, another thing, is that they
treat time as continuous.

65
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,900
So you'll see this week when we talk about
repeated measures ANOVA,

66
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,850
we're essentially treating time as
categorical.

67
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,450
Everybody has to be measured at the same
time points, and we are not allowing for

68
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,470
uneven spacing in when people were
measured.

69
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,190
So that's a limitation of, of the simple
methods.

70
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,180
GEE and its models are great because you
just treat time as a continuous variable.

71
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,910
GEE and mixed models can handle
time-changing predictors,

72
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,370
which none of the simpler methods can.

73
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,770
They also tend to have less restrictive
assumptions,

74
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,830
because they're more sophisticated you can
build in some complexities.

75
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,600
So for example, repeated-measures ANOVA,
as we'll see this week, requires

76
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,350
a particular correlation structure, an
exchangeable correlation structure.

77
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,990
GEE and mixed models don't necessarily
require that.

78
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,250
So, there's, there's huge number of
advantages that you'll see as I

79
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,170
introduce these more sophisticated models
in the next few weeks.
