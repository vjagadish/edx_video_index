1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,030
In this module, I want to show you how to
create a simple box plot,

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,190
as well as a simple histogram.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,730
>> Say we wanted to create a box plot for

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,640
the white variable, and that we wanted one
plot for males, and one plot for females.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,060
We'll start our code with PROC SGPLOT, and
then specify your data set.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,610
In the second line of code we write, hbox.

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,000
Hbox stands for horizontal box.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,920
This statement tells SAS that we want a
box plot.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,850
We then specify the variable for which you
want to make a box plot.

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,889
In our case we're interested in weight.

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,590
Remember, we want to make a separate plot
for males and females.

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,400
We can do this by adding a forward slash,
followed by category equals gender.

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,760
If you ever forget this syntax,

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,100
you can always check back on the online
SAS documentation.

15
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,960
Let's run the code and look at the output.

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,590
As you can see we now have a separate box
plot for males and for females.

17
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,220
>> Now I'll show you how to create a
histogram.

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,130
As you can see from our code,

19
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,000
our first line has not changed from our
previous example.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,480
And our second line we have now specified
histogram followed by

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,520
the variable we want to analyze, which in
this case is h.

22
00:01:13,218 --> 00:01:13,810
In unit three,

23
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,780
we showed you how to use PROC univariate
to create a histogram for you data.

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,210
PROC SGPLOT is nice for

25
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,030
making a histogram, if you need some extra
graphic options.

26
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,723
Let's take a look at the default
histogram.

27
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:31,808
[SOUND] Now let's take a look at a
histogram with some optional commands.

28
00:01:31,808 --> 00:01:36,309
[SOUND].

29
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:38,194
>> So this is what the default histogram
will look like.

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,780
And this is what a histogram can look like
if you use some of

31
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,815
the optional commands for the PROC SGPLOT
statement.

32
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:46,900
>> [SOUND]

33
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,460
The more you start experimenting with
graphics,

34
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,670
you'll probably realize that sometimes the
graphics can get a little glitchy.

35
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,955
If you make a title on one plot, it might
carry over onto all your other plots.

36
00:01:57,955 --> 00:02:00,480
[SOUND]

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,580
>> For example, in this code, we have two
plots.

38
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,070
The first one doesn't have a title, but
the second one does.

39
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,170
When we run it, we have a title for both
of them.

40
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,980
By adding GOptions, reset equals all,

41
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,800
before each line of code, will flush

42
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,250
out any graphic settings, so that each
plot will be made from a clean slate.

43
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,790
[BLANK_AUDIO]

44
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,720
Now the plots will look just like the way
we wanted it.

45
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,190
>> Before we end this module,

46
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,240
let's talk a little bit about online SAS
documentation for graphics.

47
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,850
Let's open up our web browser and search
PROC SGPLOT, and

48
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,109
open up our first option from SAS.

49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,360
We can then open the procedure syntax on
the left,

50
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,730
and pick the histogram statement.

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,380
As we can see on this page, we have all
the options for the histogram statement.

52
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,839
All the options will come after a forward
slash.

53
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,670
After the forward slash, we can use any of
these options here.

54
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,180
If we wanted to change the color for

55
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,050
example, we could use this fill attribute
statement.

56
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,700
We use fill attributes equals, color
equals, and then specify a color.

57
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,460
That's just what we did right here.

58
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,530
Fill attributes equals color equals
lavender, and we had that in parenthesis.

59
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,730
That's what made this histogram lavender
as opposed to this one,

60
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,490
which was a light blue.

61
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,040
>> If you ever want to modify your
graphics and

62
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,820
customize certain aspects, feel free to
use this online documentation.

63
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,120
It'll provide with all the code necessary
to make professional graphics.
