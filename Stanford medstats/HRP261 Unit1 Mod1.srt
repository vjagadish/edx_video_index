1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,450
In this next module,

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,420
I'm going to review the statistical test
that we can use when we want to analyze

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,540
data in the two by two table specifically
when we have independent observations.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,800
Uncorrelated data.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,370
That's the most common situation.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,240
So, on this module, I'm going to be
talking about the risk difference and

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,370
relative risks, that is odds ratio and

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,730
risk ratios, as well as the chi-squared
test because,

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,213
of course, the chi-squared test can also
be applied to a two by two table.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,730
The example I'm going to be using for this
module, there's some data that comes from

11
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,370
a randomized control trial of probiotic
supplementation during pregnancy.

12
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:47,630
So, pregnant women were supplemented with
probiotics, or given a placebo.

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,040
And the idea was that this might prevent
eczema in the infant.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,600
So after the infant was born,

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,110
they might be less likely to get eczema
during the first year of life.

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,260
So, that's the data that's shown here.

17
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,130
This table's got a lot of stuff in it, so,
what I'm going to do for

18
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,720
now is just zoom in on the unadjusted
part, just kind of the raw numbers.

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,420
So, the outcome here was a binary outcome.

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,870
The infant either got eczema, some point
during the first year of their life, or

21
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,910
they did not.

22
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,410
We had two groups: a probiotics groups,

23
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,470
that where the mother got the probiotics
during pregnancy, or a placebo group.

24
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,130
There were 33 in the, in the probiotics
group and 35 in the placebo group.

25
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,980
And you can see, if you just look at the
raw numbers here, that indeed, fewer

26
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,410
infants in the probiotics group got eczema
sometime during the first year of life.

27
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,930
The p-value for the difference here is
0.029.

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,860
I'm going to walk you through where that
p-value comes from now.

29
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,370
So we can put these data into a nice
little two by two table.

30
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,070
Everything in this module is going to be
about analyzing data from a simple two

31
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,270
by two table.

32
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,690
So we have a Treatment group and

33
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,440
a Placebo group, and the infant either got
eczema or they didn't.

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,850
So two binary and, binary outcome of
binary predictor here.

35
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,370
You can see that 36% of it treatment group
got eczema versus 62.9% of

36
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,560
the placebo group.

37
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,190
If we want to compare those two numbers,
those two proportions or

38
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,660
risks we're going to do what's called a
difference in proportions z test.

39
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,660
You might also call it a risk difference.

40
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,270
So this is very simple, we just.

41
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,890
We have a two observed proportions, and we
want to compare them and to see whether or

42
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,470
not we can reject the null hypothesis that
those proportions are equal.

43
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,870
Difference in proportions follows a normal
distribution so

44
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,060
we are going to be calculating a z square
here, so

45
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,120
that's the z squared because we know that
proportions follow a normal distribution.

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,160
We're going to just be putting in

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,400
the numerator here the observed difference
that 36% versus the 63%.

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,770
That's what we observed we're going to
compare that to this standard error of

49
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,590
the difference.

50
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,600
The standard error of the difference is
this formula here.

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,240
Hopefully this is familiar to all of you.

52
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,350
It just comes from the fact that we have
proportions coming from two roots.

53
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,160
That's why we have sort of two items here
under that square root.

54
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,810
And then the variability,

55
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,960
the standard deviation of a proportion is
related to p times 1 minus p.

56
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,680
Now, a small little subtle note in here
for our hypothesis test,

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,150
we're going to use what's called p bar.

58
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,070
That's just the pooled proportion.

59
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,240
All that means is it's nothing
complicated.

60
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,550
It just means we're going to look at the
total proportion of people who had

61
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,940
the outcome in our total sample, ignoring
group.

62
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,240
In other words, how many infants, overall
got eczema?

63
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,580
In this case, it was 34 out of 68 infants
got eczema, so

64
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,020
our pooled proportion in this case, is
just 0.5.

65
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,430
The reason we use a pooled proportion is
because our null hypothesis

66
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,120
here is at the.

67
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,870
Two proportions are equal,

68
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,695
therefore we're assuming that there's a
single proportion here.

69
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:45,790
When, we don't have different proportions
in the two groups,

70
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,510
we're assuming they're equal, therefore we
can just pool them and plug in p bar here.

71
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,620
That gives us a z score.

72
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,880
We can then look up the p-value that goes
with that.

73
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,620
So that's to test the hypothesis of
whether or

74
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,600
not the, those two proportions are equal.

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,920
We can also build a 95% confidence in all
for the difference in proportions.

76
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,300
We do that by, take the point estimate,

77
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,382
the observe difference in proportions
which is about 0.6, 0.5% here.

78
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,301
Add or subtract 1.96.

79
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:15,180
The 1.96 comes from the fact that we're on
a z distribution.

80
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,240
And then we multiply that by the standard
error.

81
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,680
A small subtlety here is that notice when
I'm doing the confidence interval.

82
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,800
I'm plugging in the individual proportions
from the individual groups.

83
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,610
So notice that these proportions are the
actually the observe proportions in

84
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,450
each group.

85
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,370
I'm plugging in the different proportions.

86
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,460
The 30.

87
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,030
6% versus the 63% here.

88
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,780
Rather than the pooled proportion.

89
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,200
Simply because we have no assumption when
we're building the oncifdance interval

90
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,400
that those two proportions are going to be
equal.

91
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,070
Now if you plugin the pool proportion here
on

92
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,940
the observe proportions in the hypothesis.

93
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,180
It's not going to make a huge difference
in your estimates.

94
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,610
It's only going to make a subtle tiny
little difference.

95
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,810
And for the most part, after this week,
you'll just be doing this on a computer.

96
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,930
And the computer will take care of that
detail for you.

97
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,690
But I just want to point out that subtle
difference here.

98
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,340
So I, I want you now to go ahead and run
the hypothesis test.

99
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,930
Calculate the z score.

100
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,610
That z score should, of course, come out
ca-, correlating to a p value of 0.029.

101
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,550
Calculate the z score here for the
difference in proportions.

102
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,910
I actually want you to pause the video and
try this on your own.

103
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,460
And then restart the video and I'll walk
you through it again.

104
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,640
I'm assuming that this is largely review
for most of you.

105
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,930
Alright, so this is fairly straight
forward.

106
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,840
Again, we are just going to apply that
formula where we are calculating a z

107
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,410
score based on our observed difference.

108
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,480
So our observed difference is 62.9% minus
36.4%.

109
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,640
I'm putting the larger group first, just
so

110
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,080
that I don't end, end up with a negative.

111
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,220
It doesn't matter whether you make it
negative or positive.

112
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,750
So I'm avoiding dealing with the negative.

113
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,170
And then my standard error is going to be
p times 1 minus p.

114
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,680
Again I'm going to use the pooled
proportion.

115
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,086
Just half the infants got eczema overall.

116
00:05:55,086 --> 00:06:00,990
So that's 0.5 times 1 minus 0.5 divided by
the sample size in one group

117
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,550
plus 0.5 times 1 minus 0.5 divided by the
sample size in the second group.

118
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,000
If you just run through the actual math on
that, crank that into a calculator,

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,380
you'll see that the z score comes out to
be 2.18.

120
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,190
We call know that if the z score's above
1.96.

121
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,120
That's going to be statistically
significant at the point of five level.

122
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,980
Indeed, if you go to a z calculator, you
will,

123
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,120
in fact, find that the p value that
corresponds to a z value of 2.18 is 0.029,

124
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,110
exactly what the authors reported in their
paper.

125
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,640
That's the two tail p value, and of
course,

126
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,720
we're going to want to use the two tail p
value here, because there's no reason.

127
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,000
That the probiotics couldn't of actually
increased the risk of eczema that could,

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,480
that's biologically possible.

129
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,580
Now, I'm just going to show you some
output from a computer program.

130
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,300
I plugged these data into SAS and just to
show you what you get out of SAS,

131
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,750
the key value that's associated with a
difference in proportion.

132
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,950
Now notice that where I'm actually getting
this out of

133
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,750
this SAS output point is chi-square.

134
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,280
It doesn't say difference in proportions
z-test, but

135
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,320
notice the p value is exactly the same as
we just calculated.

136
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,990
In fact, mathematically,

137
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,990
the chi square test from a two by two
table is mathematically equivalent to

138
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,490
the difference in proportion z-test that
we just did.

139
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,180
So we will get exactly the same p value.

140
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,120
So in fact, in sas there's no separate
line for

141
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,117
that, you just take the p-value from the
chi-square.

142
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:28,900
Alright, now I want you to attempt to
build the 95% confidence interval for

143
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,810
the risk difference using the formula that
I already gave you.

144
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,270
Again, pause the video, see if you can do
this on your own, because again,

145
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,620
this should be review, and then restart
the video and I'll walk you through it.

146
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,010
Okay, so to build the 95% confidence
interval here,

147
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,840
we're just going to use the observed
difference in proportion, which was 26.5%.

148
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,741
That is if I subtract 62.9% minus 36.4%.

149
00:07:52,741 --> 00:07:53,610
I get 26.5%.

150
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,450
That's the risk difference.

151
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,800
The absolute risk difference between the
two groups.

152
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,690
I'm going to add and subtract from that
the 1.96 from the 95% confidence interval.

153
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,950
Times the standard error.

154
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,230
The standard error here.

155
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,360
Again, I'm going to plug in just the
observed proportions in each group.

156
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,320
So, 1 minus 0.364 and

157
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,670
the treatment group divided by 33.

158
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:27,480
Plus 0.629 times

159
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:35,780
1 minus 0.629, divided by 35 for the
placebo group.

160
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,030
If you crank out the math on that, this.

161
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,900
Standard error comes out to be about
0.117.

162
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,260
And so you add and subtract that from the
26.5%.

163
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:52,550
You end up with a confidence interval of
3.6% to 49.4%.

164
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,820
So indeed that confidence interval does
not cross zero.

165
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,610
So we're 95% sure that the true value is
not zero.

166
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,240
So in other words,

167
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,240
we can clearly reject the null hypothesis
that the two groups are the same.

168
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:10,890
If you want to get this in SAS, you can
ask for the risk diff option, and

169
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,226
it will actually give you you can see at
the bottom here, the difference in risk.

170
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:19,980
And the conf-, the standard error and the
95% confidence interval,

171
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,970
these are exactly as we calculated in the
last slide, except for

172
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,860
that their SAS goes out to a few more
decimal places.

173
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,500
I'll just note that SAS says something
about it

174
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,230
being an asymptotic 95% confidence limit.

175
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,310
All that means.

176
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,790
Is that we are assuming that we have a
large enough sample that it's okay to

177
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,290
approximate the binomial with the normal.

178
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,910
That's essentially what we're doing when
we calculate standard in

179
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,450
the way we just did in the last line.

180
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,000
That's probably fine here.

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,932
Our sample isn't terribly small for much
smaller samples you're

182
00:09:48,932 --> 00:09:52,880
going to want to instead use what is
called an exact 95% confidence limits.

183
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,160
That simply calculates the confidence
limit based on the exact

184
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,220
binomial probabilities rather than doing
any approximation.

185
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,270
SAS does not give this to you if you don't
ask.

186
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,080
I didn't ask here, but in cases where you
have small,

187
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,560
much smaller samples, you might want to
ask for those exact confidence limits.

188
00:10:09,872 --> 00:10:13,680
I want to also show you that you can also
use a chi-squared test to analyze a two by

189
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,560
two table.

190
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,640
I'm, again, assuming that most of you have
seen a chi-square test before, so

191
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,590
this would be largely review.

192
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,010
So, how do we do a chi-squared test for a
contingency table?

193
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,850
We need to calculate, we have the observed
table on the top here.

194
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,350
We need to calculate the expected counts
in order to run a chi-squared test.

195
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,580
So where do those expected counts come
from?

196
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,990
Well, the null hypothesis here is that
which group you're in, treatment versus

197
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,620
control, is unrelated, is independent
from, whether or not you get eczema.

198
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,270
So we can say that there, the two, our two
variables, call them A and B.

199
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:51,530
So A being what treatment group you're in,
B being whether or not you get eczema.

200
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,210
So we're going to say that those two
variables are independent of one another.

201
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,540
And in statistics, being independent means
statistically,

202
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,330
that your joint probability, the
probability of both of

203
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,450
those things happening is equal to the
product of the marginal probabilities.

204
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,790
That's what statistical independence is
defined as.

205
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:14,350
So in other words, if these two variables
are independent, then the likelihood that

206
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,070
you have both things happen that you're
both in the treatment group and

207
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,370
that you get eczema.

208
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,010
Should be equal to the probability of
getting eczema overall,

209
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,304
the marginal probability of getting
eczema, tied up time,

210
00:11:24,304 --> 00:11:26,990
times the marginal probability of being in
the treatment group.

211
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,940
So that's the, the theory that we're
going to use to

212
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,170
calculate the expected values here under
the null hypothesis.

213
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,920
So, if the null hypothesis is true, and we
do indeed have independence,

214
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,610
then it should be the case that your
chance of being in this cell,

215
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:45,840
the treated and get eczema cell should be
equal to 34 out of 68.

216
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,670
That's your marginal probability of
getting eczema.

217
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,510
Where did I get that?

218
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,130
That just comes right from the margins.

219
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,540
Times your chance of being in the
treatment group was actually 33 out of 69.

220
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,850
The two groups were not.

221
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,240
Completely even here, there is a slightly
different sample size.

222
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,400
So, if we multiply those two probabilities
together,

223
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,290
that should give us the probability of
being in this particular cell,

224
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,770
what we call cell A, the treated plus gets
eczema group.

225
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,110
Now, in, for

226
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,270
doing chi-squared tests we actually don't
want the probability we want the counts.

227
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,510
So what I'm additionally going to do here
is I'm going to multiply by 68

228
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,280
by the total count.

229
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,550
If I multiply that probability by the
total count,

230
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,430
I'm going to get the count for that cell,
the expected count for that cell.

231
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,450
Notice one of the 68s will cancel.

232
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:32,620
So a very simple way to get these expected
values is just to take the row total and

233
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,500
the column total, multiply them together,
and then divide by the total sample size.

234
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,050
If you do that math, you get a value of
16.5.

235
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,640
So our expected value under the null
hypothesis,

236
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,170
if there's no relationship between
treatment and eczema, is 16.5.

237
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,360
Now notice that I don't have to do any
more multiplication.

238
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,280
To fill in the rest of this table.

239
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,610
So the marginal totals are fixed.

240
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,900
Those are not allowed to change.

241
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,310
The ones I've filled in,

242
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:01,360
the 16.5, I can subtract 34 minus 16.5 to
get this cell should be 17.5.

243
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,200
And then I subtract 35 minus 17.5 to be
able to fill in this cell.

244
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,870
And finally I subtract 33 minus 16.5 to be
able to fill in that cell.

245
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,710
So this table has what we call one degree
of freedom only.

246
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,460
That all that means is by the time I've
multiplied out to figure out one cell,

247
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,780
the rest of the cells are fixed, they
can't be anything else,

248
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,800
because of the fact that the marginals are
fixed.

249
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,260
So, this table only has one degree of
freedom which means I save myself work

250
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,800
cause I only have to really do any work
for one particular cell.

251
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,188
So those are the expected values for that
table, we're then going to

252
00:13:36,188 --> 00:13:40,838
apply the chi-square formula, to compare
the observed in the expected cells.

253
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:47,410
Notice that you know, there's a few more
people in the treatment,

254
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,470
there's, you know, in the expected value,
the treatment in eczema group has 16.5.

255
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,020
We actually observed only 12.

256
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,370
So there's a little bit fewer people in
the,

257
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,970
infants in the treatment group with
eczema.

258
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,650
So it's a little bit different than the
observed.

259
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,310
Is it enough to be statistically
significant?

260
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,400
And we can answer that question by
applying the chi-squared formula, so

261
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,990
this is just if we're going to add up for

262
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,250
all the sales observed minus expected
squared divided by the expected.

263
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:12,950
And I went ahead and

264
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,670
plugged all those numbers in from the four
sales on the previous slide.

265
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:21,005
When you calculate that out, you get a
value of 4.77 for the chi-squared.

266
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:25,060
This is a chi-squared with one degree of
freedom for the reasons I just mentioned.

267
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,680
Just know the other way to know the
degrees of freedom.

268
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,670
For a contingency table is, you do, rows
minus 1 times columns minus 1.

269
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,330
In this case, we have two rows and we have
two columns,

270
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,870
because it's a two by two table, so our
degrees or freedom will be 1.

271
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,500
So that's your shorthand for figuring out
the degrees of freedom.

272
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,550
Achi-square with one degree of freedom, if
that value is 4.77,

273
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,238
if you go look that up in a.

274
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:51,820
Chart a chi-square chart you will find
that you get a p value of

275
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,930
exactly 0.029 exactly what we got from the
difference in proportions test, and

276
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,210
notice that if you go back and look at the
z value.

277
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,940
That we got from the difference in
proportions test.

278
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,300
That was 2.18.

279
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,310
If you square that,

280
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:09,208
you get exactly 4.77 with a little there
may be some rounding error in there.

281
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:14,430
So, the chi-square with one degree of
freedom comes out to be exactly the square

282
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,990
of the z statistic that we calculated from
the difference in proportions.

283
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,710
In fact, you can prove that those tests,
even though the formulas look

284
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,010
very different, they're mathematically
equivalent,

285
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,100
the chi-square is just the square of
disease statistic.

286
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,350
They're mathematically the same.

287
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:33,260
And just as a note, the chi-square
distribution in fact, if you take the z

288
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,480
distribution and you square it, that is a
chi-square with one degree of freedom.

289
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,230
And I'll talk a little more about that
when we get to the module on chi-squares.

290
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,140
But just note a chi-square distribution is
defined as a chi-square with one

291
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,320
degrees freedom is defined as a standard
normal variable squared.

292
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,800
So there's a direct relationship there.

293
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,270
And again, the chi-square test for a two
by table,

294
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:59,030
mathematically equivalent to the z test or
that the difference in proportions.

295
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:06,590
And so that's why in SAS we actually just
use the p-value from the chi-squared test.

296
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,830
So again, here is that p-value from the
chi-squared test.

297
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,500
It comes out to be 0.29.

298
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,199
We already saw this output.

299
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,100
Now, other things that you can calculate
from a two by two table that I need to

300
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,620
mention, what we've calculated so far are
absolute risks differences.

301
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,590
We've looked at the absolute of eczema in
each group.

302
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,090
Arguably the absolute risks are more
relevant.

303
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,980
To patients and to people, it, people can
understand the absolute risks

304
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,780
more easily and they're less likely to be
misleading.

305
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,890
So I encourage people to report absolute
risks in their papers whenever possible.

306
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,540
However, if you look at the medical
literature,

307
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,530
in fact you'll much more commonly see the
relative risks reported.

308
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,580
Things like risk ratios and odds ratios,
so

309
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,460
I'm going to talk a little bit about what
those are.

310
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,520
Again, I'm assuming you've seen these
before so

311
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,130
I'm going to go through this rather
quickly.

312
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,680
So, what is a risk ratio?

313
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,588
A risk ratio is just a ratio of two risks,
so it's very, very simple to calculate.

314
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:06,960
We're just going to take the risk of
getting eczema in the treated group,

315
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,900
that goes in the numerator, we're going to
compare that to the risk of getting

316
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,820
eczema in the reference group, the control
group that goes in the denominator.

317
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,570
That gives us a relative risk of 0.58.

318
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:24,230
That's interpreted as we can say there's a
42% decrease in the relative risk Risk, of

319
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,660
getting eczema if you were in the treated
group versus the control group here.

320
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,230
I'm not going to go through the math on
how I

321
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,340
calculated the 95% confidence interval.

322
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,630
It's, it's not hard to do, but

323
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,830
it's a little tedious, so we'll just let
the computer calculate it out for us.

324
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,880
I'll just note that the 95% confidence
interval here.

325
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,020
Does not cross one, and for

326
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,000
a risk ratio, a value of one would
indicate no difference between the groups.

327
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,850
That's the null value.

328
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,570
So, the fact that it doesn't cross one
tells you that it's going to be

329
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,980
a statistically significant risk ratio.

330
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,080
Risk ratio is very straightforward, makes
absolute sense in the contexts of

331
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,090
these data that we're looking at to report
the risk ratio.

332
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,790
However, when you actually go and look at
the table that I showed you earlier,

333
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,030
we're going to look at it more detailed in
a minute.

334
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,210
You'll see that authors don't report the
risk ratio,

335
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,460
they report something called the odds
ratio.

336
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,780
Now the odds ratio is this very funny
measure that is going to come up,

337
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,540
all the time in the medical literature, as
well as, in this class, for

338
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,470
reasons I will get to.

339
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,050
The odds ratio is literally a ratio of two
odds.

340
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,500
So, what's an odd?

341
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,460
An odd is the risk of something happening,
divided by the risk of it not happening.

342
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,710
That's what an odds is.

343
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,410
Probability divided by 1 minus the
probability.

344
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,952
So in other words, if the risk of
something happening is say 25%,

345
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:43,800
then your odds is going to be 1 to 3.

346
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,000
There's one chance of it happening for
every three chances of it not happening.

347
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,460
So it's the probability divided by 1 minus
the probability.

348
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,220
So, 25% divided by 75%, or 1 to 3.

349
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:59,010
So we're going to make a ratio of two odds
here.

350
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,230
So what are the, what's the odds of
getting eczema in the treatment group?

351
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:08,390
Well, the risk of getting eczema in the
treatment group is 36.4%, so the odds of

352
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,650
getting eczema in the treatment group is
going to be the probability of getting it

353
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,330
divided by the probability of not getting
it, which is 1 minus 36.4%.

354
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,920
Again, very funny measure, most of us
don't think in odds.

355
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,170
Odds happen to have some nice mathematical
properties,

356
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,930
however, which is why the odds ratio comes
up.

357
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,720
So, the numerator is the odds of getting
eczema for the treated group.

358
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,550
The denominator, similarly, is the odds of
getting eczema in the control group.

359
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,660
So, 62.9% divided by 1 minus minus that.

360
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,250
When you calculate that all out, you get
this value 0.34.

361
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,670
What does that value actually mean?

362
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:51,160
Well, you would interpret this, as a, 66%
decrease in the relative odds.

363
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,580
Of getting eczema.

364
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,880
And if you tell that to a patient, if you
tell to that a person, you know,

365
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,470
you're going to decrease your odds by 66%,

366
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,180
nobody is really going to know what you
mean by that.

367
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,880
Most of us are use to thinking in chances,
probabilities or risks, not in odds.

368
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,450
So this can lead to some the odds ratio
can lead to mis-interpretations.

369
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,960
It can be misleading.

370
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,100
Because you might see this 0.34 and

371
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,380
think that that means a 66% decrease in
your risk, but it does not.

372
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,760
I'm going to talk more in the next module
about being careful about

373
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,670
interpreting odds ratios.

374
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,710
Notice the 95% confidence interval for the
odds ratio is also here.

375
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,830
I'll show you in the next module how to
calculate that.

376
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,460
But again, it does not cross one,

377
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,830
that tells you that it is statistically
significant.

378
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,920
Now again, you're probably wondering,

379
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,150
if you've never seen odds ratios before,
or even if you have seen them,

380
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,000
you're probably wondering why do we ever
use odds ratios?

381
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,260
Well there, there's some, there are some
reasons for that.

382
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,850
But what I'll show you.

383
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,840
This is by the ways where you get this in
the SAS output though.

384
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,680
Just to show you that you

385
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,910
can get a computer to calculate these
things for you.

386
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,190
The computer, SAS automatically calculates
for

387
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,950
you the odds ratio as well as the risk
ratio.

388
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,720
It even tells you, well gee, you know,

389
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,260
you really only need the odds ratio if
your dealing with a case control study.

390
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,070
For a two by two table, but it gives you
those confidence limits so

391
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,830
it saves you having to calculate those by
hand,

392
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,190
again SAS has gone out to a few more
decimal places here.

393
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,310
I'll also just provide for you for those
of you who are interested,

394
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:17,220
the SAS code that I used to generate the
output in this module for

395
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,052
those of you who are interested in trying
this in SAS on your own.

396
00:21:21,052 --> 00:21:22,380
Here is SAS code.

397
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,520
I've actually entered the data as grouped
data so

398
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,090
all that means is notice that I only
really entered four lines of data code.

399
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:32,710
There's only four different types of
infants in this study.

400
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,810
And I've entered it as grouped data by
just giving it count so

401
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,560
I don't have to type this line 1112 times.

402
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,940
That's just a shorthand in SAS, or any
statistical program, for

403
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,340
entering data that's from, you know, a
contingency table.

404
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,428
So I'm just going to put that up there for
those who are interested.

405
00:21:48,428 --> 00:21:50,640
I don't want to dwell on it but

406
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,310
getting back now to that data from the
actual paper.

407
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,810
So here's that table three from the paper
again.

408
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,180
We already looked at the unadjusted
numbers, but

409
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,950
now I want to look at the highlighted area
here, the adjusted numbers and

410
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,770
this is where an odds ratio suddenly pops
up.

411
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,760
So, OR here stands for odds ratios so
that.

412
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,860
This is adjusted odds ratio.

413
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,330
So notice that even though it would make
total sense here to report a risk ratio,

414
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,300
because we've got risks, what you, in
fact,

415
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,530
what the others have in fact reported is
an odds ratio.

416
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,840
The reason they did that -

417
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,350
you can see the reason in the footnote for
this table, they say the p-value was

418
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,680
calculated by multivariable logistic
regression analysis.

419
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,240
So, the reason there's an odds ratio here
is because the authors have

420
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,810
a binary outcome and they want to adjust
for some confounders.

421
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,480
To do a statistical adjustment, we have to
use regression.

422
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,890
And the typical regression that people use
when you have a binary outcome,

423
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,670
is logistic regression.

424
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,760
Logistic regression is what we're going to
focus on a lot in this class,

425
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,050
but when you do a logistic regression,

426
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:55,040
what it gives you out at the end of the
day are odds ratios.

427
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,490
It does not give you risk ratios,

428
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,540
it gives you odds ratios, there's
mathematical reasons for that.

429
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,230
But the upshot is, because lots of people
do logistic regression,

430
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,930
there are lots of odds ratios floating
around in the literature and

431
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,140
we have to be very careful again about how
we look at these.

432
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,960
The reason the odds, this was a randomized
trials so,

433
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,670
arguably, the authors probably shouldn't
have needed to adjust for

434
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,210
confounding but perhaps they've adjusted
for antibiotic use.

435
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,510
Breastfeeding and caesarean section
perhaps those were slightly imbalanced in

436
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,390
these two groups since it was a small
randomized trial.

437
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,370
When they do the adjustment the odds ratio
goes down slightly so

438
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,700
the unadjusted odds ratio was 0.34.

439
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,170
It goes down to 0.24 when you adjust for
these other things.

440
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,870
The p value is about the same as before.

441
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,210
So we end up with an odds ratio and

442
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,620
again you have to be careful about you
interpret this.

443
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,680
So, you wouldn't want to look at this odds
ratio and

444
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,640
say, oh, well that means that after
adjusting for

445
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,460
these confounders there was a 76% decrease
in the risk of eczema.

446
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,060
This is a 76% decrease in the odds of
getting eczema.

447
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,160
Which, again, is a really hard thing for
us to understand intuitively.

448
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,380
All you have to do is look at the risks.

449
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,320
It's really a halving of risk, right?

450
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,250
The risk goes down by about half, from
about 63% to 36%.

451
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:06,035
So clearly, not a 76% drop in the risk.

452
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:08,140
76% drop in the odds, whatever that
exactly means.

453
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,120
Now, you might wonder, if you're looking
at this, you know,

454
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,530
adjusted odds ratio and say, well,oh,
well, maybe it's.

455
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,820
It's the fact that we've adjusted for
things.

456
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,860
Maybe that makes the relationship
stronger, and

457
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,930
in fact, if we adjusted these, you know,

458
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,940
the risk ratios somehow, that the risk
ratio would also appear much smaller.

459
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,730
In fact, that's not the case, and you can
show that, because of the fact that

460
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,510
the odds ratio and risk ratio have a
direct mathematical relationship.

461
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,030
So there's a little formula you can use,
if you were in HRP 259,

462
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,340
you've already done this before.

463
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,200
But there's a little formula you can use
to convert back the odds ratio from

464
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,330
a logistic regression,back into a adjusted
risk ratio.

465
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:50,070
Just using the mathematical relationship
between those two quantities.

466
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,500
I won't derive it for you here.

467
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,000
But it's fairly easy to apply.

468
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,780
So, we're just going to plug it, in this
case, to this formula.

469
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,540
The observed odds ratio is 0.243.

470
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,520
Now we have to plug in the risk, or

471
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,860
prevalence, of the outcome in the
reference group.

472
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,340
So in this case, the reference is that
control group.

473
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,110
62.9% Of them got eczema, so we plug in
the 0.629.

474
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,220
When you do that, you get that the
adjusted risk ratio is 0.46.

475
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,660
Remember, the unadjusted was 0.58, if we
just.

476
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,860
Just divided the the two percentages in
the two groups.

477
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,010
When we adjust it goes down slightly to
0.46,

478
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,040
but it's still about a halving of risk.

479
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,250
The risk is cut by about in half.

480
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:33,200
So it's the odds ratio again, of 0.24, is
very misleading.

481
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,800
You would not want to say that the risk is
reduced by 75% here.

482
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,140
The correct interpretation is that the
risk is cut in half.

483
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,410
And I'll talk a little bit more in the
next module about correctly interpreting

484
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:45,980
odds ratios.

485
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,610
Again, we're going to see odds ratios a
lot in this course,

486
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,480
simply because of the fact that we're
doing a lot of logistic regression.
