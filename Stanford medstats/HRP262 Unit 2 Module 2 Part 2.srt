1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,510
All right.
Let me show you something a little bit

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,130
more complicated.

3
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,510
The exponential is great because it's the
simplest of them.

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,130
But let me show one, one step more
complicated.

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,510
So, what if we have a hazard function that
was increasing?

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,440
And, what if that hazard function was
increasing in a very specific way?

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,070
So, what if the hazard function was equal
to point one, like we had before.

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,410
So, say a ten percent chance.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,165
But it was a 10% in the first month, and
then let's say,

10
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:30,250
their, your chances went up with each
sequent month.

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,610
So what I'm doing here, is I'm taking
time, and I'm raising it to .2.

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,810
This is just arbitrary.

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,550
I'm making this up.

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,740
But for whatever reason, imagine that
every month there's a little bit more and

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,970
more chance of getting pregnant or
whatever the event is.

16
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,414
I, I can't come up with exactly the
scenario here, but

17
00:00:45,414 --> 00:00:48,482
imagine that these women were in this
study had some treatment that was

18
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:52,140
slow acting and every month the, their
fertility went up a little bit.

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,375
So that's what we could, we could use as
the function here.

20
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:58,830
Lemmie just show you how this would work
again, kind of the same chart as

21
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,110
before it's a little bit more complicated
now because of the fact that the hazard is

22
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,460
increasing, changing over time, but we can
still do this kind of same calculation.

23
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,730
So imagine that that's the hazard rate and
we are starting with a 100 women and

24
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,870
we're looking for the probabilities for
pregnancy within 6 months.

25
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,510
So the number remaining at risk, this is
those that haven't gotten pregnant yet,

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,064
the instance of pregancies.

27
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:26,590
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,100
And women to our left.

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,320
So again, let's just go through this
calculation.

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,130
Sometimes it's helpful to

31
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,570
write something out like this to really
understand what's going on.

32
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,456
So in the first month, the hazard rate is
10%, the time is one, so

33
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:39,150
1 raised to .2 is still 1.

34
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,304
And so the hazard rate in the first month
is just 10%.

35
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:44,104
There were 100 women at risk, so

36
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,070
we're expecting about 10 of them, 10% of
100, to get pregnant.

37
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,170
Means 90 are left, that one's easy.

38
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,030
For 10.2, it's just slightly more
complicated.

39
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,204
Which is 10% times month two raised to
0.2.

40
00:01:57,204 --> 00:02:00,940
Well, 2 raised to 0.2 is 1.14,

41
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,680
that gives a hazard rate that's a little
bit higher it's 11.4% so

42
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,860
we're expecting about 11.4% of the other
women to get pregnant that month.

43
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,060
There are 90 women who are still at risk
of getting pregnant.

44
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,140
Well, 11% of 90 is actually still about
10, so

45
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,060
we're expecting 10 to get pregnant, 80 to
be left.

46
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:27,170
10.3, we do 3 raised to .2, which is 1.24,
giving us a hazard rate of 12.4%.

47
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,750
We are starting with 80 women; 12.4% of 80
is actually about 10, so

48
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,650
now we'd be down to 70.

49
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,670
Month 4, we do the same calculation.

50
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:41,160
4 raised to .2 is about 1.31, so it's a
13.1% hazard rate.

51
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,230
So you can see that every month the hazard
rate is increasing.

52
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,290
Now you have a 13% chance, if you're still
pregnancy free,

53
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,170
you have a 13% chance of getting pregnant
in this month.

54
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:55,040
And we had 70 women left, so 13% of 70 is
just about 9, so then we're down to 61.

55
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,800
In month 5, I'm going to just, to keep
things from getting too slow here,

56
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,770
I'm just going to write down what it comes
out to be.

57
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,450
So, 10%.

58
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,440
5 raised to the 0.2 power, that's going to
give me 13.8% hazard, a little bit higher.

59
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,230
61 women left and

60
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:15,220
so, therefore 13.8% of 61 is about 8 women
who will get pregnant; 53 are left.

61
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:22,565
And then for month 6, the rate comes out
to be 14.3% we are starting with 53 women,

62
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:27,680
14.3% of 53 is about 8, again, I'm
rounding just here to keep things simple.

63
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,730
We would then be left with about 45 women.

64
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,990
So that means that 45 women are left who
haven't got pregnant,

65
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,260
that means 55 have gotten pregnant So

66
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:42,300
the probability of pregnancy within 6
months is now about 55%.

67
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,410
It is higher because every month there was
a little bit more chance of

68
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,400
getting pregnant.

69
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,230
But the probability of not getting
pregnant within 6 months is 45%.

70
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,570
And what I just illustrated for you is
something called the Weibull distribution.

71
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,790
So if you have a hazard function that is
increasing with co, a constant times

72
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,620
T raised to a power, that will follow the
Weibull probability distribution.

73
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,940
So what you just illustrated was the
Weibull distribution.

74
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,210
So let me just write out the Weibull
distribution.

75
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,630
I don't want you to get bogged down.

76
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,610
There is a lot of parameters.

77
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,060
This can look a little complicated.

78
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,280
If you look this up on the internet,

79
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,370
you'll see that everybody uses different
symbols to

80
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,392
represent the Weibull function and they
represent it in slightly different ways.

81
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:29,710
I'm going to represent it in the simplest
way that I can think of to.

82
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,420
And I don't want you to get bogged down
with the details of the function or

83
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,220
worried about it too much when you are not
going to have to work with really Weibull

84
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,160
directly but I want you to have a concept
of what the Weibull function means.

85
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,460
So, again a hazard function for a Weibull,
this is just a way of

86
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,810
having a Hazard function increase over
time in some smooth mathematical way we're

87
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,480
multiplying by some function of time every
month or every year, every unit of time.

88
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,020
And I just want to show you actually that
the exponential distribution is

89
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,160
actually a special case of the Weibull
distribution.

90
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,210
So the exponential, which I told you
occurs when you have a constant hazard,

91
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,490
well if k equals 1.

92
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,470
And I'm calling k this power here, is
equal to 1, then if I plug in

93
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,700
k I get t raised to 0, so that t just goes
away and I get back to the constant.

94
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,620
So an exponential is actually just a
special case of a Weibull distribution.

95
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,430
Alright, so let me kind of just give you
some examples here for

96
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,670
Weibull hazard functions.

97
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,680
Here is, the Weibull hazard function when
k equals 1.

98
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,080
So this parameter k, what I'm calling k.

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,710
And again, you'll see it called different
things in literature, but

100
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,290
what I'm calling k is just a power.

101
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,920
I'm raising to a power in order to have a
way to

102
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,290
multiply something more every month.

103
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:45,144
If I set k equal to 1, I'm just going to
end up with and I'm using here a c of .1.

104
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:49,530
What we did before, that them or the
constant hazard is .1 and I'm

105
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,500
not multiplying by anything, every month,
just by 1, that I get a constant hazard.

106
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,710
That's actually just an exponential.

107
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,530
However, if I then set k equal to
something greater than 1,

108
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,030
I'm going to then have, be multiplying by
something that's above 1, and

109
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,950
whet you can see is that I get an
increasing hazard over time.

110
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,040
It's not linearly increasing, because
again, I'm raising by this power here, but

111
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,000
this is one instance of a Weibull
function,

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,990
I think I Set k to be 1.2 here, and C to
be 0.1.

113
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,480
Increasing hazard function, but

114
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,250
it's smooth, we can predict how that
hazard function is changing over time.

115
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,010
I could also make k less than 1, and when
I make k less than 1 I'm going to

116
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,880
get something that's decreasing, and they
look, the curves generally look something

117
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,120
like that, but again, depending on what k
and c are, this curve will change.

118
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,620
All right.

119
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,770
So then I took those, once I've
established those Hazard functions I

120
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,090
can then say how that translates to the
probability density function,

121
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,400
the cumulative density function, and

122
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,590
what we really care about here, which is
the survival function.

123
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,390
Again, don't get bogged down in the
formula.

124
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,720
The formula looks rather complex.

125
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,670
Remember that there's a mathematical
relationship between the Hazard function,

126
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,600
the pdf, the cdf and the survival.

127
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,060
I'm not going to make you do that
mathematical work.

128
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,050
I'll show you what the relationship is, at
a future module.

129
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,600
But don't worry too much what I wanted to
show you here is that if k is equal to

130
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,330
1 again, this just goes back down to the
exponential.

131
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,688
So if I plug in 1 and 1 here notice what I
get.

132
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:18,112
I get c, t raised to 0 which is just 1, e
raised

133
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:24,120
to negative ct so it just goes back down
to the the exponential.

134
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,150
I was calling the constant h for, before
for hazard ratio I'm calling it c here for

135
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,730
constant but otherwise don't worry too
much about that formula but

136
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,040
it's there just if you want it.

137
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,260
So now, I'm just showing you the
probability density functions as

138
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,510
a function of time, I have the same c, I
think I said c equal to .1 and all of

139
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:48,620
these, so they all have the same c, but k
is either 1, making this an exponential,

140
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,890
or greater than 1, making this, a positive
hazard over time, or less than 1.

141
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,010
So what you'll see is, that an exponential
curve,

142
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,840
as expected, looks like an exponential
when k is 1.

143
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,860
When k is greater than 1, you get this
probability density function, so,

144
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,270
there's a steep rise in your chances early
on in the having the event occur, but

145
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,380
then a lot of people by the end here have
had the event occur already, so

146
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,210
the probability of having it happen last
month is low just because moth

147
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,170
people have the even early on.

148
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,900
Because the hazard is high.

149
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,450
When we have case last in line the hazard
is decreasing over time.

150
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,900
So, you have allot of chance of having the
even early on because that's when

151
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,320
the hazard is highest.

152
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,750
And then that goes down over time.

153
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,320
The hazard rate is going down over time.

154
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,040
So, less and less a chance of having the
event in the later months.

155
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,580
So that's just what the probability
density functions look like.

156
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,780
The corresponding cumulative density
functions, again,

157
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,790
don't stress too much about the formula
here, but

158
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:45,230
I'll just show you that this does go
nicely to the formula for

159
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,650
an exponential if I plug in k is equal to
1 So you'll just end up with that and

160
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:55,550
again, I'm using c here when I used h
before but they're both just constants.

161
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,510
Just to show you a few different
cumulative density functions.

162
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,950
So they all have the same c.

163
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:06,430
The hazard is just staying the same here
on this left hand panel, so

164
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,190
we kind of have a shallow rise in the
events.

165
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,080
When the hazard rate is increasing over
time notice that the chance of

166
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,240
having your cumulative chance of events
goes up more, much more steeply.

167
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,060
You're getting, to you know, 86, 80% of
the sample,

168
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,300
having the event much earlier than when k
is equal to 1 as expected.

169
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,630
And of course if your k is less than 1,
then as the rate is decreasing over

170
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,885
time in the cumulative curve, it takes
much longer for events to accumulate.

171
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:36,330
[NOISE] And then finally, the Weibull
survival function.

172
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,860
This is just one minus the cdf.

173
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,990
So, again, the survival probabilities he,

174
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,190
are, these are similar to Kaplan-Meier
curves.

175
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,960
They're looking at survival function so
over time,

176
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,980
with the exponential, it's almost what
you'd kind of expect.

177
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,670
For an exponential, there's a steeper drop
in survival if you

178
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,170
have an increasing hazard.

179
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,580
There's a shallower drop in survival if
you have a decreasing hazard.

180
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,905
All of those again conceptually is what
you'd expect.

181
00:09:59,905 --> 00:10:03,550
[NOISE] And just to show you these kind of
all put together, so

182
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,980
if we have c is equal .1, the constant is
equal to .1, and k is equal to 1,

183
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,120
so the power, we're not raising to any
powers here.

184
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,580
We're on the exponential.

185
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,850
This is the hazard constant the
corresponding pdf which looks like

186
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,760
an exponential function, the cumulative
density and the survival probability.

187
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,224
Therefore we've got this increasing hazard
rate,

188
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:25,060
you know the hazard rates going up over
time so we have events very early on.

189
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,910
We accumulate events very early and

190
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,290
the survival curve is very steep drops
very quickly.

191
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,390
If we have a decreasing hazard over time
this ones decreasing over time then we

192
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:39,270
have event early then it drops off quite a
bit, from there it takes longer to

193
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,860
accumulate events because the hazard is
going down every month and

194
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,260
the survival probability, the curve
doesn't drop as quickly.

195
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,390
So that's the general idea of the Weibull
function.

196
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,430
And again, as I mentioned earlier,

197
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,700
hazard functions don't have to follow a
nice mathematical function,

198
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,890
you could end up with one with real data
that looks something funny like that.

199
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:04,290
At that point, we aren't going to try to
force it to be on a mathematical function.

200
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,400
We're instead, when we do cox regression,

201
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,104
just going to try to avoid estimating that
altogether.

202
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:09,664
