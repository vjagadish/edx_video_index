00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:23,637
Hi, I'm Larry Chu.

3
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:27,273
>> Hi, I'm Carla Guthrie.

4
00:00:27,273 --> 00:00:31,300
>> And in this segment, we're going to
learn about lines and

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,550
monitors, and what you need to know for
cardiac anesthesia.

6
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,940
So Carly, tell me a little bit about what
students can expect to learn from you and

7
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,630
your lecture in this modual.

8
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,630
>> So, what students should expect to
learn from this module is the indications

9
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,690
and the reasons why you should put in an
atrial line and a central line,

10
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,410
and we'll also go through some of the
basics of what is in a kit and how you can

11
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,980
expect to set that up so you're prepared
for your first day in cardiac anesthesia.

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,830
Wonderful.

13
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,050
Well you know, one of the things that
people really get experience with on

14
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,810
cardiac anesthesia is line placement, is
learning how to do those,

15
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,640
get a lot of experience in doing central
lines, in doing arterial lines.

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,830
So let's, let's dive in and watch a
lecture.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,070
>> Hi, my name is Carly Guthrie, and today
we're going to talk about arterial and

18
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,250
central lines.

19
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,490
First let's start by talking about
arterial lines.

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,710
Some of the indications for arterial line
placement include the need for

21
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,480
continuous direct blood pressure
monitoring, or, if your indirect blood

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,210
pressure monitoring fails, the need for
frequent arterial blood gas sampling, or

23
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,170
measurement of the blood glucose or
chemistries.

24
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,400
Let's talk about the arterial line
waveform, first of all any time

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,320
you're placing an arterial line; you
should place it under sterile conditions.

26
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,940
The waveform that you'll see once you
place the arterial line,

27
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,250
will show a high pressure,.

28
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,930
Which corresponds to the systolic pressure
as seen in the image to the right, and

29
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,380
the lowest pressure, which will correspond
to the diastolic pressure.

30
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,810
The main arterial pressure is a calculated
number, and

31
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,770
it's calculated by the equation MAP is
equal to two times the diastolic pressure.

32
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,000
Plus the systolic pressure divided by
three.

33
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,500
Additionally, you'll notice that the
waveform has a small dip or

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,710
the dicrotic notch or incisure which will
coincide with the aortic valve closure.

35
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,620
You can see that also in the image to the
right.

36
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,590
That about sums up arterial lines.

37
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,000
Now, let's talk about central lines.

38
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,390
Indications for central line placement
include any patient in which you

39
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,510
will need to use vasopressors.

40
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,069
Patients that may have difficult
peripheral access.

41
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,750
Measurement of the central venous
pressure, especially any time

42
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,890
you'll have hypovolemia or large fluid
shifts during a case.

43
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,270
Administration of TPN or

44
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,968
hemodialysis, and any time you'll need to
do frequent blood draws.

45
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:15,510
[BLANK_AUDIO]

46
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,470
Normal CVP values will be,

47
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,430
five to ten centimeters of water in a
spontaneously breathing patient, and

48
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,490
three to five centimeters of water higher
in a mechanically ventilated patient.

49
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,010
In a normal patient, we believe that the
CVP or

50
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,640
Central Venus Pressure closely corresponds
to the left,

51
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,540
atrial pressure, and therefore the left
ventricular and dystolic pressure.

52
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,000
However, this is true only in the absence
of right ventricular dysfuntion,

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,090
in the absence of abnormla pulmonary
resistance, and

54
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,990
in the abseonce of valvular disease.

55
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,590
Let's go through the CVP wave form.

56
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,050
First of all, the A wave corresponds to
the atrial contraction and diastole.

57
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,200
The C wave is due to isovolemic rate of
ventricular contraction,

58
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,970
when the tricuspid valve closes and bulges
back into the right atrium.

59
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,360
This occurs in early systole.

60
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,320
You'll notice that the C wave occurs after
the QRS on the EKG, and

61
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,250
the A wave occurs after the P wave.

62
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,910
The way is caused by filling of the atrium
with blood from the [UNKNOWN].

63
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,790
This happens while the [UNKNOWN] valve is
closed during late [UNKNOWN].

64
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,900
There are two descents.

65
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,160
Firstly, the X descent is caused by HR
relaxation.

66
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,570
Which causes a decline in atrial pressure
during ventricular contraction.

67
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,430
This occurs in mid-systole, so

68
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,240
you'll notice it occurs just before the T
wave on the EKG.

69
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,850
So y descent is caused by a decrease in
atrial pressure as the tricuspid valve

70
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,405
opens and blood begins flowing from the
right atrium into the right ventricle.

71
00:04:57,405 --> 00:05:00,670
[SOUND]

72
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,380
Some tips to remember when you're looking
at CVP Waveforms.

73
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,640
First of all, three of the waveform parts
are systolic events.

74
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,380
The c, the x, and the v.

75
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,710
Two of the waveform [SOUND] portions are
diastolic events.

76
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,239
This is the a wave and the y this time.

77
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,250
We use EKG to properly identify the parts
of waveform and

78
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,000
where they occur with reference to the
cardiac cycle.

79
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,530
Its terms systole and diastole always
refer to ventricular events.

80
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,525
Let's move on and talk about pulmonary
artery catheters.

81
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:37,660
[SOUND]
How many artery catheter's are Triple

82
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,590
lumen catheter's, which have a proximal
port for measuring the rate atrial

83
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,350
pressure, and distal port for measuring
the pulmonary artery pressure, and

84
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,390
the thermistor for calculating cardiac
output by thermodilution.

85
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,880
Some values that you can get directly from
your PAC line,

86
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,020
include the [UNKNOWN] caplet.

87
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,860
CVP, the right ventricle pressure,
pulmonary artery pressure, and

88
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,362
pulmonary capillary [UNKNOWN] pressure.

89
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:09,810
Also, you can get SVO2 and temperature
directly from your PA see line.

90
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,140
Indirect measurements, include cardiac
index,

91
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,450
the stroke find resistance, and the stroke
find.

92
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,310
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is used
to approximate left ventricular end

93
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,060
diastolic pressure.

94
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,870
Again, some normal values include a CVP of
zero to eight millimeters of mercury.

95
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,410
Right ventricular pressure of 15 to 30
over zero millimeters of mercury.

96
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,640
Pulmonary artery pressure 15 to 30 over
five to 15 millimeters of mercury.

97
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,650
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of five
to 15 millimeters of mercury.

98
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,390
Indications for pulmonary artery catheter
placement include: signficant left

99
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,220
ventricular or right ventricular
dysfunction.

100
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,810
Significant valvular heart disease,
pulmonary hypertension,

101
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,940
if you think you'll have a long operative
or bypass time, or a recent or current MI.

102
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,580
Again, let's go through the wave form that
you may see with pulmonary artery

103
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,420
catheter placement.

104
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:16,190
You can see the wave form to the image to
the right as you path, pass through.

105
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,550
First the right atrium, then the right
ventricle.

106
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,970
Pulmonary artery, and then, when you
finally wedge your catheter.

107
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,030
Typical depth of catheter insertion, from
the right IJ axis,

108
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,332
include the Right Atrium at 25-25 cm.

109
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:35,426
The Right Ventricle at 30-35 cm,

110
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:40,900
the Pulmonary Artery at 40-45 cm, and the
Wedge at 45 to 55 cm.

111
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,990
The corresponding Waveforms as you see
there,

112
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,410
the Right Atrium, and then you'll have a
large increase in your

113
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,920
systolic pressure when you go into the
Right Ventricle.

114
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,230
The Pulmonary Artery will then have a
increase in your diastolic pressure, and

115
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,769
then the Wedge pressure will have
decreases in pressure, as you can see.

116
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,130
That concludes our brief discussion of
central lines,

117
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,870
pulmonary artery catheters and arterial
lines.

118
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,770
Thank you very much for your attention.

119
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:16,120
Please feel free to see the corresponding
video about how to place them and

120
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,300
kit setups.

121
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,190
Thank you again very much.

122
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,450
Carlie, that was a great lecture, thank
you so much.

123
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:28,660
I do want to ask you, though, what if our
viewers out there really want to get more

124
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:34,020
of a sense of how this is actually done on
real patients, how lines are placed.

125
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,830
What can we do to help them?

126
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,340
>> Sure.
We thought of that.

127
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,360
So what we'd like you to

128
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,190
do now is go to the New England Journal of
Medicine's website.

129
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,170
An look for their examples on how to place
atrural and central lines, and

130
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,400
then you'll come back and talk more about
it.

131
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:47,900
>> Okay, great.

132
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,500
And we've put those links on the course
website so you can click through

133
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,470
those links now, and then when you're
finished viewing those videos, come back,

134
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,250
we're going to show you how kits look that
we use for placing lines.

135
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,400
So we'll see you in a little bit.
