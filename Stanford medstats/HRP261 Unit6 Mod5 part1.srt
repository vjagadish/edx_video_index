1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,370
In this next module I'm going to introduce
you to propensity scores.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,940
So propensity scores are another data
compression technique, but

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,680
it's a data compression technique
specifically for confounders.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,410
So we're going to be taking a whole big
set of confounders and trying

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,070
to compress it into a single number, a
probability called the propensity score.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,720
The primary use case for propensity scores
are observational treatment studies.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,350
So this is where there are multiple
possible treatment options for

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,410
a particular condition, but

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,700
they've never been compared head to head
in a randomized trial.

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,890
And perhaps that's just really a difficult
randomized trial to do and

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,220
they may never be compared in a randomized
trial.

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,250
So the best thing that we can do is to try
to

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,116
do some kind of observational study
comparing those two treatments.

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,880
The problem here is that there's going to
be a huge amount of confounding,

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,100
because doctors often have very specific
reasons about why they're

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,100
going to choose one treatment over another
for a particular patient.

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,430
And those reasons might also be related to
the outcomes.

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,370
So we have what's called confounding by
indication.

19
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,690
And propensity scores are trying to
address this type of confounding.

20
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,410
I'm going to be using two examples to
illustrate propensity scores, so

21
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,390
I'll just introduce them now.

22
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,900
So the first example is a retrospective
cohort study that was

23
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,630
comparing two treatments for aortic valve
replacements.

24
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,840
So there's something call the Ross
procedure, which is an autograph,

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,570
meaning that person's own tissue was used
for

26
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:40,490
the value replacement, versus a mechanical
value, with some anticoagulation therapy.

27
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,770
They wanted to know whether or

28
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,510
not one of these procedures is optimal in
terms of long-term survival,

29
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,220
that is not immediately after the surgery
but long-term.

30
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,420
Now, previous studies have actually
suggested that the Ross procedure might

31
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,800
have an advantage.

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,480
However, the patients that were getting
the Ross procedure were

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,820
quite different than the patients who were
getting the mechanical valve.

34
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,360
For whatever reasons, physicians tended to
recommend the Ross procedure for

35
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,880
people who were younger and who were in
better physical condition.

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,570
So that it's really hard to tease out.

37
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:15,110
Is it because the Ross Procedure actually
improved mortality or

38
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,700
is it just because those are the patients
that would have done well anyway?

39
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,910
So the propensity scores are going to try
to address that.

40
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,770
So you can see from table one of this
paper just how different these two groups

41
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,100
were, people who got the mechanical valve
verses people who got the Ross procedure.

42
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,880
So this was from, again, a retrospective
cohort study, so

43
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,960
they went back into medical records.

44
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,870
They found people who had had mechanical
valve, people who have had the Ross

45
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,070
procedure, and they were able to get data
on outcomes on death in this case.

46
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,200
But you can see that the mechanical valve
patients were

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,930
quite a bit older than the Ross patients,
almost a decade older, highly significant.

48
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,775
The mechanical value patients,

49
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:59,700
76% had calcification, strong
calcification in their arteries,

50
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,515
which is a lot versus only 36%, about half
as many in the Ross procedure.

51
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:07,360
36% of the mechanical valve patients had
had

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,580
a coronary bypass at the same time versus
only 4% of the Ross procedure patients.

53
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,400
So obviously, those getting the Ross
procedure are going to

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,040
have better outcomes in terms of
mortality, because they're younger,

55
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,400
because they're healthier.

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,020
Is there any additional advantage for the
Ross procedure?

57
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,990
Second example is looking at whether or
not patients with stroke who are in

58
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,840
a nursing home, whether or not they
benefit from rehabilitation.

59
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,010
And this was another retrospective cohort
study.

60
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,400
They were comparing patients who got
rehabilitation or, or who didn't.

61
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,130
The outcomes were community discharge,
that is getting out of the nursing home,

62
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,330
and just their functional status for these
stroke patients.

63
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,585
Now it turns out other studies have shown
that patients who receive rehabilitation,

64
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:51,054
indeed, do have better outcomes.

65
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:54,590
But you have to consider who gets
rehabilitation.

66
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,170
They tend, it tends for whatever reason
that people who

67
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,250
are less disabled actually are the ones
who are getting more rehabilitation.

68
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,760
They tend to be better insured for
probably obvious reasons.

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,440
They also tend to have more social
support.

70
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,930
So they're just healthier, better insured
to begin with.

71
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,820
How do we know it's the rehabilitation
that's improving their outcomes as

72
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,050
opposed to just the type of patient that's
selected for rehabilitation?

73
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,420
Propensity scores are going to help us
answer that question.

74
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,380
Now we could try to just adjust for
confounding by indication in

75
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,740
all the ways that I have told you about
how we can adjust for confounding.

76
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,370
So we adjust for

77
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,020
confounding by stratification, matching,
or statistical adjustment.

78
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,770
So you can imagine him saying, well, maybe
I can just adjust for

79
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,560
all these differences between the groups
with is some kind of, for

80
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,040
example, some kind of regression analysis.

81
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,960
There's obvious issues with all of these
in, in this particular case.

82
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,640
So there's many confounders here and
we're, stratification usually works

83
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,870
well if you're going to stratify on one
confounder, but

84
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,380
it's really going to be impossible to
stratify in a whole pile of confounders.

85
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,250
So we really can't use stratification
here.

86
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,640
Matching, we're going to run into the same
problem,

87
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,240
which variables are you going to match on?

88
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,360
If you try to match on to many it's going
to be really hard to find good matches, so

89
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,950
we cant really do that here.

90
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,820
We're essentially left with statistical
adjustment.

91
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,560
And statistical adjustment could work in
this case, we could just adjust for

92
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,120
all these differences between the groups.

93
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,860
But there's some potential problems.

94
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,010
It may turn out that some people in the
study, or

95
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,700
entire groups, are simply incomparable.

96
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,060
They're just too different to compare.

97
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,200
We can try to adjust for

98
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,540
the differences, but we, there's just no
way to actually adjust out for them.

99
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,907
We've talked about some of the limits of
statistical adjustment already.

100
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:34,680
There going to be a high chance of
residual confounding because of this.

101
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,770
And we just may run into this situation
where there be,

102
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,790
may be so many things that we want to
adjust for

103
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,340
that we may not have a big enough sample
size to handle that in our model.

104
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,472
So for the example of the Ross procedure
study, they wanted to adjust for

105
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,480
24 confounders.

106
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,360
There were actually only 36 deaths in that
study.

107
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,950
And when you're building models which have
a binary outcome,

108
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,970
you either have the event or you didn't,
you actually want to make sure that you

109
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:06,060
have enough events for every parameter
that you try to estimate in your model.

110
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,470
So if you have only 36 events, the general
recommendation would be that you

111
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,420
should only have three or four parameters
in your model and not 24.

112
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,750
So that's going to be a high chance of
overfitting if we try to put so

113
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,090
many confounders in the model when our
sample size is too small.

114
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,470
So there's all these limitations to
adjusting for confounding in this way.

115
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,660
With propensity scores, we can do well on
all of these.

116
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,920
So our propensity score is a single
number.

117
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,940
It's the probability that you would get
one treatment or the other.

118
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,290
So for the Ross study example it's
going to be the probability that

119
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,730
you would have been a person who would get
the Ross treatment.

120
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,710
And we can take those propensities towards
that single number and

121
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,260
we can stratify on them.

122
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,060
We can say, group people into quintiles of
propensity scores and then we

123
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,320
only compare people in the lowest quintile
to other people in the lowest quintile.

124
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,510
So now we can do stratification.

125
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,921
It's also now easy to match.

126
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:57,359
We can just match on that single number.

127
00:06:57,359 --> 00:07:01,324
For every Ross patient with a propensity
score of 0.7, we're going to try to

128
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:05,213
find a mechanical valve patient who also
has a propensity score of 0.7.

129
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:07,658
So it makes matching really easy.

130
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:10,405
We can also now more easily statistically
adjust,

131
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:14,559
because we can only have to put a single
number into our regression model, so

132
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,105
we don't worry about issues with sample
size.

133
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:19,852
Alright, here's the idea with propensity
scores.

134
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:21,393
Think about a randomized trial.

135
00:07:21,393 --> 00:07:25,221
The great thing about a randomized trial
is that all participants have the same

136
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:29,120
probability of receiving each of the
interventions in the trial.

137
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,660
That's not the case in observational
studies.

138
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,410
In observational studies some patients are
more likely to get the Ross procedure and

139
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,150
some people are much less likely to.

140
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,600
What we try to do with the propensity
scores is actually explicitly

141
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,130
estimate the probabilities, these
probabilities.

142
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,520
What is the probability that a particular
person has of getting the Ross procedure?

143
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,150
Propensity scores estimate these
probabilities.

144
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,520
And how do we do it?

145
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,050
Well, logistic regression,

146
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,950
because you can estimate predicted
probabilities with logistic regression.

147
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,520
We fit a logistic regression model with
all of a person's covariates,

148
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,570
all of the things that might be related to
whether or

149
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,160
not they get a certain treatment.

150
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,940
We put that into the logistic regression
model, out we get a predicted probability.

151
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,005
That's their probability of getting a
certain treatment.

152
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:16,190
Now everyone in our study,

153
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,040
of course, they've already gotten one
treatment or the other.

154
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,780
But this is theoretical, this is saying
that if this type of person went to

155
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,130
a physician, went to kind of any
physician, what's, what's the likelihood

156
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,230
that they would have come out with Ross
procedure versus a mechanical valve?

157
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,272
The propensity score,

158
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:36,720
again, is the probability of receiving a
given treatment given one's covariates.

159
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,870
We're estimating that with a logistic
regression model.

160
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,430
So what's the probability that this
patient would have got the Ross procedure,

161
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,788
given that they're young, they didn't have
coronary artery bypass, et cetera,

162
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:47,400
et cetera?

163
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,970
And, for example, when we do this logistic
regression the predictive probability for

164
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,290
a young patient who's in good physical
condition might end up to being 70%.

165
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,370
So that patient, whether or not they
actually did get the Ross procedure, they

166
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,210
theoretically have a 70% chance of getting
it, based on all these characteristics.

167
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,520
Now an older patient in poor physical
condition,

168
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,960
they might have had only a 30%
probability.

169
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,420
The idea here is that we’re going to to
try to find` people who have

170
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,280
equal probabilities and compare only those
people to one another, apples to apples.

171
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,240
Propensity scores are estimated using
logistic regression, so

172
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,950
we're literally going to fit a logistic
regression model.

173
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,310
We can model the probability of getting
the Ross procedure, for example.

174
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,930
And of course, if we don't get the Ross
procedure, you get the mechanical valve,

175
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,860
so this is just the binary outcome.

176
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,820
We can choose either one, but

177
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,900
let's say we choose to model the
probability of the Ross procedure.

178
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,920
If you don't get the Ross Procedure, then
you get the other one.

179
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,230
And you're just going to fit the the
logistic regression model with that as

180
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,240
the outcome and all of your potential
covariates, all the things that

181
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,070
might predict which procedure you get, as
your predictors in the model.

182
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,930
You get, out of logistic regression,

183
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,970
we've already talked about how to
calculate predicted probabilities.

184
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,300
We then apply a particular person's
covariates.

185
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,390
We put them in the model.

186
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,830
We get out a predicted probability for
that person.

187
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,650
The computer will do that for you.

188
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,250
You get a propensity score or a
probability for each person.

189
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,550
Now notice that we've taken a huge number
of covariates and

190
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,590
we've compressed them into one number, one
probability.

191
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,510
Now theoretically, we think,

192
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,440
the patients who have similar propensity
scores are somehow comparable.

193
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,550
So if it turns out that we end up with a
patient who has a 70% propensity score,

194
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,760
but they actually received the Ross
procedure, and then we have another

195
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,320
patient who also, based on all their
characteristics, had a 70 percent chance

196
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,110
of getting the Ross procedure, but they,
in fact, received a mechanical valve,

197
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,280
now we have a situation where these two
people are comparable.

198
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,830
They were both equally likely,

199
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,180
based on their characteristics, to get
this procedure.

200
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,320
One got the Ross procedure and one didn't.

201
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,960
It's as if we had randomized them at that
point.

202
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,680
In theory then, any difference in the
outcome would be attributed to

203
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,710
the treatment rather than to patient
selection.

204
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,460
Now just a quick note that all we are
requiring here is

205
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,480
that their propensity scores be equal, it
doesn't matter how they got there.

206
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,160
So somebody could have a high propensity
score because they were young; another

207
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,660
person could have a high propensity score
because they were healthy.

208
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,300
But as long as they're both equal, we
think that they have an equal chance and

209
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,150
that it's something like they were
randomly assigned at that point.

210
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,500
They each had a 70% chance.

211
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,520
We flipped the coin with a 70% chance of a
heads and

212
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,139
one got the procedure and one didn't.

213
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,460
So what the idea here is that we're then
going to match people,

214
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,540
one of the options is to match people, on
their propensity score.

215
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,550
So we take somebody who actually got the
ross procedure and

216
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,030
had a propensity of 0.7.

217
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:45,020
We match them to somebody who actually got
the mechanical valve procedure but

218
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,840
also had a propensity score of 0.7.

219
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,380
If we look at the match score, for
example, or

220
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,560
we could stratify and, and match people
within strata.

221
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,670
If we then look at the two treatment
groups after this matching or

222
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,390
stratification, what we'll see is that
they

223
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,990
will hopefully be balanced with respect to
all the covariates that we measured and

224
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,750
included in the logistic regression model.

225
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,200
Now, this is a little bit different than
what happens with randomization.

226
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,590
This is not as good as randomization.

227
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,770
This is like a poor man's randomization.

228
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:20,230
Randomization is much better because
randomization tells,

229
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,780
when you randomize that's going to yield
treatment groups that are balanced,

230
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,026
both with respect to measured confounder
and with unmeasured confounders.

231
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:31,940
That's because it's a random assignment,
so even if you don't know

232
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,310
about the confounders, theoretically those
are going to be balanced too.

233
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,190
Propensity scores,

234
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,490
on the other hand, don't balance anything
that you didn't measure.

235
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,560
So they don't eliminate unmeasured or

236
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,710
residual confounding in the same way that
randomization does.

237
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,390
So we'd always prefer randomization, if it
was possible.
