00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,080
Welcome to the first R module.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,390
In this video we'll be going over the
solutions to the first R exercise.

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,910
If you prefer,

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,880
there's also a written version of these
solutions on the class website.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,530
Now this first R exercise was really
designed to get you to

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,310
explore the different options in Deducer.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,390
So if you found yourself struggling a
little bit, don't worry.

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,900
It's going to get easier from here.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,720
The first step is actually not question
one.

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,790
The first thing we need to do is open up
Deducer.

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,544
So to do that I'm going to click this
shortcut.

12
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:42,150
[COUGH] And there are two windows here.

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,310
There's the console window on the left.

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,820
And the data viewer window on the right.

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,750
In order to open up my data, which is,
provided to you as an Excel file on

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,560
the class website, I'm going to click on
the open data icon

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,840
on the data viewer window on the
right-hand side of the The screen.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,740
This will allow you to navigate to
wherever you have that Excel file saved.

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,510
In my case it happens to be on the
desktop.

20
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,090
And I'm going to select it and open it.

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,880
Because our data is only on one worksheet,
the first one,

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,810
I'm just going to click okay here.

23
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,230
And I see that deducers was able

24
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,450
to load in the data correctly, I'm
going to scroll to the right.

25
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,840
Make sure everything's there, good.

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,380
I'm going to scroll down to make sure I
have 50 rows, great.

27
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,050
So at this point, we are now ready to
start the exercise.

28
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,200
The first question reads that,

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,420
varsity, the variable varsity is currently
stored as type double.

30
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,720
You want to change this continuous
variable to a categorical variable.

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,950
R denotes categorical variables as
factors.

32
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,880
The way we're going to do this is using
the data viewer window on

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,325
the right-hand side, I'm going to click on
Variable View here,

34
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:01,530
which will list all the variables in a
column.

35
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,865
Along with their type and something called
factor levels.

36
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:08,675
And so I'm going to go to varsity.

37
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:16,390
Click on Type, and then select Factor.

38
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,420
And notice when I do this that The factor
levels column gets populated for

39
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,170
that variable.

40
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,960
It shows two factor levels.

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,340
Level 0 and level one.

42
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,030
That's because varsity only has two values
in it.

43
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,740
I do want to caution you.

44
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,850
That when you're doing variable
conversions in Deducer,

45
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,170
like I did just now, that you don't go
back and forth too many times,

46
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,760
because Deducer will make assumptions
about what types of variables you want,

47
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,870
and what you want certain values to be.

48
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,090
So just be aware that Deducer makes
certain assumptions and

49
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,870
to always check your data.

50
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,190
After changing anything.

51
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,000
For question two we want to sort two
different variables.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,560
Varsity and writing love.

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,540
In different orders.

54
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,490
So first we want to sort varsity in
ascending order.

55
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,255
And then, eh, writing love in descending
order.

56
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,730
So the way I'm going to do that, I'm
going to click back to data view, for now.

58
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,620
The way I'm going to do this is by going
now to the console window on

59
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,429
the left hand side here.
