2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,360
In this next module, I'm going to review
the concepts of incidence rates and

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,300
rate ratios.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,390
So if you have time-to-event outcome data.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,450
The most basic statistic that you can
calculate is the incidence rate,

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,630
which just gives you the average rate of
events over the time period of the study.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,680
You can also compare incidence rates
between different groups

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,350
with something like a rate ratio.

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,660
Just as an example,

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,550
here's some data on 38 women who were
having trouble with fertility.

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,330
They were all given a treatment, and then
the researchers followed them for

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,510
about two years To see which women got
pregnant or did not.

13
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,998
Everybody got the same treatment so
there's really only one group here.

14
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:49,730
The left column here shows all the women
who got pregnant,

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,350
shows which month into the study they get,
got pregnant.

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,390
Remember, women can only get pregnant once
a month.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,800
So the unit of time here is months.

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,610
On, on the right hand column, these are
the women who are censored that is that

19
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,200
they did not conceive as long as they were
followed in the study.

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,480
To calculate the incidence rate here for
pregnancy then.

21
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,350
The denominator for the incidence rate is
the total person-years of follow up.

22
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,670
Or in this case, I'm going to use the
units of women-months of follow up,

23
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,640
because we are talking about every month
there being an opportunity for pregnancy.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,910
So the denominator here is just the
women-months of follow up.

25
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,460
How many months total did women contribute
to the study?

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,700
That is, before they got pregnant, or Or
up until the time that they were censored.

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,290
To calculate this is very simple,

28
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,300
we're just going to add up all of the
months that you see in this table.

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,736
So one plus one plus one plus one plus one
plus one,

30
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:47,810
because these first six women all got
pregnant in month one, so

31
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,660
they only contributed one month to the
study before getting pregnant.

32
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,790
So we add that up, we get six plus two
plus two, and so on.

33
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,780
We're just going to literally add these
two columns of numbers When I

34
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,910
do that addition,

35
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,460
I come out with that there were 240 women
months of followup in this study.

36
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,840
That's the denominator.

37
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,830
The numerator here is just going to be the
total number of events that occurred.

38
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,270
How many women got pregnant?

39
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,130
Well, we just say how many women are in
this first left hand column here?

40
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,500
There are 25 women who got pregnant out of
38.

41
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,930
So we had 25 pregnancies out of 240 women
months of

42
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,370
followup That turns out to be an average
pregnancy rate of about 10.4%.

43
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,150
So every month there was about a 10.4%
chance of getting pregnant.

44
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,610
That's just summarizing the little table
here.

45
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,740
Again, the denominator is the women.

46
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,560
Month of follow up there were 25
pregnancies I divide those to get that

47
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,880
the rate of pregnancy was about 10.4% per
month.

48
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,460
And we can convert that into a more whole
number it's a little bit easier.

49
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,090
For people to deal with whole numbers, so
oftentimes what we'll do is multiply by

50
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,520
say a hundred and talk about the events
per 100 women months for example.

51
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,910
So that just makes it a little bit easier
to understand, so if we were to

52
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:07,339
follow a hundred women for, one month, we
would expect about 10.4 pregnancies.

53
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,940
So that's the incidence rate for pregnancy
for that study.

54
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,810
Just another example to bring in an exam,
an example that has two groups so

55
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,570
we can compare groups.

56
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,990
These are data from a randomized trial.

57
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,280
They were 44 patients with chronic active
hepatitis.

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,770
They were randomized to receive a certain,
or to be in a control, and

59
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,330
not receive any treatment.

60
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,040
The outcome here was time to death.

61
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,690
The data represented a little bit
differently in this table, the left hand

62
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,320
column represents the treated group, there
were 22 in that group.

63
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,440
Everyone who is starred, that means that
they were censored, so

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,270
the last time we saw them they had not yet
died.

65
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,500
So, for example, this 56 represents
somebody who was in the study for

66
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,330
56 months, the units here are months,

67
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,840
56 months They were alive the last time we
saw, saw them.

68
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,570
But, for some reason they were lost to
follow-up.

69
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,160
So the ones that do not have a star
actually are, represent deaths.

70
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,030
We can calculate incidence rates for each
of these groups.

71
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,600
To do so

72
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,050
I'm simply going to add up the total
number of months in each of these columns.

73
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,110
So when I do that for the steroid group,

74
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:19,650
I get a value of 2410 months.

75
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,550
I then wanted to convert that to years, so
I just converted the months to years,

76
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,290
so that's 200.8 years of follow up,
person-years of follow-up.

77
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,580
In the control group, there were,

78
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,760
if we just add up the numbers in this
column, there were 1424 months.

79
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,370
Quite a bit less because, actually,

80
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,670
the control group, group died a lot more
quickly.

81
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:46,490
And if we convert that to years, that is
118.7 years of follow-up.

82
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,655
And then you can just count up the number
who died in each group.

83
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,945
Again, those are the ones that are not
starred years, so if you count them up in

84
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:57,900
the steroid group there were 11 deaths and
in the control group there were 16 deaths.

85
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,380
Just addition here.

86
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,370
We can then divide those to get incidence
rates in each groups, I've, I've

87
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,610
done that put the, all this information in
a chart and done the division here.

88
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,160
So 11 divided by 200.8 person-years of
follow up in the steroid group

89
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,650
gives us a rate of 0.055, this is in years
so

90
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,940
about 5.5 percent, of the people are
expected to die each year.

91
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,410
Again, it's nicer to kind of translate
that to a whole number so

92
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,640
we multipied by 100.

93
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,530
There were 5.5 deaths per 100 person years
in the steroid group.

94
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,360
In the control group, we divided the 16
deaths

95
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,260
by the 118.7 person years of follow up So
the rate was much higher, 13.5%,

96
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,080
of people were dying every year in the
control group.

97
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,100
So 13.5 events per 100 person years, a
much higher rate.

98
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,710
We can then formally compare those
incidence rates and

99
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,660
the simplest thing to do of course, is
just to say well the rates

100
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,310
are 13.5 events per 100 person years in
the control group.

101
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,980
Versus 5.5 in the steroid group.

102
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,140
We can just subtract those.

103
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,360
That's called an absolute rate difference.

104
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,430
And it turns out that we can say that
there are eight excess deaths

105
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,200
in the control group per 100 person-years.

106
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,010
Another way to say that is if we were to
treat 100 people with steroids,

107
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,340
we would prevent eight deaths per year,
per person year.

108
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,220
I should say.

109
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,640
And that's the absolute rate difference.

110
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,230
What's more commonly reported, however, is
people like to Make ratios of things,

111
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,550
as the relative risk, which is the, to
make a ratio of the two rates.

112
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,800
So, we could also divide the rate in the
control group by the rate in

113
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,920
the steroid group.

114
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,760
And then you would say that the rate ratio
is 2.45,

115
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,180
meaning there is about a 2.45 fold
increase in

116
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,100
the mortality rate in the control group
compared with the treated group.

117
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,320
Finally, just one last example.

118
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,980
This is That survival curve from 1669 that
I've already shown you.

119
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,880
Just out of curiosity, I wanted to figure
out,

120
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,460
well what's roughly the rate of death back
in 1669 for these data.

121
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,980
I don't have all of the data points.

122
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,120
I just have the curve.

123
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,140
So I did a rough estimation from the curve
kind of taking the,

124
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,140
the mid point, of the ranges that are
shown here.

125
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,900
I got that there was about maybe a total
of 1781,

126
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,610
Person years represented here you know
everybody died eventually so

127
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,500
there's a 100 events I started with a 100
people.

128
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,270
There's 100 deaths and they were alive in
cumulative total for

129
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,410
about 70 net 181 person years.

130
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,880
So we can calculate that the rate of death
was .05 Six per year so about your chances

131
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,150
of dying in any given year were about 5 to
6% which is really, really high.

132
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,620
The last thing I want to point out is this
module has talked about incidence rates

133
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,800
which I'm assuming that many of you are
already actually familiar with.

134
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,310
Again, the incidence rate just gives the
average rate

135
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,490
of the events over a given time period.

136
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,590
What we're going to be focusing on more
in,

137
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,980
in this class, is something called the
hazard rate.

138
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,430
So I want to just put in your mind right
now what the concept of

139
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,560
the hazard rate is.

140
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,440
It's very close to the incidence rate, But
it's an instantaneous incidence rate.

141
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,790
So the incidence rate is usually
calculated sort of,

142
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,510
sort of as an average over some time
period.

143
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,990
The hazard rate is what is your,

144
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,470
chances of having the event in any
particular time point.

145
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,490
And that acknowledges the fact that for
some types of things you don't

146
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,510
necessarily have the same chance of an
event happening at different time points.

147
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,760
The incidence rate can change over time.

148
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,410
And so we call that instantaneous
incidence rate the hazard rate, and that's

149
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,100
going to be a topic that we're going to
cover in a lot of detail in this course.

150
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,720
