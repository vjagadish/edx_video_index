1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,462
[BLANK_AUDIO].

2
00:00:07,462 --> 00:00:12,226
In this next scenario, we have an
emergency situation.

3
00:00:12,226 --> 00:00:14,459
Blood was needed for a patient.

4
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:17,627
The patient was bleeding out profusely and
the medical team was yelling out for

5
00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:18,180
more blood.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,182
When the multiple units of blood arrived,
one of the doctors started screaming at

7
00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:25,680
the staff about getting the blood hung
immediately.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,320
There was a shift change and the oncoming
nurse, who is,

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,820
just come on duty was given a unit of
blood and proceeded to hang the blood.

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,443
It was not until after the code situation
stabilized that the unit realized that

11
00:00:36,443 --> 00:00:41,070
the blood was provided was actually meant
for another patient.

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,540
So you may be able to picture a busy,
frantic situation.

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,140
Staff jumping in to help try to manage the
patient.

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,130
There's probably a fair amount of chaos
and pandemonium.

15
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,440
People are kind of hustling around,
screaming and yelling.

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,522
So what was identified in this particular
event as being the factors that led to

17
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:04,934
wrong blood being hung in this particular
patient?

18
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:08,674
Well, failure of use of two person
identification process, and

19
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:13,978
when it comes to high-risk medication and
blood product transfusion, there's a need

20
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,194
to have two separate individuals
independently doing an identification

21
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:23,900
verification process to make sure they got
the right product for the right patient.

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,880
And I know some of you would say, well,
this is the middle of a crisis situation.

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,472
Well, you might've been able to save the
patient at that moment by

24
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:34,932
keeping their blood volume up, but

25
00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:40,672
then subsequently that develop another
problem because a patient has a hemoatic,

26
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:45,610
hemolytic reaction because they have
received the wrong blood.

27
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,533
So, you know,

28
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:50,903
granted the question is always a balance
between safety and treatment.

29
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:56,223
And, you know, there's kind of a fine line
that probably in most organizations' case,

30
00:01:56,223 --> 00:01:59,233
they do it right, like 99.9% of the time,
but

31
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:02,523
that 0.1% time's enough to create a lot of
issues in

32
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:07,423
an organization where you have entities
like the federal government, the state,

33
00:02:07,423 --> 00:02:13,000
the Joint Commission, the plaintiff
attorneys, etcetera living with you.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,976
Another factor that was identified in this
particular event, fatigue issue.

35
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:22,696
Certainly distraction, production pressure
environmental issues,

36
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:27,340
space, lighting, noise variation of work
processes.

37
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,458
Those are things that, you know, in a
frantic, chaotic situation, especially if

38
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:35,228
you have shift change, you have people
trying to leave, people are coming on

39
00:02:35,228 --> 00:02:40,060
duty, you know, and they could create
hand-off issues, communication issues.

40
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,100
Staff training.

41
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,440
I know that most organizations, depending
on the kind of care service and

42
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,940
treatment they provide, would actually
have exercises or

43
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,840
drills to practice those once in a while
type of events.

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,680
But, nevertheless, you know, every event
has its unique variables and,

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,660
you know, the factors that lead to a bad
outcome could be slightly different.

46
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,910
Communication was certainly a factor.

47
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,250
Teamwork was a factor and certainly
culture.

48
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,750
Some of us know that in a frantic
situation, you know,

49
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,060
we're trying to get some response from
staff, do the right thing.

50
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,720
You know, sometimes the yelling and
screaming actually aggravates and

51
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,980
confuse the situation more, rather than
getting the job done.

52
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,742
So but hindsight after this particular
event, the review process you'd say,

53
00:03:24,742 --> 00:03:29,780
well, it's 20-20, it's crystal clear, we
know exactly what we did wrong.

54
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,364
And why we did it wrong, but in the moment
when these things occur,

55
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:36,948
which we've all been evolved with in terms
of medical emergency,

56
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:41,590
things are seen differently in the lens of
the different participant.

57
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,606
And ultimately, you know, you, you really
prefer that it do not cause harm or

58
00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:49,090
does not cause harm to your patients.

59
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,098
Some of the lessons learned from this
particular event,

60
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:57,612
Joint Commission's National Patient Safety
Goal require that two individual perform

61
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,170
a two patient identification check prior
to administering blood.

62
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,390
It doesn't distinguish between emergency,
urgent, or routine.

63
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:12,283
you, we all know in the case of a
emergency bleed out situation, you know,

64
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:15,450
fluid blood volume is super critical.

65
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,940
But even so, you still need to make sure
the double checks are put in place and

66
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,920
that they're followed through.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,510
Another thing,

68
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,469
the frantic nature of the case disrupted
communication between the team members.

69
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:31,220
There were certainly issues regarding the
hand-off, and the oncoming nurse, you

70
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,444
know, in this situation clearly thought
all the double checks were done and

71
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:39,998
all they were asked to do was to hang the
blood, not realizing that the double check

72
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:44,110
process hadn't been already done by the
team at the patient's bedside.

73
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,000
Another factor in term of lessons learned
is tight space limited the ability of

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,500
the team members to maneuver to perform
the double check.

75
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,090
They, in this particular situation, you
know, they had a wristband on the patient.

76
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,950
The armband is used as an identifier
because certainly, you know,

77
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,710
folks can't ask the patient.

78
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,890
The patient was non-responsive in terms of
their identification, so

79
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,964
they rely on the wristband and
unfortunately because of the really,

80
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:12,780
really tight space in this particular
clinical setting staff was wasn't able to

81
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,850
get to the wristband to do a verification.

82
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:21,310
So some of the prevention strategy and
this is really based on the culture

83
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:28,216
of safety, is that there needs to be an
understanding to push back when necessary.

84
00:05:28,216 --> 00:05:34,062
Staff probably would have benefited from
having someone pull the doctor aside that

85
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:40,066
was yelling at the staff to hang the blood
because I think, in the most cases, folks,

86
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:45,590
when they know what they're assigned task
are, they're going to go out and do it.

87
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,480
They don't need anybody else yelling and
screaming at them to do it faster.

88
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,630
They just need to be able to do it.

89
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,788
So there needs to be a culture of safety
with the team, to be able to push back

90
00:05:55,788 --> 00:06:00,820
when necessary, to make sure that, the
right thing is done for the patient.

91
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,946
Communication hand-off practices,
especially in the emergent situation.

92
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:11,348
I know many times, many of you folks, are
involved with code situation, and drills,

93
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:17,220
and exercise, and actually have real
drills real events, and real emergency.

94
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,400
That one of the big learnings from these
things is the debrief after the event,

95
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,610
to figure out, did we do it exactly the
way our system and processes had intended.

96
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,220
Or are there things that we need to do to
expedite things?

97
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,579
Or are there things that we need to do to
change things?

98
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:38,340
In this particular situation, there was a
need to do a repeat back instruction for

99
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,870
confirmation about the patient that we're
working with.

100
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,032
And if we had that in place, the staff
would have, you know,

101
00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:49,248
made aware that in fact that the blood
product that was available to the patient,

102
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:51,976
that the doctor was asking them to hang
emergently,

103
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:55,100
would have been confirmed to be not the
right patient.

104
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,857
And then there's another concept that
we'll mention that there's a fair

105
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:02,487
amount of research and literature on.

106
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:05,139
Has to do with team situational awareness.

107
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,850
We all know when the adrenaline gets going
you're going to hear what you want to

108
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,540
hear, or you're going to hear what you
think you need to hear, and that you know,

109
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,730
that when you communicate things,
everybody may not be on the same page.

110
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,925
This concept of situational awareness
plays out in,

111
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:28,469
certainly in the aviation biz, business,
commercial airline industry,

112
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:33,226
when somebody in the front of the
airplane, ideally the co-pilot, you know,

113
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:38,330
would say, hey, you know, to the pilot,
lights on, looks like gas low.

114
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,810
And if the pilot is focused on trying to
control the airplane because something

115
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,482
mechanically had failed, they may not hear
anything that the the co-pilot says, and

116
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:50,510
that has to do with the concept of
situation awareness.

117
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,873
So in the moment, in the situation, the
adrenaline is going,

118
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:57,010
there's multiple things being processed by
the individual.

119
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:02,390
You may not be aware or cognizant of
what's going on.

120
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,820
And you only may be aware of only your
particular slice.

121
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,910
And that's life.

122
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,742
What you feel may most important may not
be the most important thing for

123
00:08:09,742 --> 00:08:10,650
the rest of the team.

124
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,329
