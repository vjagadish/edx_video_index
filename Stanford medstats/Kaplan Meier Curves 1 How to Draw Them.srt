00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,530
Welcome students, this is a video K-M part
one How to draw Kaplan-Meier Curves,

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,709
K-M stands for Kaplan-Meier.

3
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:12,430
Of course, you're very unlikely to need to
draw Kaplan-Meier curves yourself, and

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,530
certainly software programs do this for
you given the data, but you need to know.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,160
How the data are actually converted into a
Kaplan-Meier curve intige,

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,280
in order to truly understand what a
Kaplan-Meier curve does so

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,190
we're going to take you through it I hope
your not too nervous the math won't be

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,090
too hard because we're only going to do a
very small clinical trial.

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,670
So, here's our clinical trial.

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,150
The clinical trial is a study in which we
are interested in survival after

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,550
surgery for pancreatic cancer and what
kind of survival are we talking about?

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,910
We're talking about overall survival.

13
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,220
We're, we're not going to ask why the
patient died.

14
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,630
We're only going to ask is the patient
alive or dead.

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,280
And we're going to measure it in time and
it just so

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,500
happens that our measurement in time will
be over the course of months,

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,440
because pancreatic cancer is a pretty
dismal tumor and lots of people die.

18
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,210
So here we go.

19
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:14,670
Now, what we're going to do is we're
going to start enrolling patients,

20
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,900
with the first surgery that I perform as a
surgeon.

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,520
But I dont operate on ten patients, all in
the same day.

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,580
The patients will get operated on in a
spaced out way and I may not be willing

23
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,310
to wait until every last patient has died
before I write my paper up because

24
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,780
I may have some interesting results that I
want to share before that point.

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,800
And in the case of some clinical trials
which,

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,840
in which you are going to measure survival
in say five years you don't and

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,000
you're accumulating the patients over a
five year interval,

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,650
you don't want to wait ten years before
you publish it.

29
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,160
Because if you started the trial on year 1
and you enrolled the patients for

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,150
the next five years,

31
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,710
you're going to have to wait at least 10
years before you can analyze it.

32
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:05,222
So Kaplan-Meier has a way of getting
around that and also it, as you'll see

33
00:02:05,222 --> 00:02:10,220
it's a way of dealing with incomplete
information in a very clever manner.

34
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,270
So here's our clinical trial.

35
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,700
We've got ten patients and the first

36
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,600
interval that we're interested in looking
at is the interval from 0 to 1 month.

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,460
And the reason were going to look at the
interval from zero to one

38
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:31,220
month is two patients happened to die at
the end of that interval.

39
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,460
So during that interval from zero to

40
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,239
one month no patients were censored, we'll
talk about censoring later.

41
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,040
And we did talk about it in class, but at
the end of the interval,

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,405
there were 10 patients left and there were
two deaths, okay?

43
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:58,570
So, at the very beginning of course,
Kaplan-Meier curve shows 100% survival.

44
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,120
At the end, two patients die so the curve
is going to come down a certain amount.

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,442
And one patient, one patient died,

46
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:14,533
from surgical complications, from surgery.

47
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:23,580
[NOISE] one died from complications of the
pancreatic cancer.

48
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,280
It does kill very quickly, okay.

49
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,190
And as a result, the curve will drop down.

50
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,240
Now, how much will the curve drop down?

51
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,370
Well at, at this point that we're talking
about,

52
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,360
there are 10 patients at risk, and 2 died.

53
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,216
So 2 out of 10 patients, died.

54
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:50,890
And the percent surviving, is 8 out of 10.

55
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,105
So, the percent surviving is 80%.

56
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:56,420
All right, good.

57
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,400
So, we've got 80% and now we follow that
out.

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,360
The next interval will be from one month
to four months.

59
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,690
Now, it turns out in that interval nobody
died.

60
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,990
The reason we pick one month to format
this because there was one death,

61
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,460
at the end of that interval.

62
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,240
But, several other things happened.

63
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,230
Now, at this point

64
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:29,070
at the two month mark, one patient showed
up to clinic.

65
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,000
At the two month part, but never came to
clinic again and

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,520
we don't know what happened to them, we
made phone calls and so on.

67
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,430
So that patient is lost to follow-up, lost
to follow-up, alright.

68
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,950
We can't say whether or

69
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:51,110
not that patient lived or died after two
months, our information is incomplete.

70
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,070
However, we do know that, that patient did
not die up to the two month mark and

71
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,110
that's valuable information.

72
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,818
So, we don't want to throw that patient
out.

73
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:07,543
[COUGH] In addition, we'll have another
patient here, okay.

74
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:11,914
Who entered the study three months ago.

75
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:12,940
Enrolled three months ago.

76
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,870
Okay, we're writing the paper now.

77
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,720
But we did the surgery, three months
before.

78
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,010
So that patient we know, survived after
three months.

79
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,330
But we're not really, willing to wait
linger, before something happens.

80
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,780
All we know is that patient still, at the
three month mark, was still alive.

81
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,181
We don't know anything after that and

82
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:48,220
you'll notice that at the beginning of the
study we had eight patients left, okay.

83
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,690
And four were censored one lost a follow
up, one that enrolled three months ago.

84
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,330
Another one that enrolled three and

85
00:05:54,330 --> 00:06:00,438
a half months ago and say another patient
lost a follow up, okay.

86
00:06:00,438 --> 00:06:03,150
Some censoring events.

87
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,660
Now of course less the follow up and so

88
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,620
on they tend to get lost to follow up as
you get further and

89
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,030
further out because say this one, this one
wasn't really lost to fall up.

90
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,080
This one may have, I mentioned very
quickly that this one

91
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,104
enrolled three and a half months ago.

92
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:32,396
This one moved to

93
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:37,340
England, okay?

94
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,700
This patient moved, she had pancreatic
cancer and

95
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,960
wanted to move to be closer to her family.

96
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:50,330
She had, she had children who had moved to
England and she wanted to move there too.

97
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:57,218
But because we saw her at this point but
never saw her again and really, she, she,

98
00:06:57,218 --> 00:07:01,060
she was in, no longer in any communication
and we don't know what happened to her.

99
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,010
She's also censored.

100
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:08,690
Now at this point, at the end of this
interval from one to four months.

101
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,380
There are four p, patients at risk, one
dies.

102
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:18,378
So, the survival at that point is three
out of four patients were still alive for

103
00:07:18,378 --> 00:07:21,570
75% survival at that interval.

104
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:28,147
So from this point down, we have to have
75% of 80%, or 60%.

105
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:31,630
So at that point, we have 60% survival.

106
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:37,604
And this patient right there,

107
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:44,740
one, died from pancreatic cancer.

108
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,960
All right and then we move out.

109
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,530
Now we have three patients left, okay?

110
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,440
We're going to have another patient who's
censored at this point.

111
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:57,820
One patient censored.

112
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,510
That patient entered the study six months
ago.

113
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,770
Enrolled six months ago.

114
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,770
Enrolled six months ago.

115
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,400
Okay, only followed for

116
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,920
six months and then we go out to eight
months and something else happened.

117
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,280
Okay, so at the end here at the end of six
months we have two patients left,

118
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,640
because we started out with three.

119
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,340
We, we have one, who was censored.

120
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,380
We ended up with two, two patients left
and then one patient dies.

121
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,390
And then the number of patients at risk is
two, one died, so that's

122
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:45,360
an overall survival for that interval,
survi, survival of that interval of 50%.

123
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,420
So we go from 60% down to 30%, okay?

124
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,750
And that patient,

125
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:02,570
that patient died in a car accident.

126
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,950
[NOISE] And you'll say,

127
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:14,050
wait a minute that's not very fair.

128
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,900
It looks like, it looks like it's
impacting survival after surgery.

129
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,310
But remember, we're only,

130
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,110
we've specified that we're going to look
at overall survival.

131
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:31,080
So, we have to, we have to just measure
whether patients are alive or

132
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,760
dead, and that's overall survival.

133
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,970
All we know, and all we know is that it
looks like a big effect because,

134
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,470
at that point, there were only two
patients at risk and

135
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,220
one died, happened to die in a car
accident, which is an unlikely event.

136
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,000
But there are many possible unlikely
events and if we

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,530
had a bigger study this wouldn't have much
of an impact, but we have a small study.

138
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,850
So at the end of that interval, we have
one patient left.

139
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,780
There's no censoring that goes on.

140
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,830
There's one patient at the end.

141
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,320
No deaths at the end and so, the last
patient's there and we're done.

142
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,090
So the overall survival that we have from
this

143
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:10,280
study is shown as a Kaplan-Meier curve,
okay.

144
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,190
Thank you very much.
