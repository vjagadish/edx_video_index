00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,600
Welcome to week five of the course.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,950
This week we're going to wrap up our
discussion of survival analysis.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,780
So, I've tried to keep the material in
this unit fairly light because you're

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,760
all working hard on your mid-term data
analysis and

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,200
there is no homework set specifically for
this unit.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,710
I'm going to cover a couple of topics, so
first of all, the idea of competing risks.

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,805
You've actually seen a data set that had
competing risks in it

9
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:34,895
already,so that melanoma data set that you
dealt with in the first couple of

10
00:00:34,895 --> 00:00:37,890
homework's actually had a competing risk.

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,580
There was variable that told you, did
somebody die of melanoma specifically, or

12
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,980
did they die of other courses.

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,030
For the purposes of those homework's, to
keep it simple,

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,090
we just want those together and we look at
overall mortality,but what if

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,410
you specifically wanted to look at risk
factors for death from melanoma.

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,450
How would you isolate that from death for
other causes.

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,400
This is the idea of competing risks and
it's a little bit tricky and

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,050
we'll see how to handle it this week.

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,800
Secondly, I'm going to talk about
something called the intention to

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,140
treat principle.

21
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,730
This is not specific to survival analysis,
but

22
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:16,820
is a principle that's used whenever you
have randomized clinical trial data,so,

23
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,300
because a lot of the times in randomized
trials we have survival data, we're often

24
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,550
implied applying this intention to treat
principle,so we'll go over that this week.

25
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,530
Just an introductory example along the
ideas of competing risks, what you're

26
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,170
looking at here are two Kaplan-Meier
curves from the same data set.

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,090
So on the left hand side you're seeing
cardiovascular mortality is

28
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,740
the outcome and on the right hand side
you're seeing deaths from other

29
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,919
causes that are not heart disease related.

30
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,690
What's interesting if you look carefully
at these Kaplanâ€“Meier curves,lets just,

31
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,620
for the purposes of illustration, focus on
just this low group the people in

32
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,850
this study were classified according to
levels of a particular blood biomarker.

33
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,580
Those in the low group, if you look
carefully and

34
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,570
see the total number that died of
cardiovascular disease.

35
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,420
You can kind of scroll over and you can
see that by the end of the study,

36
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,750
about seven or eight years in,there was
about a 50% survival probability which

37
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:22,520
means that there was a 50% chance of dying
from cardiovascular

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,960
heart disease related causes,so 50% chance
of dying from,

39
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,800
from that but, what's interesting is if
you go over here and

40
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,085
look at the low group, over again the
whole course of this study for

41
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:39,710
non-cardiovascular mortality, the survival
probabilities may be only 44 or 45%.

42
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,556
That means the chances of dying from other
causes besides CVD,

43
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:51,300
cardiovascular disease, was 55%,so

44
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,420
in other words, people in this study had a
50% chance of dying from heart disease,

45
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,280
and they had a 55% chance of dying from
things other than heart disease.

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,150
Well, we should be able to add those up
and

47
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,840
get the total probability of dying from,of
dying in this study.

48
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,110
Notice that if we add those up, it turns
out that people in the study had

49
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,885
a 105% chance of dying, and obviously
that's

50
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:19,560
impossible,so there's something wrong with
the way the data is presented here.

51
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,250
We'll get to this idea when we get to the
topic of competing risks.
