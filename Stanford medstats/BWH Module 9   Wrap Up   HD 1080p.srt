00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:26,577
>> Hi, I'm Dr Larry Chu.

3
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:27,922
>> Hi, I'm Dr Lauren Cornella.

4
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:29,275
>> And I'm Dr John Fox.

5
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:33,612
>> Well, in this segment, it's really our
chance to say goodbye to you,

6
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:35,006
as sad as that is.

7
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:37,884
I've had a fantastic time doing this
course.

8
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:39,083
I know.

10
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:58,877
>> Well, we know this course has provided
a very good introduction to

11
00:00:58,877 --> 00:01:00,800
the cardiac anesthesia pod.

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,900
I think that some last tips of advice
maybe would be to take everything you

13
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,800
can from this rotation.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,530
I think you're going to learn a ton.

15
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,390
I think you're going to really take care
of patients really well.

16
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,370
And you're going to learn a lot of
techniques and tips and

17
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,150
knowledge that's going to take you even in
your non-cardiac OR rotations.

18
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,395
I think something you're going to find
across the board about your rotation is

19
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:24,955
that everyone will be fair and happy to
teach you.

20
00:01:24,955 --> 00:01:29,465
Cardiac, anesthesia, tendings, fellows are
really looking forward to each you.

21
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,785
There's so much to learn and so I think
you're going to learn a lot.

22
00:01:31,785 --> 00:01:34,815
I think you'll also find that everyone
else in the room will be

23
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:36,655
really receptive to teaching you as well.

24
00:01:36,655 --> 00:01:39,285
I know that the [UNKNOWN] have really
tought me a lot,

25
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:41,780
the nurses know a lot of information, and
so

26
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,630
really try to get the most you can from
every single day and every single case.

27
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,730
And on behalf of everyone, we wish you
well.

28
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,650
We know you're going to love it.

29
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,060
>> Wonderful.

30
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,930
Well, again it's been a blast.

31
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,390
I can't wait to do this again,

32
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,000
maybe on a different a cardiac anesthesia
course in the future to come.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,770
Hopefully.

34
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,311
And we'll see you later.

35
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:04,911
Have fun in cardiac anesthesia rotation.
