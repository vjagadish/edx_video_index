00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,190
In this next module, I'm going to tell you
how we can use age as the time scale for

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,860
Cox regression, rather than time in the
study.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,030
So, up until now,

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,480
we've been using time in the study as the
time scale for Cox regression.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,840
So, what I mean by that, is when a person
joins the study, say subject one, joins

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,080
the study, the moment they join the study
a baseline, that's counted as time zero.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,790
And we start the clock ticking from there.

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,810
So, if that person has an event three
years into the study, that's their time.

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,100
Another person joins the study,

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,050
maybe a year later we count from the time
they joined the study.

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,280
That becomes their zero time point and so
on and so forth.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,700
That's the idea of time in this study.

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,251
However, there may be good reason to
instead choose age as your time scale.

15
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:57,033
And the main reason is that age is a
really important confounder in a lot of

16
00:00:57,033 --> 00:01:00,018
the things that we want to look at in
survival analysis.

17
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,670
So, for example, age is obviously strongly
related to death.

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,610
It's strongly related to a lot of the
diseases that we, we may want to look at.

19
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,721
It's such an important confounder that we
want to treat it specially.

20
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:16,803
Now, if we're using time in the study as
our time scale, we can control for age

21
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:22,760
simply by adding age as a co-variant, as a
predictor in our Cox regression model.

22
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,520
So, we can add in baseline age.

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,970
So, somebody who's 30 years old at that
start of the study,

24
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,940
is obviously younger than somebody who is
60 years old at the start of the study.

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,520
And we can factor that in by controlling
for it, adjusting for it.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,233
However, sometimes it's a better strategy
to actually choose age to

27
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:42,316
be the time scale.

28
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:46,210
When you choose age as the, as the time
scale, that means you're only going to be

29
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,535
comparing, 30 year olds to other 30 year
olds and 60 year olds to 60 years old.

30
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:53,902
So, somebody who has the event at age 60,

31
00:01:53,902 --> 00:01:58,925
their only going to be compared to people
who are at risk at age 60.

32
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:03,524
When you use age as the time scale, you
may additionally need to control for

33
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,750
both birth cohort effects.

34
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,790
Because, obviously, somebody who could be
in your study who, w, is 30 but

35
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,560
[INAUDIBLE] you know, was born in 1960.

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,037
And you could have somebody who is 30 in
your study, who was born in, 1980.

37
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:24,169
You could have both in your study if you
were covering a wide range of,

38
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:27,240
of ages in your study and you're following
people for a long time.

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,136
Since people who were born in 1950 might
be very different, have different risks

40
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:36,905
than people who are born in, say, 1980, we
can adjust for both cohort.

41
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:38,291
One easy way to adjust for

42
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:43,010
it is to simply stratify on birth cohort,
like stratify on, say, decade of birth.

43
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,610
So, how we actually use as a time-scale.

44
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,550
The idea is this.

45
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:53,310
The risk that becomes everyone who is at
risk at a certain age rather than

46
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,210
everyone who was at risk at a certain time
in the study.

47
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,860
The risk set contains everyone who was
still event-free at

48
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,480
the age of the person who had the event.

49
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,620
So, the 60 year old has the event in your
study,

50
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,860
they're going to be compared to other 60
year olds who were at risk at age 60.

51
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,560
Obviously, this is going to require having
a relatively large dataset where you've

52
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,190
got enough people aty different ages.

53
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,830
If you, if your sample is spread out over
many different ages and you only have

54
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,960
one 60 year old in your study and nobody
else crossed 60 during your study.

55
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,170
Obviously this is not going to work, so

56
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,770
you need to have a relatively large sample
that ha, covers al,

57
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,530
has enough people at each of the different
ages, covers enough different ages.

58
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,400
the, to understand age as a time-scale
it's best for

59
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,600
me just to kind of draw some pictures out
and also to go through the likelihood.

60
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,200
So, I'm going to use just a simple little
data set for

61
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,950
illustration, it's just a made up data
set, for the purposes of this module.

62
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,950
So, you see that data set here has five
people in them.

63
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,220
I'd call them ID numbers, one, two, three,
four and

64
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,390
five just to distinguish the subjects.

65
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,250
You can see that the, they have a time in
the study.

66
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,720
So, for example person number one was in
the study for let's call this years so.

67
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,780
For three years before they had the event.

68
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,920
Whatever that event might be.

69
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:09,210
They were 28 when they joined the study
and 31 when they had the event.

70
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:13,190
And that's going to be, I'm going to be
using age or time here as the time scale.

71
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,920
And I want to have one predictor of
interest.

72
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,210
So, let's say the predictor of interest
here is pack years of smoking it,

73
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,630
I have put that in the last column.

74
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,490
If we were to use time in the study as the
time scale,

75
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,300
as we've been doing, here's what that
would look like.

76
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,680
So, everybody starts at time 0,

77
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,294
the time they joined the study, and so let
me put the ID numbers here, one, two,

78
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:36,540
three, four, five, and let me just draw a
picture of what this looks like.

79
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,180
So, for example, person number one, ID
number one, was in the study for

80
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,160
three years.

81
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,000
This is time in the study.

82
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,580
So, they were in the study for three years
until they had the event, and

83
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,270
I'll designate having an event with an X.

84
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,670
The second person was in the study for
five years before they had an event.

85
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,960
The third person was in the study for
seven years before they were censored.

86
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,610
I'll designate the censoring with a little
c.

87
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:11,940
And the fourth person was in the study for
12 years before they had the event.

88
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,150
And then the final person was in the study
for 13 years before being censored.

89
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,800
So, time is start in the study, we count
time in this way.

90
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,145
What, how does that affect things?

91
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:22,460
Well that affects the likelihood?

92
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,040
So, let me just start to draw the
likelihood a little bit for you.

93
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,400
You think about things in terms of the
likelihood, it will all make sense.

94
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,350
So, we're going to be drawing out a lot
likelihoods in this module.

95
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,300
So, if we're thinking about the likelihood
remember there's going to be one term in

96
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,360
the likelihood for every event in the
study.

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,770
There were three events here so there will
be three terms in the likelihood.

98
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,310
The first event happens three years into
the study, so

99
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,710
we can draw a little line down to see who
was at risk three years into the study.

100
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,600
Well, all five people were at risk three
years into the study, so I know

101
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,310
the denominator for this first term in the
likelihood is going to contain everybody.

102
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,440
And let's say I've got B smoking in my
model, so

103
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,340
I'm modelling the log hazard is equal to
some, this is Cox regression,

104
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,210
so baseline has it that we're not going to
be able to estimate, plus a beta for

105
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,490
smoking plus I'm also going to adjust for
age.

106
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,390
I'm going to adjust for baseline age, so
I'll throw in a beta for age.

107
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,150
So, the likelihood here would equal, well
who's the person who had the event.

108
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,528
The person who had the event is ID number
one.

109
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:29,040
They were 28 at baseline, and they had one
pack-year of smoking.

110
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,250
So, in the numerator their hazard is
going to be the beta for age times 28,

111
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,910
their baseline age, plus the beta for
smoking which was one pack-years.

112
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,220
And then everybody else is at risk.

113
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,760
So, I'm going to put all the other hazards
in the denominator.

114
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,550
So, that person who had the event, just
like that.

115
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:56,680
The, the second person, subject ID number
two, was 25 at baseline and

116
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:03,873
their 30 pack-years of smoking we're
going to need more room here.

117
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:09,889
The third person was 40 at their baseline
age and they were 0 pack

118
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:16,766
a year of smoking, the next person was 29
at baseline, and was also a non-smoker.

119
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:25,025
And then the final person was 30, at
baseline and 10 pack years of smoking.

120
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:29,656
[BLANK_AUDIO]

121
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:31,462
So, that would be first term in the
likelihood and

122
00:07:31,462 --> 00:07:34,502
we could write out the other three terms,
I don't want to spend too much time on it.

123
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:37,841
I just want to show you what's going on
here is that everybody,

124
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:41,425
the first term in the likelihood is going
to include everybody.

125
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:45,200
The second term in the likelihood is
going to to include four people,

126
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,330
not including the one who already had the
event.

127
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,240
The last term in the likelihood will
happen here,

128
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,675
when there's two people left at risk.

129
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:54,800
There' s two who were still around at 12
years into the study.

130
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,750
We're going to make the likelihood a
function of the baseline age.

131
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,510
And in that way, we're adjusting for age.

132
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,290
And so that, you know, somebody who's
older, that's taken into account, or

133
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,400
somebody who is younger.

134
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,200
We also have a beta smoking in there.

135
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,050
We'll be estimating the beta for smoking.

136
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,740
And for the purposes of this example study
we're interested in the effect of smoking.

137
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,090
So that's the idea when we have, when we
want to look at time in the study.

138
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,880
Okay.

139
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,618
That's what we've been doing essentially
up until now.

140
00:08:20,618 --> 00:08:22,202
Now, switching over here,

141
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:25,240
what if we wanted to use age as the time
scale instead?

142
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,846
How is that going to look different?

143
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:29,603
So, let me draw the little picture here.

144
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:32,862
[BLANK_AUDIO]

145
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:36,168
So, when we use age as the time-scale
we're going to actually look at

146
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:39,160
a person's age rather than their time in
the study.

147
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,140
The ages here start at 25 so, I'll just
chart my age scale here at 25.

148
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:52,380
An excuse that this is not perfectly drawn
to scale and so person number one.

149
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,360
I'm going to put the pack years up here
cause that's going to help me to

150
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,510
remember when I'm writing the likelihood
of pack years for everybody.

151
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,370
So, person number one had one pack years
of smoking and they

152
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,920
joined the study at 28 years so that's
right about here, again, I apologize,

153
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,700
this isn't perfectly to scale, and they
were in the study until age 31,

154
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,630
and then had the event, so kind of a small
amount of time.

155
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,490
The second person was in the study from
ages 25, so let's say they had,

156
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,690
this person had 30 pack years of smoking,
they were in the study from age 25 until

157
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,940
age 30 and they have the event, again an x
designates the having the event here.

158
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,740
ID number three was at 0 pack years of
smoking.

159
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,670
They were in the study from ages 40 to 47
and

160
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,720
it was actually censored at the end of
that time period.

161
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,490
So, from age 40 to 47 and

162
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:43,010
they were censored and representing the
censored with a c here.

163
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:48,310
Notice that that person does not cross
over at all in ages with subject one or

164
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,200
subject two.

165
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,250
Therefore, they're never going to be in
the same term in the likelihood together.

166
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,760
ID number four was also a non-smoker.

167
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,640
They were in the study for a long time, so
from age 29 all the way up until age 41,

168
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,090
at which point they did have the event.

169
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:08,310
And then finally the fifth subject, who
had 10 pack-years of smoking,

170
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:15,210
was in the study from ages 30 all the way
up until age 43.

171
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,159
And they were centered at age 43.

172
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,950
So, now how would we actually write out
the likelihood for this little data set?

173
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,740
So, the likelihood here is going to be a
function of beta smoking.

174
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,480
Age is no longer going to be in the
likelihood because we're using age as

175
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,890
the time scale.

176
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,240
So, we're making the likelihood as a
function of beta smoking.

177
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,256
What's the first term in the likelihood
going to be?

178
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:40,798
Well, when does the, the first event
occur, so

179
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:44,892
remember the first event occurred three
years into the study for person one.

180
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:46,392
But if you use age as the time scale,

181
00:10:46,392 --> 00:10:48,770
notice they're not the first person to
have the event.

182
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,979
The first person to have the event is the
second subject number two who had

183
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,339
the event at age 30.

184
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:58,470
So, she actually or he had the event
first, and at age 30,

185
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,724
there were four people who are age 30
during the time course of this study.

186
00:11:03,724 --> 00:11:06,150
So, there's four people at risk at age 30.

187
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,300
The person who is in the study from 40 to
47 was not at risk at age 30.

188
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,270
So, what are we going to put into the
likelihood?

189
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,140
Well, the person who had the event is ID
number two,

190
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,280
subject number two, who had 30 pack years
of smoking.

191
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,670
So there, they go in the numerator, their
hazard goes in the numerator.

192
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,800
So, we're going to raise e, beta here is
beta smoking, e raised to beta times 30,

193
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,192
that's the hazard of having the event at
this time point, for the 30 year old, this

194
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:41,470
person who's 30 when he or she has the
event and has 30 pack years of smoking.

195
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,670
Now, I just realized that, that's well 30
pack years of smoking could mean she's

196
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:51,590
smoking 3 packs a day for 10 years and
then in the denominator, who is at risk?

197
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,270
So, ID subject number one is at risk,

198
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,750
they have a one, that person has one pack
year of smoking.

199
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,539
Obviously the one who had the event, the
30 pack year one is at risk, and

200
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:04,710
then subject number four is at risk, that
was a non-smoker, and then subject number

201
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,780
five was also at risk, that one had ten
pack years of smoking.

202
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,440
So, you notice right away that the
likelihood is different than what we

203
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,200
would use to time in the study as the time
scale.

204
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,840
What, when does the second event occur?

205
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,510
Well the second event occurs at age 31.

206
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,820
Subject one is age 31 when he or she has
the event.

207
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,980
There are three people at risk at that
time.

208
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,100
Subject two is already gone, they've
already had the event before he's 31,

209
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,010
and again subject three, is, doesn't join
the study until much later in, her life or

210
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,950
his life.

211
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:44,300
So the denominator here is going to be,
well the numerator first of all

212
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,370
is going to be the one who had the event,
that person has one pack year of smoking.

213
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,720
That person is also in the denominator.

214
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,220
Her or she is at risk.

215
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,450
Subject number four is also at risk,
that's a non-smoker.

216
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,630
And subject number five was also at risk
at that time.

217
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,660
So, that's the second term in the
likelihood.

218
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,720
The last event occurs at age 41.

219
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,440
That is in subject number four.

220
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,700
At that time there are also three people
at risk, because notice now subject number

221
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,140
three comes into play; because he or she
was in the study at age 41.

222
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:26,350
So, there are three people at risk at age
41, you have to squish this in here.

223
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,480
So, the person who had the event was a
non-smoker at age 41.

224
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,970
And then we had a, another non smoker at
risk.

225
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,110
So, the two non smokers at risk.

226
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,810
And that person who had ten pack years of
smoking.

227
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,980
So, there's three people at risk in the
risk set.

228
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,230
That would make up the entire likelihood,
for,

229
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,090
if you were using age as a time scale
here.

230
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,860
And then, of course, we would do maximum
likelihood estimation to solve for

231
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,890
the beta for smoking that made the most
sense.

232
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,940
But you can see that the likelihood comes
out differently meaning that

233
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,840
the beta coefficient is going to come out
differently for

234
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,740
smoking if we use age as the time scale
rather than time in the study.

235
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,520
And I went ahead and just wrote out that
likelihood again on a separate slide where

236
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,410
it's a little bit neater and I took a
little bit more room in writing it.

237
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,740
But that's just repeating what I did in
the last slide.

238
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,270
I've written out the entire likelihood for
you to see it written out.

239
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,450
I also want to show you that there are
slightly different ways that

240
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,470
you can model, that you can model age as
the time scale.

241
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,310
So, so

242
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:32,360
far we've been just choosing to look at
the ages in which a person was observed.

243
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,150
So, if we observe somebody from 28 to 31,
they are only at risk during those ages.

244
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,190
You could also start with time since
birth.

245
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,720
Their age since birth as the time stamp.

246
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,740
That makes a lot of sense if you're doing
a study on longevity obviously because if

247
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,630
a person joins your study at 28, we know
for sure that they didn't die before then.

248
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,740
So, there are cases where you'd rather use
the time since birth,

249
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,830
the age since birth as your time scale,
and then the people are at risk at

250
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,790
all ages up until the time that they had
the event or were censored.

251
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,650
So, let me just write up the corresponding
picture here,

252
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:12,960
and then I'll write out the likelihood, so
one, two, three, four, five subjects.

253
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,990
Here are the pack years, just so they're
handy when I'm writing out the likelihood.

254
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:22,840
So, the first person in the study, here's
the ages,

255
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,120
the first person in the study, subject
one, we know that they had the event,

256
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,640
let's say this, the outcome here is death.

257
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,420
They, they died at age 31.

258
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:41,320
So, they are at risk all the way, of
dying, all the way up until age 31.

259
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,720
Even though we only saw them from ages 28
to 31,

260
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,050
we're still going to count them at risk
all the way up until 31.

261
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:53,238
Subject two, if the outcome again here is
death, died at age 30, so, again,

262
00:15:53,238 --> 00:15:59,153
at risk from birth though, subject three
is, had, was censored all the,

263
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:04,012
at age 47, so that person is at risk all
the way up to age 47.

264
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:07,774
Subject four died at age 41.

265
00:16:07,774 --> 00:16:10,022
So, is at risk from birth until then.

266
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:16,250
And finally, subject five is censored at
age 43.

267
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,210
So, the picture looks like that.

268
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,670
The corresponding likelihood, it's
going to, again,

269
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,440
be a function of beta smoking.

270
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,180
Is now going to take everybody who's at
risk at a given age.

271
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,560
But there's going to be more people at
risk.

272
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,956
So, for example the event that happened at
age 30, subject two dying at age 30,

273
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:38,300
at that time everybody was at risk.

274
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,100
Everybody is now at risk at age 30.

275
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,820
So, the numerator is going to be E Raised
to beta three,

276
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,950
because that person at 30 pack years of
smoking.

277
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,930
That person is also in the denominator
there's their hazard.

278
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,050
He and everybody else is in that
denominator as well.

279
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,160
Everybody else is at risk.

280
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,310
So, if you're subject number one.

281
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,159
Here's, subject number three.

282
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,790
Here's subject number four, and here is
subject number five.

283
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,868
Everyone was at risk at that first event
time at age 30.

284
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:09,836
At age 31,

285
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:15,883
everybody is at risk except subject number
two who already died before age 31.

286
00:17:15,883 --> 00:17:21,081
So, the likelihood would be the person who
died had one

287
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:27,183
pack year of smoking, so that's subject
one, this represents

288
00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:32,976
subject three this is subject four and
this is subject five.

289
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:37,595
And finally the last event occurs when
there are still three people at risk.

290
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:42,013
Three people who crossed over age 41 and
that person,

291
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:47,465
the person who died was a non-smoker
that's subject number four but

292
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:52,583
also at risk was subject number three and
subject number five.

293
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:56,949
So, you can again see that the likelihood
looks slightly different if

294
00:17:56,949 --> 00:18:00,096
we count the time since birth as the
time-scale.

295
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:03,736
You're going to be writing a lot of
likelihoods out this week and

296
00:18:03,736 --> 00:18:06,780
so hopefully you'll get the hang of these.

297
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,320
Again, by looking at the likelihood,

298
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,979
you can really see what's going on in
terms of the model.

299
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,160
Just to give a quick example.

300
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,980
We've already seen an example where the
age was used as the time scale rather than

301
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,020
the time in the study and this was, they
used the age since birth.

302
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,590
This was the study looking at Academy
Award winners versus nominees.

303
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,350
They looked at actors and actresses.

304
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,210
As well as screen writers, I'm showing you
the Kaplan-Meier curve for

305
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,660
the screen writers here.

306
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,650
So, again in red, for screen writers, the
winners actually did worse than those

307
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:41,810
were only ever nominated, but you can see
on the Kaplan-Meier curve that the time

308
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,180
scale here is age and we start counting
from birth.

309
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:50,295
So, people are counted as at risk all the
way up through all of their ages,

310
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,581
and when somebody has an event, when
somebody dies here,

311
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:59,500
your counting a 50 year old; who might've
been born in the you know, 1920s.

312
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:05,270
We might be counting them against a 50
year old who was born in the 1940s,

313
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,930
in terms of the risk set, it's everybody
who has gone through the age 50 here.

314
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,090
And so this actually used age at the time
scale in

315
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,580
the Kaplan-Meier's here as well as in
their Cox regression.

316
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,980
So, this is an example of the use of age
as the time scale.
