1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,868
This first question is asking about the
primary benefit of randomization, and

2
00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:06,695
the answer here is c.

3
00:00:06,695 --> 00:00:11,660
Randomization is beneficial because it
minimizes confounding.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,164
Okay.
It doesn't improve patient

5
00:00:13,164 --> 00:00:14,457
recruitment really.

6
00:00:14,457 --> 00:00:16,109
In fact, it might detract from it,

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,477
because patients have to agree to be
randomized to either arm in the study.

8
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:27,069
It doesn't reduce costs really, and it
doesn't serve to prevent recall bias.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,308
The primary point of randomization is to
ensure that

10
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:36,470
confounders are balanced between the
different arms of a study.

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,794
This second question is asking about a key
benefit of

12
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:46,510
cohort studies both prospective and
retrospective.

13
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,780
The key advantage in cohort studies is
that the risk factors are measured before

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,880
you know the outcome, okay, and that's in
contrast to case control studies.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,912
You recall that in case control studies
one of the weaknesses is

16
00:01:00,912 --> 00:01:05,232
recall bias that is a differential memory
of exposures based on,

17
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:11,450
what group you are in whether you are a
case or a control.

18
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,423
Cohort studies don't avoid confounding.

19
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:18,669
They usually last longer than randomized
trials.

20
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:23,483
Especially prospective ones prospective
cohort studies and

21
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:29,715
they may involve loss to followup because
of this reason.

22
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:34,298
Primarily they take so long to occur.

23
00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:37,142
So really the answer here is that

24
00:01:37,142 --> 00:01:42,520
risk factors are measured before the
outcome has occurred.

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,479
The absolute, absolute key benefit of a
case

26
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:54,212
control study is that they allow us to
study very rare diseases.

27
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:57,551
You can imagine that if you're designing a
cohort study for this answer, and

28
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:00,678
you know that it's a rare disease, you're
going to need a massive number of

29
00:02:00,678 --> 00:02:06,890
people enrolled in your study to generate
a few outcomes, just because it's rare.

30
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,821
Right?
With a case control study you can

31
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:11,390
basically cherry-pick your cases.

32
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,380
You can select the diseases.

33
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,652
And then match those patients on specific
controls.

34
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:20,956
That you define in your study design and
so,

35
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:25,436
that's really the key distinguishing
benefit between case control studies and

36
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:30,547
cohort studies and really other, other
study designs.

37
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:35,563
So, in this question we are presented with
a situation where 1,000 women

38
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:43,390
are enrolled for half a year and ten women
in that cohort developed breast cancer.

39
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,710
The question is asking us what the
incidence rate for that breast cancer was.

40
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,940
So first, what we want to do is calculate
the appropriate years of follow up.

41
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,540
And so what that's going to be is we're
going to multiply 1.000 times 0.5, okay.

42
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,119
So that's going to be 500 years of
follow-up.

43
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:08,572
And then we have, over that time, we have
10 cases,

44
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:15,672
so that's 10 over 500 which is equal to 1.

45
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:25,479
Over 50 or 2 eventers per 100 woman years.

46
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,760
Okay, so the answer in this case is going
to be d.

47
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,960
So in this question, we're presented with
a similar situation 1000

48
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,460
women are followed for half a year, 10
develop breast cancer.

49
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,200
This question's asking for the cumulative
risk of breast cancer.

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,860
So what we're going to do here is make
this a fraction.

51
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,655
So you have 10 cases over 1,000 women.

52
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:58,680
So the cumulative risk in this cohort is
1%, it's b.

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,929
So what's important to note here is that
cumulative risk does not

54
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:07,289
take time into account which is why we can
perform this calculation like we did.

55
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,053
The correct answer in this case is c.

56
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:19,160
The prevalence is the sort of measure of
the [INAUDIBLE] frequency.

57
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,460
I guess that can be calculated from a
cross section of studies.

58
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,198
You can't calculate the incidence rate,
you can calculate the cumulative risk.

59
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:31,502
But you can calculate the prevalence from
cross sectional designs and

60
00:04:31,502 --> 00:04:34,991
they're often actually used, for that
purpose.

61
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:39,471
In case control studies, you can not
calculate disease frequency,

62
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:45,210
because you don't know the greater picture
of the population.

63
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,627
Because we're only selecting a certain
number of cases out of

64
00:04:48,627 --> 00:04:51,560
an unknown amount of cases.

65
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,150
We do not know the disease frequency.

66
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,092
The answer to this question is true.

67
00:04:58,092 --> 00:05:02,636
When it's possible to calculate both the
rate difference and the risk difference

68
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:08,288
the rate difference is preferred because
it's a more precise measure.

69
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:11,820
This statement is false, it's a little bit
tricky.

70
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,175
So the number needed to treat or harm is
actually the reciprocal of

71
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:20,270
the difference in disease rates, not the
difference in disease risks.

72
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,320
This statement is true.

73
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,972
One cannot calculate risk difference, rate
differences, or

74
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:30,075
the number needed to treat, or harm from a
case control study, right?

75
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:34,202
And so the case, in a case control study,
the researcher picks the cases.

76
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:40,886
And so you do not know anything about the
frequency of cases.

77
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:46,730
Because the, your study isn't reflective
of the general population.

78
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,386
The answer to this question is c.

79
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:51,510
Rate ratios and risk ratios are not always
equal.

80
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,210
So the reason for this is that risk ratios
could differ if

81
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:01,400
the groups being compared were followed
for differing amounts of time.

82
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,130
This is rare but it does happen.

83
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,200
If disease rates are identical in two
groups the cumulative risks will

84
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,904
differ if one group is followed for
longer.

85
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:18,139
But again, that's sort of a rare situation
in reality when that happens.

86
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:22,092
This question asks what are the odds that
correspond to a risk of 60% so,

87
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:24,973
if you remembered what the definition of
an odds is,

88
00:06:24,973 --> 00:06:30,700
it's simply the probability over one minus
the probability.

89
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:36,344
So, if the risk or the probability is 60%,
that's going to be 60% over one minus 40%,

90
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:41,715
and that is going to be equal to b, 3 over
2.

91
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:44,718
So this question presents us a situation
40% of

92
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:51,000
our treated group has a positive response
versus just 10% placebo group.

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,210
What is the risk ration and odds ratio?

94
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,913
The risk ratio is the more straight
forward one to calculate,

95
00:06:56,913 --> 00:07:00,146
here it's giving us a probability of 40%
having a positive response to

96
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:05,705
the treat group versus a probability of
10% here, so that is going to be 4.

97
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:12,630
The odds ratio, right, if you remember the
odds is defined as p over 1 minus p.

98
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,099
So that's going to be let's say 40% over
60%, so

99
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:26,210
100% minus 40% divided by 10% over 90%,
that is going to give us 6.

100
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,940
So the answer here is b.

101
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,020
The next question is asking us,

102
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,130
which of the following is not a measure of
relative risk?

103
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,300
And the answer here is d, number needed to
treat.

104
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,562
Everything else is a ratio.

105
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:45,540
Okay, so everything else is a measure of
relative risk.

106
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,440
It's a relative risk against some
reference group.

107
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,119
And so, the answer here is d,

108
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:56,128
number needed to treat is not a measure of
any relative risk.

109
00:07:56,128 --> 00:08:01,090
So this question's a bit tricky so let's
talk it through.

110
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,470
So, in a cross-sectional study about sleep
quality and duration and

111
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:12,480
hypertension, researchers found that about
25% of normal sleepers had hypertension.

112
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,666
They also found that insomniacs were
significantly more likely to

113
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,260
have hypertension than normal sleepers.

114
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,125
The odds ratio for this association was
5.12.

115
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,150
It's asking us to pick the correct
statement.

116
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,122
So the correct statement here is c,

117
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:32,814
insomniacs with short duration have a
5-fold higher odds of having hypertension,

118
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:37,810
which corresponds to a 2 and a half fold
higher risk.

119
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:42,210
And the calculation for that will be shown
one your screen.

120
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:48,250
So that's RR for relative risk equals
5.12.

121
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:54,322
That's the odds ratio times 1 minus 0.25.

122
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:59,546
ta, plus 0.25 times 5.12 times 5.12 right,
is the odds ratio.

123
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:04,387
0.25 represents the probability in the
reference group

124
00:09:04,387 --> 00:09:08,713
that's given in the question stem when it
says that

125
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:17,270
researchers Found about 25% of normal
sleepers had hypertension.

126
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:24,993
So, using this formula, we can calculate
that the relative risk is about 2.5.

127
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:33,100
You can rule out option d, because of this
and you can rule out A and B.

128
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,642
Because odds ratios give relative changes
in odds and not risk.

129
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:42,464
So, in this situation, we're presented
with a situation in

130
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:46,208
which the rate of premenopausal breast
cancer is about 30

131
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:54,020
out of 100,000 women per year in those who
have never used oral contraceptives.

132
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,388
One study estimated that the relative risk
of breast cancer for

133
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:03,503
users versus non-users is 1, is
approximately 1.2.

134
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:07,760
What is the corresponding absolute rate
difference?

135
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,470
So, the first thing we want to do is
calculate the absolute rate in

136
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,170
oral contraceptive users.

137
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:19,742
Okay and the way I'm going to do that is
I'm going to take 30 out of 100,000.

138
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,560
And multiply that by 1.19, which is the
relative risk.

139
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,850
Okay.
So I'm taking the rate of

140
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,550
premenopausal breast cancer in those who
have never used oral contraceptives.

141
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,670
Multiplying that by the relative risk, to
get the risk for

142
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,650
women who use oral contraceptives.

143
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:44,146
So that's going to give me about

144
00:10:44,146 --> 00:10:53,920
36 cases per 100,000 women years.

145
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,612
Okay.
So then the absolute rate difference is

146
00:10:57,612 --> 00:10:59,796
going to be 36 minus 30, so

147
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:07,440
about 6 cases per 100,000 years, and that
corresponds to c.

148
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,360
So, in this question, we're presented with
the same scenario.

149
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,080
We have a a rate.

150
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,842
So, 30 out of 100,000 woman per year for
developing breast cancer and

151
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:25,050
those women who've never used oral
contraceptives.

152
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,329
And we're also given a relative risk like
before but

153
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,200
this time we're asked to calculate the
number needed to harm.

154
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,690
So in order to do that, we're going to use
a result from the previous question.

155
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,112
So if you remember all we did was multiply
1.19 with this rate to get the absolute

156
00:11:40,112 --> 00:11:47,170
rate of premenopausal breast cancer and
those who have used oral contraceptives.

157
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:52,186
So that was worked out to be 36 cases per
1000 women, I'm sorry 100,000 women, and

158
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:55,150
then the absolute rate difference is 36

159
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:01,600
cases per 100,000 women minus 30 cases per
100,000 women.

160
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,456
So the absolute difference was worked

161
00:12:07,456 --> 00:12:15,173
out to be 6 cases per 100,000 women.

162
00:12:15,173 --> 00:12:16,018
[COUGH] And so,

163
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:20,972
the number needed to harm is simply the
reciprocal Of this relationship.

164
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:21,910
Okay.

165
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,995
So the reciprocal of this.

166
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:30,940
So the number needed to harm can be
calculated

167
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:40,558
by dividing 100,000 over 6, to give us
16.667 or 16,667.

168
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:44,429
16,667 rather, and so our answer here is
b.
