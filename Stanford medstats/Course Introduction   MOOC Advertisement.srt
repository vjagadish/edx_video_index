Hi, I'm Doctor Larry Chu.

3
00:00:17,432 --> 00:00:19,750
>> Hi, I'm Doctor Kevin Jenner.

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,910
>> On behalf of the Stanford AIM Lab, I'd
like to tell you about an exciting new

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,910
course that we've developed in partnership
with the Medical College of Wisconsin.

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,110
Looking at the essentials of geriatric
anesthesia.

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,600
Really, an online course designed to give
an overview of some of

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,475
the essential issues associated with the
preoperative care of the new patients.

9
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:44,830
Now Kevin, tell me a little bit about why
someone want to

10
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,000
take a course about pediatric, about
geriatric anesthesia.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,970
>> Well, geriatric anesthesia is becoming
ever more important in

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,910
the anesthesiologist's tool, toolbox.

13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,200
And knowing the principles and concepts
around that, that govern the way in

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,240
which geriatric patients are different
from other patients is very important.

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,440
The American population is ageing, as our
populations all around the world, and

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,410
there are more patients who are living
longer and requiring surgical procedures

17
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,510
further into their into their geriatric
years than they were decades ago.

18
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,570
So, it's important to understand these
issues and be competent and confident when

19
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,400
caring for geriatric patients, so that we
can do that safely in the operating room.

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,620
>> And of course, these days, there are
just more surgical procedures available

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,540
that elderly patients are taking part of.

22
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,920
And that's really increasing the,

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,190
the number of anesthetics being provided
to elderly patients.

24
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,315
And, and we're going to talk about some of
those important issue in

25
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:38,290
preoperative care.

26
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,920
Including the physiology and

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,880
pharmacology relevant to changes as your
body ages and how we provide anesthesia.

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,110
We're going to talk also about ethics and
the important ethical issues

29
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,560
that can sometimes arise in patients who
are elderly.

30
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,610
And of course, post-operative issues like
cognitive dysfunction and

31
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,020
delirium are important, I think, for any
anesthesiologist to know about.

32
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,745
So we hope that you

33
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:15,234
will join us for this

34
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:21,724
online course, and

35
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:27,450
we look forward to

36
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:33,193
seeing you soon.
