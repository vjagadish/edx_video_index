00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,100
In this next module,

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,800
I'm going to do a demo edit of a student's
essay from a previous course.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,698
This will give you a chance to see how I
approach editing an entire essay.

5
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:17,220
[BLANK_AUDIO]

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,120
Now take a minute, pause the video, read
through this essay once or twice.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,540
I've also provided the essay as a separate
text file, so

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,940
you can read through it there as well.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,380
And if you have time it'd be even a great
exercise to try to edit it on

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,062
your own before you restart the video and
watch me walk you through it.

11
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:38,206
[BLANK_AUDIO]

12
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:42,124
This essay is on a biological topic.

13
00:00:42,124 --> 00:00:43,817
It has a lot of nice features to it, so

14
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:47,427
one of the good things about this essay,
one thing the author has done really,

15
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:50,730
really nicely, is it's very clear what the
main point of the paper is.

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,690
And, in fact, there's a nice sentence
right at the end of

17
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,690
the first paragraph that says exactly what
the main point of this essay is.

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,450
In a landmark study, published in the
journal Plant Cell, Tanaka and

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,350
colleagues recently uncovered and

20
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,850
additional role for reactive oxygen
species as regulators of symbiosis.

21
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,420
So right in there in a nutshell, we get
exactly what this piece is about.

22
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,640
And the author does a great job of
sticking to that theme.

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,800
The essay is also really well organized.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,180
The flow is very good, it follows along
very logically, so

25
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,623
you'll see as I'm editing this, I'm
actually not going to reor,

26
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:27,570
arrange any sentences or paragraphs as I
often will have to do in an edit.

27
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,300
The main thing that I'm going to focus on,

28
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,960
in this essay is just streamlining,
trimming a few words,

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,660
a few technical things here and there,
maybe changing a few nouns into verbs, and

30
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,510
that kind of thing that we've been talking
about in this course.

31
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,410
So starting with the first paragraph,
that's a great first sentence,

32
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,580
I'm actually going to leave it exactly as
it is.

33
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,540
Reactive oxygen species are highly
reactive chemicals often associated with

34
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,150
escalating warfare between pathogens and
their hosts.

35
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,420
So we get this picture right off the bat
of the reactive oxygen species as

36
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,010
a bad player.

37
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,090
And I think most readers will be familiar
with reactive oxygen

38
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,190
species because they're being talked about
pretty widely even in,

39
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,140
in popular media these days, and everybody
kind of knows they're bad players.

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,170
The next sentence gives some examples of
the use of ROS in biological defenses.

41
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,550
This sentence it just has a slight awkward
thing at the very end,

42
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,850
the to ward off of microbial infections
doesn't flow perfectly nicely here.

43
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,740
So this is a good example where a couple
of dashes might help us out.

44
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,530
So I'm just going to set off the examples
of

45
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,210
the biological defenses here with dashes.

46
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:38,080
That will just make it flow just a little
more smoothly here, and

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,600
then we have to change the to ward off, to
that ward off,

48
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,500
so we get that ROS are integral to
biological defenses.

49
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,588
Such as, here's a couple of examples, that
ward off microbial infections and

50
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:52,580
then, I'm going to change infections to
invaders just to

51
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,620
go along with this theme of the warfare
here.

52
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,090
It's a little bit, more exciting than
infections.

53
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,041
I'm going to make one small tweak to that
last sentence.

54
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,291
In a landmark study, published to the
journal Plant Cell,

55
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,941
I'm going to add the in 2006 here and take
out the word recently.

56
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:11,808
Mm, technically 2006 isn't totally recent,
so

57
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:14,440
I think it'd be better just to give the
date here.

58
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,890
So, the first paragraph works really well.

59
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,360
They get the point across.

60
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,121
It's nice, good, vivid language there.

61
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,579
The next paragraph gives the background
for

62
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:29,905
the Tanaka experiment, and I think again
it's really well organized.

63
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:31,710
It's the right thing to come next.

64
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,986
The only thing I'm going to do in this
paragraph is just to

65
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:36,838
take out a few extra words, and

66
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:41,775
a few technical details that we probably
don't need in the context of this essay.

67
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:45,552
So, for example, if we're kind of reading
along here,

68
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:48,905
we get that this fungus lives
endophytically (i.e.

69
00:03:48,905 --> 00:03:49,419
inside).

70
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:50,927
Well, let's just say the word inside.

71
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:53,150
We can get rid of the technical term here.

72
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,630
This is not an essay that's about the
fungus,

73
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,140
really the fungus is just a vehicle for
this ROS discovery.

74
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,596
So we can get rid of technical terms that
have to do with the fungus for sure.

75
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:05,945
The same thing in the next sentence, I'm
just going to say the fungus,

76
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:09,030
let's not talk about the mycelium or the
hyphae or any of that.

77
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,724
I, I don't think its important in this
particular essay since the main focus is

78
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:14,670
really the ROS discovery.

79
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,120
So that, the fungus, we can get rid of all
of this detail.

80
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,890
I'm going to move this.

81
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,740
This is kind of a long sentence and it
ends with and

82
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,110
grows in perfect synchrony with the leaves
of its plant host.

83
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,070
I'm going to move this idea up.

84
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,260
Because that's really the symbiosis that
they grow in this perfect synchrony.

85
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,510
So, I'm going to say that the fungus rose
in perfect synchrony

86
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:45,340
with, we can probably just say, with the
plant, not with the leaves of the plant.

87
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,270
We're going to get the leaves next.

88
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,973
So with the plant and then colonizing.

89
00:04:50,973 --> 00:04:55,404
[BLANK_AUDIO]

90
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:58,693
Oops, colonizing.

91
00:04:58,693 --> 00:05:00,010
All of the leaves of the plant.

92
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,450
And we don't need to repeat the plant, so
colonizing all its leaves.

93
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,395
Get rid of of the plant.

94
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:14,521
Again, we get can rid of the details about
these hyphae.

95
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:19,692
But actually, we don't think we can use
the never here,

96
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:24,100
but never reaching cell walls or
membranes.

97
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,350
So just kind a, just kind of tucks that
sentence a little bit.

98
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,150
It all comes together a little bit faster
so

99
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,840
that fungus, grows in perfect synchrony
with the plant colonizing all,

100
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,330
its leaves, but never reaching cell walls
or membranes.

101
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,510
I think that gets across all the ideas
just a little bit faster.

102
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,530
In the next two sentences the author uses
the word harmonization twice.

103
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,100
I'm going to get rid of one of those
harmonizations.

104
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,410
I don't think we need to say it twice.

105
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,240
We can just say, explicitly what the plant
and the fungus do for

106
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,110
each other, so let's just say that very
explicitly.

107
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,620
Another thing to notice about this next
sentence is their you know,

108
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,100
it has the plant growth directs resources
to the production.

109
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,380
So we're getting growth directing
resources to production.

110
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,750
There's probably a way to use verbs here
to make that a little bit smoother,

111
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,790
a little bit more lively.

112
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,090
So I'm just going to say that the plant
directs resources.

113
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,390
It's really the plant that's directing the
resources to the fungus.

114
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:20,230
The plant directs resources to the fungus,
and then what does the fungus do?

115
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,120
Well, the fungus produces, so let's turn
production into produces,

116
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:31,240
produces toxins that protect the symbiosis
from herbivores, I might say both species.

117
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,990
Symbiosis sounds a little technical, so

118
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,700
maybe that protect both species from
herbivores.

119
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,420
But now this harmonization, so now we can
get the word harmonization.

120
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,130
If the author wants we can even put that
back, that exquisite harmonization.

121
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,180
The author obviously has a great
appreciation for this symbiosis.

122
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,570
So we can put that word back in.

123
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,050
But how does, exquisite harmonization is
achieved, and

124
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,050
what it's underlying mechanisms are, have
remained a mystery.

125
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,250
We probably don't need to say both.

126
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,150
How it's achieved and

127
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,490
what its mechanisms are, that's probably
all under the guise of a mechanism.

128
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,800
So we could just use the word mechanisms.

129
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,350
it's, I also want to put in a but until
Tanaka here,

130
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,750
because I feel like, well Tanaka solved
some of this mystery, right?

131
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,360
So some of this, it's, a lot of it is a
mystery, but

132
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,200
probably some of it is not anymore.

133
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,900
But until Tanaka, I want to just say
mechanisms

134
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,020
underlying this exquisite harmonization
remained a mystery.

135
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,260
So it was like a complete mystery before
Tanaka's paper, and

136
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,740
then it's made less of a mystery now.

137
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,380
Then we get a nice transition to address
this question, so we know exactly that

138
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,110
the next paragraph is going to lead us
into the the experiment that Tanaka and

139
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,070
coworkers did to address this question.

140
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,650
Again, I think there's a few things we can
streamline here.

141
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,483
So, the first sentence, it says, they
generated random mutations.

142
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:53,820
The second sentence says, how they
generated random mutations and why.

143
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,977
I think we can actually put that all into
one sentence, so

144
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:04,995
address this question, Tanaka and
coworkers, let's just say,

145
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:11,080
inserted, random pieces of DNA into the
fungal genome.

146
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,976
Then we can put in parenthesis.

147
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:19,280
A method called insertional mutagenesis.

148
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,760
So the author wanted to mentioned
insertional mutagenesis, what it was.

149
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,370
Well we can cut it.

150
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,790
That's kind of extra to put that actual
term in, but

151
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,788
we can put it in parenthesis there.

152
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:34,952
They insart, inserted random pieces of DNA
into the fungal genome in the hope of dis,

153
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:36,419
disrupting a gene.

154
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,190
Then, then we can shorten this a little
bit.

155
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,820
Instead of a gene resulting in observable
changes in growth changes in symbiosis,

156
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,690
write, I think the reader can infer, you
know,

157
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,160
that if you disrupt a gene that interrupts
growth you'll be able to.

158
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,152
To observe it, so we could just say in the
hope of disrupting genes,

159
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:57,930
critical, to the symbiosis, that are
critical for the symbiosis.

160
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,330
Critical for, critical to the symbiosis.

161
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,220
So we get all of that, all of those
concepts just in one quick sentence there,

162
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,310
and I think that's as much as the reader
needs and

163
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,280
the reader can get all the information
there.

164
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,930
They indeed found a mutant showing a
highly unusual growth pattern.

165
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,590
Colon, I like to use the colon there.

166
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,822
I might switch the indeed and they,

167
00:09:18,822 --> 00:09:21,640
the order there, although that's more of a
personal preference.

168
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,720
Indeed, they found a mutant showing a
highly unusual growth pattern.

169
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,940
I might say a mutant strain, maybe with a
highly unusual growth pattern.

170
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,620
And then after the colon, we get unlike
the synchronous growth of

171
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,770
the wild type fungus, well we've been told
that it has a synchronous growth so

172
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,220
we don't need to repeat that.

173
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,820
So, we can just say exactly what's
different about its growth.

174
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,670
Indeed, they found a mutant strain with a
highly unusual growth pattern.

175
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,110
The mutant fungal cells.

176
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,560
Again, I'm going to avoid the word hyphae,
because it's kind of technical.

177
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,569
Showed profuse and abundant proliferation.

178
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:58,843
Well, this is one of those instances where
we've gotta show pro,

179
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:02,717
proliferation, where we could just say
proliferate or even simpler, grow.

180
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:09,598
So how about just grew profusely
throughout the grass.

181
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:14,498
And then I'm going to fold this last
sentence about the plants right into this,

182
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:15,860
this other sentence.

183
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,530
I think we can fold both of those ideas
together, so

184
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,710
that mutants fungal cells grew profusely
throughout the gla,

185
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,414
grass, then what happened to the plants
and, the infected plants.

186
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:32,970
[BLANK_AUDIO]

187
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,090
And again, the author originally had
showed growth, showed poor growth.

188
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:42,260
We could just say grew poorly or grew
slowly, grew slowly and often died.

189
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,370
So I'm repeating a lot of what the author
had here but

190
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,430
just tying it into, folding it into that
last sentence.

191
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,370
Moving along, the authors then say, this
sets the stage for

192
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,490
the next step, finding the genetic changes
that cause these aborations.

193
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,860
Actually, I don't think we need any of
that.

194
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,960
The logic, the order here is so good,

195
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:09,170
that the reader can infer that once we
found a new that has aberrant growth.

196
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,540
That the next step would be to figure out
the genetics behind that.

197
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,600
I actually don't think the reader needs
quite as much hand holding here,

198
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,320
we can just jump right into the, what the
researchers did.

199
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,810
It's, again, makes logical sense that
they'd next go after the genetics.

200
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,600
So we can just start with, using molecular
genetic tools.

201
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,120
And I'm going to even condense this a
little bit further.

202
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,600
Using molecular genetic tools, the
researchers.

203
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,978
How about just found?

204
00:11:33,978 --> 00:11:37,599
[BLANK_AUDIO]

205
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,030
That in it, that an insertional event in a
single gene.

206
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,400
And then we can go right to the had
caused.

207
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,050
I'm just getting rid of some extra word
here, extra words.

208
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:57,930
And then an insertional event in a single
gene had caused this abnormal growth.

209
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,194
Yeah, no, I think we can just say this
aberrant growth.

210
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:05,285
Since I cut the word aberrant before I can
put it back in here, this aberrant growth.

211
00:12:05,285 --> 00:12:08,750
And we can end, end the sentence right
there.

212
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,110
I got rid of the concept that, somehow it
was surprising.

213
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,890
I'm not sure exactly what was surprising.

214
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,230
Is it surprising that it only mutated one
event?

215
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,470
If that's an important detail, the author
need, would need to,

216
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,890
like, explain it a little bit better for
the reader, but I just cut it out.

217
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,280
Then I'm going to make a really short
sentence.

218
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,600
Sometimes it's nice to have kind of a long
sentence.

219
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,561
And then just punctuate it with a short
sentence, so

220
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:33,395
I'm just going to make a tiny sentence
here, they called the gene, or

221
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:36,926
they named the gene, maybe named, they
named the gene NoxA.

222
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:38,752
We could just leave it at that.

223
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:43,319
We could just leave it at that, they named
the gene NoxA.

224
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:47,327
So it's a real short sentence, sometimes
nice to to break things up with kind of a,

225
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:50,593
just a short sentence in the middle of, of
a lot of long sentences.

226
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:52,425
So they named the gene, NoxA, and

227
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:55,160
then, I'm going to fold this paragraph
right into the next paragraph.

228
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,100
I want to combine the two,

229
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,620
we don't need, this doesn't need to be a
whole separate paragraph.

230
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,051
And the next paragraph talks about what
NoxA does, so

231
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:04,494
let's just put these two paragraphs
together.

232
00:13:04,494 --> 00:13:07,388
Again, we don't really need the transition
to get an idea of

233
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:09,941
what the encoded protein does because we
can it,

234
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:13,574
the reader can kind of infer that once
you've discovered the gene, the next

235
00:13:13,574 --> 00:13:17,025
thing you would be doing was trying to
figure out what the protein does.

236
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:19,247
We, you can just say what they did and

237
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:23,450
what they found in one sentence for the
next part.

238
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:31,220
So we can say, when they or when the team,
when they compared, its sequence,

239
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,410
as we've just said, the gene is NoxA, we
can say its sequence with those of

240
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,680
enzymes with known activities, and then we
can combine these two sentences.

241
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,462
They noticed that NoxA was very similar to
NADPH oxidases, enzymes,

242
00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:48,970
how about say enzymes just that generate
ROS in cells.

243
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,670
So now we get, we get back to the
beginning of

244
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,570
the essay where they were talking about
these reactive oxygen species.

245
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,140
And, I'm actually going to end this
paragraph,

246
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:05,640
this whole paragraph right now, to kind of
emphasize this over back

247
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,150
to here's where they realized how ROS
suddenly appears in symbiosis.

248
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,500
And so this is kind of the key point,

249
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,750
they finally, this is how they got upon
the concept of ROS.

250
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,920
So I'm actually going to kind of end the
paragraph here,

251
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,340
just to kind of punctuate that,

252
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,120
and make, put a little bit of emphasis on
the fact that here's where we get that

253
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,750
connection back to the beginning of the
essay and the main theme of the essay.

254
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,030
I'm going to make one other little tiny
edit here.

255
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,530
They noticed that NoxA was very similar.

256
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,550
I've told you not to use adverbs like
very.

257
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,426
I'm going to put in an adverb here.

258
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:43,480
How about strikingly similar?

259
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,170
The fact that it's strikingly similar,

260
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,200
just kind of draws the reader in a little
bit.

261
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,595
You could have just no adverb there as
well.

262
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:54,338
You could just say was similar, but
somehow strikingly similar makes it

263
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:57,158
seem more exciting so I am going to leave
that in.

264
00:14:57,158 --> 00:15:00,103
Then I am going to start a new paragraph
down here

265
00:15:00,103 --> 00:15:02,470
where the author starts with indeed.

266
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,880
This author likes the transition word
indeed.

267
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,660
Cause we've already used it once before I
think I'll just say

268
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,370
further testing revealed, like this is
kind of the follow up studies to

269
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,550
their first discovery of the link with
ROS.

270
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,364
So further test, testing revealed that.

271
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:25,165
And then we can shorten things a little
bit here when the researchers next

272
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:28,109
looked at ROS production in the plant,
they observed.

273
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:29,789
I think we just say what they observed.

274
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:32,606
We don't have to say that they looked for
ROS production in the plant,

275
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:35,376
because that's sort of implied by the fact
that they observed it, so

276
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:36,544
we can get rid of all of that.

277
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:42,579
So, that, they observed that ROS further
testing revealed

278
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:48,630
that ROS accumulates in plants infected by
the wild type fungus.

279
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:53,015
[BLANK_AUDIO]

280
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:55,299
That should just be a single little hyphen
in there and

281
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:57,790
plants infected by the wild type fungus.

282
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,560
And not those infected by the NoxA
disrupted mutant fungus, and we can say

283
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,220
but not those infected maybe just

284
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,810
by the NoxA mutants, just to make that a
little bit shorter, by the NoxA mutants.

285
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:18,030
So further testing revealed, that ROS
accumulates in plants infected by

286
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,430
the wild type fungus, but not those
infected by the NoxA mutants.

287
00:16:22,784 --> 00:16:27,559
This confirmed that I'm going to change
this to the scientists concluded that.

288
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:31,244
The only reason I'm doing that is that
confirmed sounds like as if

289
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:35,476
we've know this for a while, but this is a
really a totally new discovery.

290
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:38,794
So I'm going to say that they concluded
that NoxA,

291
00:16:38,794 --> 00:16:44,125
is involved in ROS production, requiring
for proper functioning of the symbiosis.

292
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:48,157
I think we can shorten that to the
scientists concluded,

293
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:51,269
that ROS is a critical player in
symbiosis.

294
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:58,410
ROS is a critical player in the symbiosis.

295
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,040
This is kind of the proof of what was said
at the very beginning of the essay that,

296
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,910
hey, this new role for ROS.

297
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,220
We get down to the last paragraph,

298
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,360
they had the tantalizing questions that
this discovery raises.

299
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,450
I'm going to fold together the first two
sentences here.

300
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,560
The, it raises tantalizing questions, the,
this is the main question,

301
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,540
we can put that all in one.

302
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:27,920
So it's just, how about, how ROS enables
symbiosis remains an open question.

303
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,970
Because that's really what this paragraph
is about,

304
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,850
is it, exactly what are the mechanisms
that ROS uses to help in the symbiosis.

305
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,990
And then we can say since I've deleted
Tanaka and

306
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,240
colleague, maybe I'll say Tanaka and
colleagues here, or Tanaka's team.

307
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,460
suggest, now this is kind of in the past
at this point because it was a 2006 paper,

308
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,050
so how about Tanaka's team speculated that
ROS may be involved.

309
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,022
I'm going to use may here,

310
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:57,560
because then, to be parallel with the next
sentence, which uses a may.

311
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,720
That ROS may be involved in establishing
physical connections between the cell

312
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,240
walls of the plant and fungus.

313
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,540
So that's one explanation.

314
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:09,050
Alternatively, ROS may play a role in
symbiotic signaling.

315
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:13,990
And I prefer a semicolon here to a colon
because the second part of the sentence

316
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,140
just adding information, it doesn't really
build on the first part of the sentence.

317
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,900
So, just personal preference I prefer a
semicolon here.

318
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,420
Their short half life predisposes them for
cellular communication perhaps

319
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,920
facilitating an interspecies Morse code
that helps maintain the symbiosis.

320
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,610
I think we can dump a few words here.

321
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,973
So their short half life makes them a
perfect candidate for

322
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:36,041
an interspecies Morse code.

323
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:41,969
[BLANK_AUDIO]

324
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:43,530
For an interspecies Morse code.

325
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,850
We don't I don't think we have to repeat
that helps maintain the symbiosis since

326
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,319
this whole paragraph is about exactly how
ROS maintains the symbiosis.

327
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,530
If so, identifying the plant sensor and

328
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,930
signaling pathways involved, that's
kind of long.

329
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,255
How about we just said if so

330
00:18:58,255 --> 00:19:01,522
breaking the code, as we've just referred
to this Morse code.

331
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:05,966
Breaking the code could provide deeper
insight into how plants recognize and

332
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:07,890
interact with their symbiotes.

333
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,940
And and just to be parallel, we've got
could provide deeper insights into how

334
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,790
plants recognize and interact and
distinguish.

335
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,725
We don't want want to have and

336
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:17,510
can distinguish just because that wouldn't
be parallel.

337
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,340
Then I feel like we need just a tiny
paragraph here to wrap up

338
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,930
the the, the essay.

339
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,620
I've got these open questions, but
remember, the big point here

340
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,310
is that Tanakas Group discovered that ROS
has this Is entirely different role.

341
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,390
We used to think that they were just bad
players, and

342
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,560
now it turns out they do these good things
for symbiosis.

343
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,920
So I feel like we need a little bit of
wrapping up that and

344
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,470
reminding the reader of that fundamental
point.

345
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,790
So, maybe something like,

346
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:51,310
Tanaka's paper fundamentally changed
scientists' views of ROS.

347
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,840
These chemicals, and

348
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,600
I'm going to, now kind of wrap back to the
beginning metaphor of warfare here.

349
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:05,571
These chemicals are not only weapons of
biological warfare.

350
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,327
Also agents of peace and cooperation.

351
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:13,649
[BLANK_AUDIO]

352
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:16,100
So just kind of getting back to that
metaphor.

353
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,710
Notice that I've told you never to use
nots.

354
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,860
Well, I didn't say never to use nots but I
said you know, to try to avoid nots.

355
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,122
I've chosen to use a not here.

356
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:23,613
These chemicals are not only.

357
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:27,191
So sometimes, for effect you might choose
to use a not, but

358
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:29,680
just think carefully about it before you
do so.

359
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,320
And then I wonder if maybe, there's some
wider implications for biology.

360
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,360
This discovery seems important to me.

361
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,290
I've heard that, you know, ROS are these
bad players,

362
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,620
what does it mean that they might have
important good roles too?

363
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,960
So is there some wider implications for

364
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,310
biology in general that the reader, that
the author could add here just right at

365
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,940
the end to give the reader a taste of why
this paper is so important?
