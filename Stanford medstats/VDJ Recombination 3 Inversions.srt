1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,580
Now this is the third part of the story,
it's a kind of an add on

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,930
to explain to students, how inversions can
occur during D to J recombination.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,710
I'm going to draw for

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,130
you the kind of an abbreviated version of
the immunoglobulin gene.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,930
So, I'm going to give you

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,849
[BLANK_AUDIO]

7
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:22,738
A D region.

8
00:00:22,738 --> 00:00:24,130
Here's a D region.

9
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,740
Just as in the previous diagrams, here's
the D region.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,150
And I'm going to give you a J region

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:45,020
[BLANK_AUDIO]

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,900
That's downstream from it.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,140
Here's the J region.
And

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,270
I'm going to draw upstream of D region.

15
00:00:55,973 --> 00:01:03,264
[SOUND]
V region.

16
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:10,990
And so, we're going to do D to J joining,
except remember the recombination

17
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:19,200
activating genes are RAG1 and RAG2, always
do cleavages between.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,600
A red RSS and a blue RSS.

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,100
A red recombination signal sequence and a
blue recombination signal sequence.

20
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,700
So just it doesn't really know how they're
oriented, because it doesn't really care.

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,330
And DNA can fold up anyway.

22
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,430
So, suppose.

23
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,860
Rag one and rag two do their cleavages at
these arrows.

24
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,780
So there's no reason why they can't, they
just follow the rules.

25
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,990
They just recognize recombination signal
sequences, and do the cleavage.

26
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,570
And so you end up with the following
cleavage.

27
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:55,622
So let me draw that cleavage for you.

28
00:01:55,622 --> 00:02:02,687
[SOUND]
And this

29
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:11,519
is their uncleaved part.

30
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:15,493
And this is.

31
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,230
The cleaved part.

32
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:27,290
Oop, looks, hm, let me do that and make it
cleaner for you.

33
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,900
And so, there we are.

34
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,620
Okay there's the J, there's the D,

35
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,580
and then there are spaces for the two
cleavages.

36
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,780
And now having done this, remember the,
the recombination rag one and rag two,

37
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,500
the recombination activating genes, stay
stuck on the signal ends,

38
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,520
covering them up and not allowing them to
be joined right away.

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,730
So as a result, there are two coating
ends.

40
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,130
One end for the D, one end for the J.

41
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,490
And they're going to end up getting joined
to each other.

42
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:05,630
So in order for that to happen, this piece
of DNA has to swing around,

43
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,460
to come over here.

44
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,400
And so, ,.

45
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,880
Obviously, the other side of the DNA swing
around, and come over here.

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,750
So, let's, let's draw the swing around, so
that you can see everything.

47
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,055
It's now going to look like this.

48
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:29,140
[SOUND]

49
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,140
And I am just swinging everything around.

50
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:42,504
So it's all backwards.

51
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:49,334
[BLANK_AUDIO]

52
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:51,896
Hm, okay.

53
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:58,730
[BLANK_AUDIO]

54
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:09,410
[BLANK_AUDIO]

55
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,250
So you can see, that all I've done is take
that middle segment,

56
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,190
and rotated it around.

57
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,360
So that, the D region over here, is now
backwards.

58
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,910
And I'm going to designate it as
backwards.

59
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:26,630
By drawing d in a backwards fashion and
the J region's still sitting

60
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,850
here waiting to be drawn to the delusion.

61
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,320
And the, the perferial sequel sequences
are,

62
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,750
are still there right waiting to be
joined.

63
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,246
And now when the joining occurs.

64
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:39,928
Boom.

65
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:45,850
You've, you've not got an inversion of the
segment containing the D.

66
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,360
From the D segment all the way up to a
recombination signal sequence.

67
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,700
So that's how the inversion will occur.

68
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,760
Okay, thank you.
