2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,290
Okay, now you've done a root cause
analysis.

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,060
If you figure out what the system process
issues, you have implemented solutions.

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,100
Now how do you, how do you roll things
out.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,470
And then, double check to make sure things
are maintained or sustained.

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,920
Some implementations of how you think
about permanent changes to

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,200
the way work is done.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,600
And as such involves building the change
into the organization.

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,640
Hard wiring is a phrase we often time use
because you're

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,240
talking about changing behavior.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,830
You're talking about changing process.

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,366
You're talking about changing culture
sometimes in order to

13
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:48,980
make sure that the bad event never occurs
again.

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,120
Sustaining is making sure you lock in
those processes that the organization's

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,110
have already have put into place, and then
continuing building on it.

16
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,800
And that's the Institute of Healthcare
Improvement, IHI's, approach.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,450
And making sure that those actions are
actually hard wired or

18
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,810
put in place to make sure it doesn't
happen again.

19
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,690
So, some considerations or some
suggestion,

20
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,082
maybe consider doing a test of change,
where you take a couple of staff in

21
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:25,349
a particular area to use the revised form
or process, whatever is that was changed.

22
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,451
We actually implementing a change, now
you're looking at everybody involved in

23
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:34,430
a particular area to use a particular form
or that particular process.

24
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,370
And it is constantly reassessment or

25
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,330
remeasuring the process to make sure it's
working.

26
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,042
And of course going to the staff who's
involved with the process to make sure

27
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:47,580
that you get feedback from them regarding
what's working, what's not working.

28
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,740
This fine tuning, this tweaking, is where
the improvement concept actually falls

29
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,220
in because it's just like patient care.

30
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,880
When you're doing these improvements, and

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,780
you have a patient who presents what's a
elevated, glycosylated hemoglobin, or

32
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,850
that they come in with elevated blood
pressure.

33
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,450
And you have 'em on meditations or if you
did a procedure and

34
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,480
then, then quite correct it then you need
to back and do it.

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,616
That process itself is a performance
improvement program that you

36
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:16,940
are doing with the patient.

37
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,098
So, you know, keep in mind that, it's the
same concept that we

38
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:25,025
are talking about from a clinical care
standpoint, that you

39
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:30,440
are actually implementing in terms of a
larger macro level system process issue.

40
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,254
Some of the tools that we'll have
available through links on this program,

41
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:44,360
includes the Stanford University Medical
Center National Patient Safety Goal

42
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,020
badge cards.

43
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,210
One of the tools that have been used in,
Stanford's hospital and

44
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,550
clinics, periop region is the WHO Surgical
Checklist.

45
00:02:54,786 --> 00:03:00,927
SBAR communication situation background
assessment and recommendation,

46
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:06,489
was something that was developed by Kaiser
Permanente in Colorado.

47
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:09,795
And it's used pretty much, world wide now,

48
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:15,230
as a way of communicating urgent emergent
situation among team members.

49
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:22,570
The High Reliability Organization article
that's kind of a landmark article,

50
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,388
that Joint Commission uses, that was
authored by Dr.

51
00:03:26,388 --> 00:03:31,820
Chassin the President and CEO of the Joint
Commission with Gerald Loeb.

52
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,460
There's Culture of Safety article that
were included,

53
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,810
as well as prevention of Medical Error
articles that you'll have available.

54
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,770
One great resource that's been around for

55
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,522
almost ten years now is a AHRQ funded
program that was

56
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:53,520
done through the department defense is the
concept of TeamSTEPPS.

57
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,417
And TeamSTEPPS is a whole communication
culture system that many

58
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:02,816
organizations have adopted, that could
help facilitate team

59
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:09,120
communication among interdisciplinary and
interdisciplinary team members.

60
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,790
And the website is listed on the slide.

61
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,736
You may want to check in terms of the tons
of resources they have available.

62
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:19,980
And programs that are available that we
put on across the country.

63
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,660
So with that we've had an opportunity to
review a little bit of the history about

64
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,190
medical error and the movement about the
patient safety initiative.

65
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,590
We've talked about the high reliability
organization and

66
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,790
where that fits in health care today.

67
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,340
We've reviewed the process of conducting a
root cause analysis.

68
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,742
And review some case scenarios,

69
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:46,830
where they're actually adverse medical
error events that has actually happened.

70
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,600
And some of the learnings and system
processes that were put in place.

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,630
We hope that you found this program
informative, helpful.

72
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,930
And if there's any question please feel
free to contact me.

73
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,279
And I look forward to hearing from you.

74
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,361
Thank you, very much.
