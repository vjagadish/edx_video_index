00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,210
Hi, my name is Sharon Chen, and

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,650
this video is on, Virus structure
classification and pathogenesis.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,680
This is part of our Introduction to
Microbiology module.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,880
The Learning Objectives are to identify
the distinctive structures of a virus, and

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,860
describe their function.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,210
To describe viral virulence, to describe
viral pathogenesis, to recognize

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,160
that viruses constantly evolve and adapt
to changing selective pressures, and

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,870
to distinguish the different ways of
cataloging viruses.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,970
What is a Virus?

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,030
A Virus is defined as a small infectious
agent.

11
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,980
It is Submicroscopic.

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,420
It is not a living organism in contrast to
bacteria.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,770
And it does not have ribosomes.

14
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,590
A Virus is an obligate intracellular
parasite.

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,369
It is completely dependent on a living
host cell for reproduction.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,390
The infectious virus particle is called a
Virion and

17
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,070
is composed of a limited number of
structures.

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,960
The Capsid is a protein coat that protects
the nucleic acid genome.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,849
The Capsid can also be used for attachment
to a host cell.

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,740
The Envelope is found only in some viruses
and

21
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,510
consists of a Lipid membrane derived from
host cell membrane.

22
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,090
The envelope functions as an extra
protective layer.

23
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,490
Glycoproteins are anchored in the envelope
and are used by the virus for

24
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,010
attachment to a host cell.

25
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,550
The origin of viruses is debated.

26
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:39,040
Theories include one, that viruses were
once just Genetic elements that

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,000
gained the ability to exit one cell and
enter another.

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,370
Two, viruses transformed from a free
living organism into a parasite.

29
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,379
Could viruses be the Precursor of life?

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,190
Viruses are not a living organism.

31
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,950
They are not part of the tree of life, as
you can see in the image.

32
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,900
However, viruses infect all living things,
including Bacteria, Fungi, and Animals.

33
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,030
In fact, viruses are part of us.

34
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,590
Each bacteria in our intestines can be a
home for a virus.

35
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,140
And a portion of our DNA, comes from
endogenous retroviruses.

36
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,060
Viruses have evolved and will continue to
evolve.

37
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,440
Emerging viruses, prove this point.

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,510
Most of the recent, new emerging viruses
are zoonotic.

39
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,750
The viruses is transmitted from animal to
man, either directly or via a vector.

40
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,800
The animal serves as a reservoir, and

41
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,810
wild animals, wildlife, are increasingly
implicated in zoonoses.

42
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,560
New viral infections on humans evolve
based on two concepts.

43
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,770
One New viruses arise from mutations,
reassortment, or recombinations.

44
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,590
These new viruses attempt to achieve
successful replication within old and

45
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,360
new host.

46
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,605
Two, New environments develop that place
humans in closer contact to animals.

47
00:02:57,605 --> 00:03:02,554
Ecology changes and an increase in world
travel can create these new environments.

48
00:03:02,554 --> 00:03:05,900
[BLANK_AUDIO]

49
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,580
Virus replication is host cell-dependent.

50
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,880
The virus life cycle steps include the
virus attaches to

51
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,880
specific receptors on a host cell.

52
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,710
It then enters the cell through
endocytosis.

53
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,700
The virus uses the host cell machinery to
replicate its nucleic acid and

54
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,820
to make necessary proteins.

55
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,170
The nucleic acids and structural
components are assembled into new virions.

56
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,469
The new virions are released from the host
cell by budding or lysis.

57
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,100
Envelope viruses release with a layer, an
envelope, of the host cell membrane.

58
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,980
Viral Pathogenesis is how a virus
infection causes disease in a host.

59
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,180
Disease in a host is an effect of both
viral replication and

60
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,670
host immune response.

61
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,800
Viral pathogenesis is determined by,
Interaction with specific host cells.

62
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,220
Interaction with immune system.

63
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,620
Host immune response causing pathology.

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,260
And virus are host immune response changes
to cell growth potential.

65
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,530
First, the interaction with specific host
cells.

66
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,395
Disease manifestation in human is dictated
by the specific host cell that

67
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,400
the virus attaches and enters.

68
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,970
For example, HIV attaches and enters into
CD4T cells,

69
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,470
which are important for protecting against
many types of infections.

70
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,390
Patients with HIV infection, have low
numbers of CD4T cells, and

71
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,070
subsequently succumb to many different
types of infections.

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,750
Interactions with the immune system
includes multiple concepts.

73
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,890
First, Viral Immune Escape.

74
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,950
One main mechanism of escaping from the
immune system is to

75
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,500
change what the immune cells recognize.

76
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,050
Immune cells recognize pieces of protein
called Antigens.

77
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,190
HIV is a good example of the tremendous
amount of antigenic variation that

78
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,660
occurs during replication.

79
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,730
This image shows you antigenic variation
of HIV in red,

80
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,600
compared to influenza virus in black.

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,310
Although the image shows a relatively
small amount of antigenic variation for

82
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,990
influenza, the antigen changes necessitate
a change in

83
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,030
the seasonal influenza vaccine, year to
year.

84
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,460
Development of an HIV vaccine continues to
be a challenge.

85
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,050
Immune modulation or immune evasion.

86
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,640
Viruses depend on and have co evolved with
its host.

87
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,600
Thus for successful propagation, viruses
have to overcome host immune defenses.

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,140
Viruses have evolved mechanisms to
modulate or

89
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,130
evade almost every aspect of the host
immune system.

90
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,976
For example, many viruses block or inhibit
interference.

91
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:55,310
A side of kind that functions as a key
first line anti viral defense for a cell.

92
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,754
Many viruses also block [UNKNOWN] of the
cell in order to

93
00:05:58,754 --> 00:06:00,980
complete its replication cycle.

94
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,950
Avoiding immune surveillance.

95
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,470
Another strategy that some viruses use is
to hide in a location that

96
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,890
has low immune surveillance, that is
patrolling by immune cells.

97
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,409
An example would be Virusella oster virus
hiding in the dorsal root, ganglion.

98
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,780
The host immune response alone can cause
pathology.

99
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,020
Acute lung injury and acute respiratory
distress syndrome are a result of

100
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,060
a runaway immune response of
pro-inflammatory cytokines.

101
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,250
Certain respiratory viruses can induce
this clinical picture, including the 2009

102
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:41,880
Pandemic H1N1 influenza virus and SARS
corona virus.

103
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,470
Virus Pathogenesis can also be determined
by virus or host immune response

104
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,190
changes to the cell growth potential, this
is called viral transformation.

105
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,820
Viral transformation of cells can lead to
uncontrolled cell replication and

106
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,440
formation of tumors, thus some viruses can
cause cancer.

107
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,920
These are called Oncogenic viruses.

108
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,650
Hepatitis B is an example of an oncogenic
virus.

109
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,240
Chronic Hepatitis B infection could lead
to hepatocellular carcinoma,

110
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,230
which is depicted in the pathology image.

111
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:21,160
It is important to note that inducing
cancer is not required for

112
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,620
the virus to propagate.

113
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,170
Viral Virulence is the capacity of the
virus to cause disease and

114
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,900
can be affected by both the virus and the
host.

115
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,260
In virology, the determine of virulence is
predominantly based

116
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,330
on viral genetics with a focus on
mutations in viral genes.

117
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,430
Mutations in viral genes can change Viral
replication.

118
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,170
Higher replication rates may be associated
with higher virulence and

119
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,460
can change Viral spread.

120
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,150
The ability of a virus to disseminate may
be associated with higher virulence.

121
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,250
The host can also affect Viral Virulence.

122
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,950
A virus may be much more virulent in an
immunocompromised host.

123
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,880
Compared to one who is immunocompetent.

124
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,070
Although much focus is on viruses with
increased virulence the concept of

125
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,730
reduced virulence is equally important.

126
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,790
It has called Attenuation and is the
Conceptual basis for

127
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,970
many live viral vaccines.

128
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,934
Viruses can be organized by their
architecture.

129
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:26,800
The shape, Icosahedral, cylindrical or
complex.

130
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,520
The presence or not of an envelope
surrounding the capsid and

131
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,530
by their size which can range from 20 to
400 nanometers.

132
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,490
Viruses can also be organized by their
nucleic acid, DNA or RNA.

133
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,990
A common organizational scheme used by
virologists.

134
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,370
Is the Baltimore Classification.

135
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:53,390
It catalogs all viruses into seven groups
based on the specific type of DNA or RNA.

136
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,010
In order to fully propagate,

137
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:01,330
the virus must produce messenger RNA, mRNA
to then produce protein.

138
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,510
Messenger RNA is the central link for

139
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,970
all seven groups in the Baltimore
classification.

140
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,910
The image on this slide also highlights
the diversity of

141
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,770
viral nucleic acid compared to nucleic
acid for all living things.

142
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,810
All the non viruses, only have double
stranded DNA.

143
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,550
Biologically, RNA and DNA viruses are
different.

144
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,380
During RNA synthesis, RNA viruses do not
have proofreading mechanisms.

145
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,540
So these viruses are prone to replication
error.

146
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,020
DNA viruses are not because they do have
proofreading mechanisms.

147
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,550
RNA viruses must encode their own enzymes
for RNA replication.

148
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,940
DNA viruses can use host cell enzymes.

149
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:52,460
RNA viruses tend to cross species barriers
and infect several different hosts.

150
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,170
DNA viruses tend to be species-specific.

151
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:01,750
Differences between the RNA and DNA
viruses have clinical implications.

152
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,190
Mutations from replication errors can
affect virulence,

153
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,340
that is capacity of the virus to cause
disease.

154
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,860
Mutations can also enable a virus to be
con-resistant to an antiviral medication.

155
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,590
This concept is the basis of using
multiple antiviral medications to

156
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,190
treat HIV infections.

157
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:26,150
The use of virus encoded enzymes is an
ideal target for antivirals medications.

158
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,000
Less side effects will be observed in the
host compared to

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,860
antiviral medications that target host
cell enzymes.

160
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,400
Viral transmission among different types
of hosts and prevention of transmission

161
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,800
should be considered more often for RNA
viruses compared to DNA viruses.

162
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,360
Viruses can be classified into viral
families.

163
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,960
The family names end with viridae, for
example, Herpesviridae.

164
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,075
In this family are multiple species
including herpes simplex virus, HSV, and

165
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,160
[UNKNOWN] zoster virus, VZV.

166
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,130
Of the virus that infect humans, there are
seven families of DNA viruses and

167
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,090
13 families of RNA viruses.

168
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,939
