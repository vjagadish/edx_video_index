2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,300
Welcome to unit eight.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,670
This week we're going to start our
discussion of regression methods that

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,339
handle repeated measures outcome.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,730
So this week we're going to be talking
about generalized estimating equations,

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,270
which is one of the regression methods
that handles repeated measures data.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,190
And there are many benefits of using a
regression method for

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,430
handling repeated measures data.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,020
We saw last week that if we wanted to use
repeated measures ANOVA or

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,340
repeated measures MANOVA that there were a
number of limitations to those methods.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,870
So for one thing they assume that time is
categorical.

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,225
Everybody has to be measured at the same
time point and

13
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:49,050
forMANOVA those time points had to be sort
of equally spaced time intervals.

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,750
With regression, with generalized
estimating equations and

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,020
next week we'll see with mixed models you
can treat time as continuous.

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,940
Everybody can have different time points
that they're measured at.

17
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,220
Also the ANOVA methods don't handle time
dependent covariants.

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,950
And as you all learned on the midterm, the
time changing predictors are very,

19
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,270
very important.

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,740
And the regression methods will
incorporate and handle.

21
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,240
these.

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,190
For ANOVA you have to impute missing data,
or

23
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,870
anybody who's missing even one time point
will be thrown out of the analysis.

24
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,110
With the regression methods, you don't
necessarily have to

25
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,310
impute the missing data because people
will only be thrown out.

26
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,950
At the time points that they missed.

27
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,760
The ANOVA methods have some more
restrictive assumptions.

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,470
Particularly uni-variant repeated
measures,

29
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,410
ANOVA had a restrictive assumption about
the correlation structure.

30
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,610
The regression methods don't necessarily
require such restrictive assumptions.

31
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,840
And if you notice when we did a NOVA, we
didn't get any parameters estimates.

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,290
We didn't get any measures of effect size,
for example.

33
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,700
We just got p values.

34
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,410
We'd also like to be able to get some beta
coefficients,

35
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,020
some estimates of effect size and
regression.

36
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,270
We'll bias that as well.
