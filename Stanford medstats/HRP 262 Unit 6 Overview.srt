[BLANK_AUDIO].

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,120
Welcome to unit six.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,360
This week we're going to switch modes.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,380
We're now done with our discussion of
survival analysis.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,280
And the second half of the course is
going to focus on repeated measures data.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,280
This is the situation where you've
measured an outcome variable on

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,500
the same people.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,850
At multiple time points.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,900
So, most of the outcomes that we're
going to look at in the second half of

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,500
this course are actually going to be
continuous outcomes.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,760
Things like blood pressure, weight, and
bone density.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,510
Because of that, we're mostly going to be
dealing with linear models.

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,540
The statistical models that I'm going to
give you are going to be

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,380
extensions of our basic ANOVA and linear
regression models.

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,850
So what I thought I'd do for the.

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,860
Beginning of this week is actually to
review basic ANOVA and linear regression.

17
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,700
Before we complicate them and add the
complexity of repeated measures,

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,820
let's make sure we're all on the same page
about just the basics of ANOVA and

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,920
linear regression.

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,610
This week I'll also just give you an
introduction.

21
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,870
To what does repeated measures data look
like.

22
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,040
So, I'll show you some examples from the
literature.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,200
I'll talk about the different data
structures for repeated measures.

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,120
There's actually kind of two ways to
structure the data and

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,710
depending on what you're trying to do in
the computer you nee,

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,190
you may need it in one or the other form.

27
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:24,120
And I'll also give you some examples of
how to plot your repeated-measures data.

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,310
Plotting is going to be very important
here for

29
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,250
you get to get a real understanding of
what's going on in the data.

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,060
Just to ground us on where are we on our
statistical chart of tasks, so

31
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,730
again I will talk a little bit about some
binary repeated measures.

32
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,970
Outcome data in the second half of this
course, but

33
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,350
I'm mostly going to fit, focus on
continuous outcomes.

34
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,940
So, if we have continuous outcomes, these
are things like again, blood pressure,

35
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,880
weight, pain scale, cognitive function on
some kind of continuous scale.

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,600
If we have independent groups, or
independent observations,

37
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,660
we're going to be doing something like a
basic ANOVA or a basic linear regression.

38
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,910
I'm going to review those this week.

39
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,180
If we add correlations into the picture.

40
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,980
We have some source of correlation.

41
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,000
Such as that we've measured the same
people over time,

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,390
then we're going to need slightly more
complicated statistical tests.

43
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,360
So in the next three weeks I'm going to
review repeated measures in ANOVA,

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,750
mixed models and GEE models.

45
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,490
These will handle the correlation due to
having the same people over time.

46
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,220
They would also handle other sources of
correlation such as

47
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,940
clustering although I'm mostly going to
focus on the problem of repeated measures.

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,410
This week again though I'm not going to go
over any specific statistical tests for

49
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,120
the repeated measures, I'm just going to
talk about the basic data structure.

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,660
So what does the data look like that we're
going to be dealing with in

51
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,700
the second half of this.

52
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,620
course.

53
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,240
Here is just an example of some data that
I analyzed a number of years ago.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,170
This was a data set which was a
longitudinal data set.

55
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,700
So women were measured over time.

56
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,610
These were women runners, and we measured
their bone density at base line.

57
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,770
And about a year later, and then about two
years later.

58
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,380
What you're seeing here is the changes in
bone density over time for

59
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,110
three different groups of women.

60
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,200
And the way that I've presented the data
here is to show you that I started.

61
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,580
I'm presenting it as the mean change from
base line.

62
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,010
So everybody starts at zero.

63
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,030
That's the base line value.

64
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,380
And then I'm giving, every woman gets her
percent change from her base line value.

65
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,290
This is one way to.

66
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,850
Present repeated-measures outcome data.

67
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,470
And you can see that what happens is that
the group in blue here,

68
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,130
they have a slight decrease in the first
year, and

69
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,250
then they kind of go back up to what they
started at.

70
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,450
But they basically have no change overall.

71
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,960
In their bone density.

72
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,400
in contrast, the groups that are in red
and

73
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
black here have some increase in their
bone density over time.

74
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,620
About a two or 3% increase for those
groups.

75
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,770
So these are the types of data that we're
going to be looking at for

76
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,890
the rest of this course.
