1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,750
In this next module I'll just walk you
through an example of the use of

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,720
time dependent predictors in the
literature.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,832
Just to get some practice with the idea of
using time dependent predictors.

4
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:21,370
I'm going to show you a study from the
literature that was looking at whether or

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,850
not antidepressant use, women who take
antidepressants during pregnancy,

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,100
does that prevent major episodes of
depression?

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,699
So you can imagine that a woman who has
depression may have to wrestle with

8
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,953
the question of, should I continue taking
my antidepressants during pregnancy.

9
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:40,430
Obviously, you know, we generally, caution
women against taking too

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,570
many drugs during pregnancy because of
potential impacts on the fetus.

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,860
And but, if the antidepressants can
prevent a major episode of depression,

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,260
then there might be reason for some women
to actually take them.

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,020
The risks the benefits would outweigh the
risks in that case.

14
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,570
So, trying to get at that question there
was some authors who had data from from

15
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,710
a large cohort study,

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,440
they did an analysis of 778 pregnant women
who all had a history of depression.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,970
And the predictor of interest here with
the use of antidepressants, but you can

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,560
imagine something like antidepressants is
going to change over time.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,100
Some women may start or stop taking them
during their pregnancy.

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,780
So, they're going to, we're going to model
this as a time-dependent predictor.

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,000
The outcome here was the time to the first
major depressive episode,

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,900
if a woman had one.

23
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,860
You can imagine that one way that the
others could've looked at

24
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,920
this data is they could have just said,

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,140
did the women ever take antidepressants
during the study or not?

26
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,090
That's going to be a problem, as you'll
see.

27
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,950
Because you can imagine that if you just
use the ever never variable, women who

28
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,600
have a major episode of depression during
pregnancy may then get on,

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,350
may start taking an antidepressant.

30
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,350
So you'd have some kind of reverse
causality.

31
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,010
So it's a really good use of
time-dependent predictors here

32
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,770
to allow antidepressant use to change over
time.

33
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,280
Baseline use of antidepressant also may
not be a very good measure here.

34
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,040
Because some women may choose to go on
antidepressants, but

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,850
may not be on them right at the beginning
of the study.

36
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,940
And just to get some practice reading
statistical method sections a lot of

37
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,290
you are going to have to go on to write
these eventually.

38
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,370
So I am just going to show you what they
wrote about their predictor from their

39
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,520
statistical methods section.

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,160
So, we use cost regression to model risk
for a major depressive episode.

41
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,619
That's the their outcome variable.

42
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:26,920
And major depressive episodes hat to last
at least two weeks,

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,280
that's part of definition of the outcome
here.

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,900
What was the risk period they were looking
at?

45
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,060
So, the risk period that they were looking
at was from the second month of

46
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,640
pregnancy to two months postpartum.

47
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,970
So, women were followed for those time
periods.

48
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,710
They were at risk of getting a major
episode of depression.

49
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,180
From two months into the pregnancy to two
months post partum.

50
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,990
Now interestingly they, there was some
missing data so some of

51
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,720
the women they didn't actually know if
they had a major depressive episode.

52
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,130
Some of them maybe, you know,

53
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,200
lost, were, they lost them or they just
didn't have that data.

54
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,330
So those missing data were treated as
censored for the primary model.

55
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,890
They also just to see what would happen.

56
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,710
They did what's called a sensitivity
analysis where they also said everybody

57
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,140
who we don't really know, we didn't follow
them for the entire period of the study.

58
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,010
What if all of them went on and actually
did have a major depressive episode?

59
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,850
How could that affect the results?

60
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,380
So they tried treating all of them as
having the event rather than being

61
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,430
censored just to see how it affected the
results.

62
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,410
So, that's called a sensitivity analysis.

63
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,730
You'll see that sometimes when people have
missing data.

64
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,210
And another interesting point on this, in
this method section, for

65
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,780
each model, we used the exact method of
computation to account for

66
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,840
a large number of ties in times to event.

67
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,590
So, last week we talked about the issue of
ties.

68
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,630
And in this particular study they were
looking on a monthly basis.

69
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,330
They were updating antidepressant use and
outcomes every month.

70
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,170
So, there's only you know nine months,

71
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,750
only kind of nine time points here in this
study.

72
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,800
So there's an awful lot of ties.

73
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,500
A lot of women could have depressive
episode in the same month of pregnancy.

74
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,330
Large number of ties therefore they
decided to go with the exact method to

75
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,060
get it, you know, as precise as possible.

76
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,900
And again the exact method computationally
is, is, probably, you know,

77
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,250
most computers can handle it.

78
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,870
Even for 778 women.

79
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,550
All right.
So then the primary exposure of

80
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,060
interest was antidepressant treatment, a
time-dependent variable.

81
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,520
Okay.
So they were allowing this to

82
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,100
change over time.

83
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,850
We examine models comparing treatment with
onset of major depressive episode during

84
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,240
the corresponding months.

85
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,650
So we also created models for time-lagged
antidepressant indicators so they

86
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,280
could just put it in you're either not on
antidepressants or not in a given month.

87
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,070
However, the potential problem with that
is since time

88
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,720
isn't measured very precisely here you can
imagine if

89
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,410
a woman has a major depressive episode in
a given month.

90
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,190
She may then as a result of that start
taking antidepressants.

91
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,800
And so if you don't look, you know, you
know, if you don't put a time lag in,

92
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,650
you may catch some women who are on
antidepressants at

93
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,060
the time of major depressive episodes
simply because you haven't measured time

94
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,790
finally enough to realize that she got on
them after.

95
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,361
So, they did some time lag models.

96
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:01,011
They said,

97
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:05,470
you have to have been on antidepressants
at least a month before the event time.

98
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,290
Or at least two months, or

99
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,900
at least three months, to resolve this
issue of causal ordering.

100
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,450
In the end, they chose a lag of two
months.

101
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,010
So, you were only counted us on, as being
on antidepressants,

102
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,280
if you were on them for at least two
months.

103
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,210
Just to make sure that there was none, you
know, reverse causality here.

104
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,540
So that was their model.

105
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,550
Here is the results from the study of this
slide.

106
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,520
You can't really see to much so I'm
going to zoom in now on the results.

107
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,910
So this is from their multi-variant Cox
regression model.

108
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,610
They're presenting the unadjusted and
adjusted hazard ratios.

109
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,680
They adjusted for a lot of things because
this was an observational study.

110
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,980
You can imagine there are a lot of
potential confounders here.

111
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,910
Of course, the variable we care about is
this time-dependent antidepressant use.

112
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,180
And so when they look at antidepressant
use in the un-adjusted model the hazard

113
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:51,880
ratio was 0.85.

114
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,180
It's slightly protected but certainly not
statistically significant.

115
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,010
In the adjusted model it's 0.88.

116
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:01,460
So there's really no evidence that being
on antidepressants during pregnancy,

117
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,750
at least in this data set,

118
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,090
seems to prevent, it doesn't seem to
prevent a major episodes of depression.

119
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,260
It's trending a little bit in the
protective range, but

120
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,440
clearly very close to one there.

121
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,910
So that's the answer from the study, and
you would interpret as that, you know,

122
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,630
being on antidepressents at a given time
doesn't seemed to

123
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,850
prevent against depression in pregnancy.

124
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,160
They also looked at some, you know, they
also adjusted for all of these other

125
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,370
factors so just to practice interpreting
Cox regression results something that

126
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,870
was a pretty good predictor is if you'd
had a major depressive episode in

127
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,300
the six months before pregnancy, it was
almost a threefold increase in risk of

128
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,450
depression during pregnancy, major
depressive episode during pregnancy.

129
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,770
After adjustment, that got attenuated, but
it was still elevated.

130
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:51,640
An 84% higher rate or risk of having a
major depressive episode during pregnancy.

131
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,820
There was some elevation in risk if you'd
had a lot,

132
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,440
larger number of depressive episodes
before pregnancy.

133
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,680
Looked like, if your age at your first
depressive episode was below 14.

134
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,960
With some elevation of risk,

135
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,060
although again that went away in the
adjusted model.

136
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,300
The races other than white appear to have
an elevated risk.

137
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,920
And this is one of the few cases where
being young seems to be worse and

138
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,820
being old seems to be protective.

139
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,190
So if you look at age, at least in the
un-adjusted models,

140
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,880
the younger women had a higher risk.

141
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,410
Of course when you adjust for things that
gets attenuated as closer to one.

142
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,780
Still a trend towards the older women
having a little protection there.

143
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,670
Education in the adjusted models doesn't
look all that interesting.

144
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,370
Diabetes looks a little bit interesting,

145
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,710
although the confidence intervals are
wide.

146
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,004
Probably not a lot of women have diabetes
at, in this age group.

147
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:41,396
So, that's just some practice in
interpreting the results of

148
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:44,235
Cox regression with time-dependent
predictors.

149
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:49,330
