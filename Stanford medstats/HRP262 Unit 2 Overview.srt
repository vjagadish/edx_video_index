00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,440
Welcome to week two of HRP 262.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,340
This week, I'm going to introduce you to
the parametric regression methods for

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,750
analyzing survival data.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,900
So last week, we talked about basically
descriptive methods for

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,480
looking at survival data.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,070
This week, we're going to delve into
regression.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,790
We're going to start by talking about the
parametric regression models,

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,170
which are those that assume some kind of
underlying mathematical function for

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,410
the survival times.

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,680
We're specifically going to talk about
exponential and Weibull survival models.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,050
Because we are delving into fitting
mathematical Curves,

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,800
smooth mathematical curves.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,000
We will have a bit of math this week.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,570
Especially the first three units we'll
talk about probability distributions,

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,470
hazard functions and survival functions.

16
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,690
So there will be some math thrown in
there.

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,100
So where are we on our little statistical
chart of tasks for time-to-event outcomes.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,795
Again, we cover some of the descriptive
methods last week, incidence rates,

19
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:04,390
Kaplan-Meier statistics.

20
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,590
This week we're delving into our first
regression technique for survival data.

21
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,060
Specifically, the parametric regression
technique.

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,180
Just to give you a flavor for

23
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,230
what I mean by this, so, here are two
survival curves pictured on this slide.

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,440
On the left side is the non-parametric
estimate of survival function.

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,200
We, calculated this last week.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,940
This was some pregnancy data.

27
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,250
Women getting pregnant.

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,620
We calculated the Kaplan Meier curve.

29
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,770
This is the observed survival function,
just what we saw in our data.

30
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,130
That's what you're seeing on the left hand
side of the slide.

31
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,830
On the right hand side of the slide,

32
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,180
what you're seeing is the result of
parametric regression model.

33
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,757
So what we have done is estimated that
survival curve now as

34
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:47,100
a smooth mathematical function.

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,600
And that's the idea of parametric
regression.
