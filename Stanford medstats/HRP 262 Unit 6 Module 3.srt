00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,830
In this next module,

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,100
I'm going to give you some introductory
examples to repeated measures data.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,980
Just to give you some examples from the
literature of the kinds of

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,930
things that we're talking about when we're
talking about repeated measures outcomes.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,390
So here's an example that was in the
British Medical Journal a number of

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,230
years ago.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,880
This was looking at comparing homeopathy
versus a placebo pill in

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,550
treating pain after surgery.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,230
And the homeopathy group is in the filled
in circles,

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,900
the placebo group is in the open circles,
and you can see just by looking at

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,720
this visual that homeopathy really doesn't
do so well in terms of treating pain.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,450
It doesn't do anything better than a
placebo at least.

14
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,840
The outcome here is a continuous outcome
which is your mean pain scores,

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,920
assessed by this visual analog scale.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,985
You basically, you ask people to rate
their pain on a scale from

17
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:59,800
zero to something, and you can see that
right after surgery they

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,180
are probably on the sedatives and the
drugs from surgery.

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,510
So as they come off of those their pain
slowly goes up,

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,360
then they start this homeopathy or placebo
but the pain goes up and

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,410
the homeopathy group doesn't really do any
better than the placebo group.

22
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,832
Yeah, and what you can see though is that
pain was measured multiple times over

23
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:22,630
the course of after surgery, so these are
hours after surgery.

24
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,840
So every hour after surgery the
researchers here

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,800
were measuring this pain on this visual
analog scale.

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,090
And they've plotted it here and the plot
tells you a lot of information,

27
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,320
because clearly you can see there's not
much difference between the groups.

28
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,534
So this would be a type of repeated
measured outcomes,

29
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:39,870
it's the same people having their pain
measured over time.

30
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:48,820
Just another example, this was a study
comparing a antidepressant divalproex,

31
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,250
to a placebo pill for the treatment of
depression.

32
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,150
And so what we're seeing is the mean
change in the depression score, so

33
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,700
you want to go down because these are
people with depression, they want,

34
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,390
you want to lower their depression scores.

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,100
What you can see that's interesting they
measured the depression scores at

36
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,200
multiple time points, after randomization,
after they started taking the pills.

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,012
And you can see,

38
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:14,014
you can see a clear placebo effect because
the placebo group, that's the group in

39
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:18,340
red actually does have quite a drop in
their depression scores initially.

40
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,080
So reflecting some kind of placebo effect
that

41
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,840
they think that they're getting something
that will help.

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,110
But then it sort of plateaus out and

43
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,070
you can see there's an additional drop in
the the antidepressant group here.

44
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,890
This does turn out to be statistically
significant by something

45
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,750
called repeating measures.

46
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,380
So NOVO which we'll talk about next week.

47
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,000
But again another example of they've
measured depression scores at

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,200
multiple time points, on the same people.

49
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,230
You're starting to get the idea here, just
a few more examples, so

50
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,560
this one was looking at acute mountain
sickness,

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,440
it was treated with something called a
simulated descent.

52
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,980
One hour of treatment in a hyperbaric
chamber.

53
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,490
Or a kind of a steroid.

54
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,230
And so you can see that the steroid group
is in the open circles.

55
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,000
This pressurization group is in the closed
circles.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,100
They are measuring their mean score on
some kind of measure of mountain sickness.

57
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,240
If, again, a continuous measure, and

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,550
you can see that they're both going down
over time.

59
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,660
It looks like the pressurization maybe has
a quicker resolution of the acute

60
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,920
mountain sickness.

61
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,850
So another example of multiple
measurements on the same groups of people.

62
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,980
Another one, so we're going to be talking
about milk and calcium in bone density.

63
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,620
This was a randomized trial, where they,
women at adolescence were randomized to

64
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,930
drink a pint of milk extra a day versus
being in a control group.

65
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,390
And they followed their total bone mineral
content,

66
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,220
this is the total amount of calcium in
your skeleton over time.

67
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,400
And the milk and calcium intake does
matter for adolescents.

68
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,400
So you can see that there's a small
separation between these groups.

69
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,260
This is graphing the percentage increase
in his bone mineral content over time.

70
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,100
And you can see it's not a huge difference
between the groups, but

71
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,450
definitely getting some advantage if
you're drinking that extra milk.

72
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,840
And finally one more, so this is looking
another randomized trial looking at

73
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,730
counseling and smoking in pregnancy.

74
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,340
This is the number of cigarettes smoked
per week so another continuous outcome.

75
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,820
We have the counseling group in red and
the control group in blue.

76
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,500
So the counseling group is doing somewhat
better on reducing their

77
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,250
cigarette intake during pregnancy than the
control group.

78
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,286
But again, we're measuring, [UNKNOWN] it's
number of cigarettes per week,

79
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:21,120
that continuous outcome multiple, at
multiple time points.

80
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,905
You can see that graphing these types of
data is going to be very important,

81
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:27,280
because it really gives you a lot of
insight into what's happening in the data.

82
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,369
