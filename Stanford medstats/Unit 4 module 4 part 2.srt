1
00:00:00,603 --> 00:00:04,841
So, we also write the binomial.

2
00:00:04,841 --> 00:00:07,319
If I want to shorthand the binomial, I
will write X,

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,770
and this little tilda means is distributed
as a binomial with parameters n and p.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,006
So every binomial distribution is defined
by two parameters,

5
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:17,921
the number of trials and the probability
of it's success.

6
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:20,921
And sometimes in shorthand I'll write x
tilda Binomial, and

7
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:25,769
this just my short hand way of saying X is
distributed as a binomial.

8
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,709
Again, the probability that they're
exactly X successes,

9
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:32,596
is when you have a binomial is this parti,
this formula.

10
00:00:32,596 --> 00:00:35,707
N choose X, P raised to X, 1 minus P
raised to N minus X.

11
00:00:35,707 --> 00:00:38,829
So lets use this now, and solve some
problems.

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,580
So I want to return now to the problem
that I set out,

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,430
one of the problems I set out in the
teaser.

14
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,430
It turns out that this is a binomial
problem, and

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,290
the hardest thing about getting binomial
problems right,

16
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,190
is just recognizing when you're on a
binomial distribution.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,694
Applying the formula is really trivial,
and most days times now,

18
00:00:59,694 --> 00:01:03,010
are days you can just you know do
calculate things on the computer.

19
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,750
The key to getting, to doing well here, is
to be

20
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,580
able to recognize when a problem fits into
a binomial distribution, as this one does.

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,282
So, here was the problem.

22
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:18,010
We had a new anti aging treatment, and we
wanted to test if it did anything.

23
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,530
So let's say we treat ten patients with
wrinkles,

24
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,220
with this new anti-aging treatment.

25
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,050
There's no control group or

26
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,300
anything, it's a limited study here, but
just a very simple study.

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,980
The ten patients are photographed before
their treatment and after.

28
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,810
Those pairs of photographs are given to a
blinded independent dermatologist, and

29
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,110
he or she is asked to distinguish the pre
and the post photographs.

30
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,350
The idea being that you call the one with
less wrinkles the pre-photograph, and

31
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,450
the one, or sorry.

32
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,660
The one with more wrinkles the
pre-photograph, and

33
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,140
the one with less wrinkles after the anti
treat, aging treatment the post.

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,640
So if the, if the dermatologist can get
that right,

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,720
that means that the dermatologist sees a
visible change in wrinkles, and

36
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,200
is able to say that there are fewer
wrinkles after in the post period.

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,940
Now, let's say that you do this
experiment.

38
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,420
And your independent dermatologist
actually arranges the pre and

39
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,090
post photographs correctly for nine out of
the ten subjects.

40
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,170
Well, you might think, you know, that's
some evidence.

41
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,450
They're able to get nine right.

42
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,640
There's, that's some evidence that the
anti-aging treatment is doing something.

43
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,950
On the other hand, you also might look at
those data and say.

44
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,040
Well, but, you know, if the dermatologist
was just guessing,

45
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,910
they could just guess their way to getting
five of those right.

46
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,480
Right?

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,990
It would be easy to just guess and to get
five correct.

48
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,750
So is nine really that much better or are
they,

49
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,450
just is that, just is that lucky guessing?

50
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,970
So we want to answer the question.

51
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,920
We want to set the problem up in the
following way.

52
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,470
We want to say, well lets assume that the
anti-aging treatment doesn't do anything,

53
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,420
it's completely ineffective.

54
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,550
What's the probability that the
dermatologist could of

55
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,060
gotten at least nine right, purely by
lucky guessing.

56
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,930
And getting ten right would be even
better.

57
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,230
So, we're going to say, at least nine.

58
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,480
If they get nine or

59
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,210
ten right, is that evidence that the
anti-aging treatment works?

60
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,390
Or, is it [COUGH] that it's just, one
could easily get nine or

61
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,170
ten right, just by guessing?

62
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,970
Is it probable or is it improbable?

63
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,620
So, let's take, calculate the probability
that purely by guessing,

64
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,305
the dermatologists could have gotten at
least nine right.

65
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:22,130
Well, this is a binomial problem.

66
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,330
Right?
It's a binomial with an n of 10, and

67
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,580
again assuming that the anti-aging
treatment doesn't do anything,

68
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,589
we're going to start with that assumption,

69
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:37,490
the probability of correctly ordering the
photographs then is 0.5.

70
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,530
So, if there's 10 patients, probability of
0.5,

71
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,400
we're on a binomial with an n or 10 and p
of 0.5.

72
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,630
And we want to know what's the chance of
getting at least 9.

73
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,380
Our outcome is getting at least 9 of those
ordered correctly,

74
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,790
that means either 9 or 10.

75
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,280
So again we're on a binomial now.

76
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,730
We have to recognize this is a binomial,
which is the tricky part of this problem.

77
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,563
We're on a binomial where we have 10
trials, 10 patients.

78
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:05,510
And each time the dermatologist looks at a
patient, for

79
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,560
each of those patients, they're going to,

80
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,980
that dermatologist is going to try to
order the photos correctly.

81
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,280
If the anti aging treatment is really
ineffective,

82
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,740
they have a 0.5 chance of getting it
right.

83
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,130
Purely guessing.

84
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,440
So what's the probability that, by purely
guessing, they could get nine or

85
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,490
even do better and get ten right?

86
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,190
Well, we have to calculate the probability
of getting exactly nine right,

87
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,080
plus the probability of getting exactly
ten right.

88
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,140
When we calculate these types of
probabilities we always calculate all the,

89
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,640
we always think of the, the probabilities
in the tail, in the full tail.

90
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,279
Because sometimes there's many, many, many
possibilities in any

91
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,780
particular probability, may not have a big
probability.

92
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,540
So we always take, calculate the
probability of what we observed, and

93
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,630
anything more extreme.

94
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,030
In, in other words, the entire tail.

95
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,230
So, we're going to calculate the
probability that X equals 9, and

96
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,560
the probability that X equals 10.

97
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,605
Well, we can just apply the binomial
formula.

98
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:56,950
So, the probability that X is going to
equal exactly 9,

99
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,142
which is what actually happened in the
study, would be 10, choose 9,

100
00:05:00,142 --> 00:05:05,791
0.5 raised to 9, and 1 minus 0.5, which is
of course just 0.5, raised to 1.

101
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,762
The probability of getting exactly 10
right,

102
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:15,640
is 10 choose 10 0.5 raised to 10, and then
0.5 raised to 0 of course just 1.

103
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,230
Well we can do out the choosing function
just for practice.

104
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,990
So 10 choose 9 is 10 factorial divided by
9 factorial times 1 factorial.

105
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,347
That's just equal to 10, if you solve it
out.

106
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:26,830
10 choose 10 is just equal to 1.

107
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,210
10 factorial divided by 10 factorial.

108
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,480
So we can calculate this out, and

109
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,950
the total probability here turns out to be
1.1%.

110
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,080
So, if the anti-aging treatment did
nothing, that dermatologist would've only

111
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,930
have a 1.1% chance of guessing of getting
at least 9 right.

112
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,710
And so that's pretty low, so

113
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,300
we might then believe that the anti-aging
treatment is actually doing something.

114
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,470
And this is our introduction to the
calculation of a P value,

115
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,330
which we will start talking about next
week.

116
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,520
But I just want to show you here,

117
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,360
I actually did out all the possible
outcomes, all the probabilities for all

118
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,750
the possible outcomes here, just to show
you the full binomial distribution here.

119
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,620
What are your, what are more of the
possible outcomes.

120
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,240
Well, the dermatologist could've gotten
zero right.

121
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,900
In fact, if he got, if he or

122
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,730
she got zero right, this means that he
miss ordered all of them.

123
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,460
So that in other words, all of them were
put post first and pre second.

124
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,310
That would suggest that the anti-aging
treatment actually had

125
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,510
a negative effect on wrinkles, increased
wrinkles.

126
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,900
You can get anywhere from zero all the way
up to ten orderings correct,

127
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,020
five is the most common if you're just
guessing.

128
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,410
Then I took the br, binomial
probabilities, and

129
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,890
I calculated the probabilities of each one
of those outcomes.

130
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,430
And notice that if you add those up,

131
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,135
they do indeed sum up to one, because one
of those outcomes has to occur.

132
00:06:46,135 --> 00:06:49,400
Another practice problem.

133
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,580
Let's say you're conducting a case control
study of smoking and lung cancer.

134
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,990
And the probability that a particular lung
cancer case is a smoker, is 0.6.

135
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,800
You have a group of eight cases.

136
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,464
I want to know, this is a binomial
probability distribution,

137
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:09,080
because each case has the same
probability, 0.6 of being a smoker.

138
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,740
So I want to ask, what's the probability
that in that group of eight cases,

139
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,170
you end up with less than two smokers?

140
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,100
What's the probability that you end up
with more than five?

141
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,190
And notice now I'm asking to give the
probability not for

142
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,540
an exact number, but for a range of
values.

143
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,950
That means that you're going to have to
calculate multiple binomial probabilities.

144
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,870
So to calculate the probability of less
than two,

145
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,020
you have to calculate the probability of
zero, and the probability of one.

146
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,880
To calculate more than five, you have to
calculate the probability of six and

147
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,750
seven, and eight.

148
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,650
You can see that doing that binomial
probabilities is a little bit tedious.

149
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,890
For the most part,

150
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:48,220
you'll eventually be able to do this on a
computer or you can, it turns out there's

151
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,220
a way to approximate binomials that we're
going to learn in a future module.

152
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,990
But let's do this out here.

153
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,760
I actually did out the entire probability
distribution.

154
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,370
Just to remind you that, you know,

155
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,620
there's all these different possible
outcomes here.

156
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,120
There's nine different possible outcomes.

157
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,620
And we can calcu, calculate the exact
probability of each different outcome.

158
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,640
If we add those probabilities all up, they
add up to one.

159
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,140
So, I've just calculated, I've applied the
binomial probability formula here,

160
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,840
to calculate the probability of all
possible outcomes here.

161
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,439
If you sum those up they add up to one.

162
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,050
So, what's the probability of getting less
than two smokers?

163
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,350
That's the probability of getting either 0
or 1, so

164
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,850
we add those two probabilities up.

165
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:31,480
So, from the chart on the previous page is
was 0.0065 plus 0.008, that

166
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,460
turned out to be a probability of 0.865%,
that we would get less than two smokers.

167
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,600
The probability of getting more than five
smokers is equal to the probability of

168
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,106
getting six, plus the probability of
getting seven,

169
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:43,780
plus the probability of getting eight.

170
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:50,400
When you add those up, you get 31.68%.

171
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,100
Now, all probability distributions have an
expected value and a variance, and

172
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,770
the binomial distribution does as well.

173
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,270
The expected value is actually pretty easy
to reason out.

174
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,850
Like if I said you flip a coin 100 times,
what,

175
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,530
what's the number of heads that you'd
expect to get?

176
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,050
Everybody will say 50 heads.

177
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,336
You don't know why you're saying that,
you're just kind of well, you know,

178
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:16,780
100 coin flips, 50% chance of heads, or

179
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,810
I'm multiplying those together I should
get 50 heads.

180
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,130
So that is the expected value of a
binomial.

181
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,740
You actually are just multiplying n times
p.

182
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,210
And I think makes good Intuitive sense.

183
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,850
So the expected value just turns out to be
n times p, and

184
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,480
I think everybody intuitively will buy
that.

185
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,980
Now, the variance is a little bit less
straight forward, but

186
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:41,060
it turns out that the variance of a
binomial is n times p times 1 minus p.

187
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,230
For those of you who would like the proof
of that,

188
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,690
I'm going to offer that as an optional
module in a few minutes.

189
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,390
For those of you who are less interested
in this,

190
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,190
a little bit of an algebraic proof.

191
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,070
I'm going to try to get you to believe
this,

192
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,310
just by showing you some computer
simulation in a minute.

193
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,540
Of course, if the variance is n times p
times 1 minus p,

194
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,593
the standard deviation is the square root
of that.

195
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:07,725
Now, this n times p times 1 minus p, I
think, is just an interesting quantity.

196
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:12,810
Because, it has, it's a bounded quantity,
p times 1 minus p,

197
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,250
can only get so big, and I think it's a
just worth pointing that out.

198
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,895
So, if you think of p, p is a number
between zero and one it's a probability.

199
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:23,906
P times 1 minus p is then a function of p,
and

200
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:30,700
that function p times 1 minus p has a
maximum point.

201
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,960
It occurs when p, is equal to 0.5.

202
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,310
So, these will get bigger and bigger, p
times 1 minus p, will get bigger and

203
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,700
bigger, until, and it will peak at where p
is equal to 0.5.

204
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
So you're going to have the most
variability,

205
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,620
in a binomial when p is equal 0.5.

206
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,060
One fifty, we have fifty, fifty chance.

207
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,940
This occurs of course 0.5 times 0.5 is
2.5.

208
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,280
This occurs, the biggest value you can
have is a quarter.

209
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,240
Where p is 0.5, then p times 1 minus p
will be 0.25.

210
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,990
So that means that the variance of any
binomial, has to be either equal to or

211
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,860
less than n times a quarter.

212
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,930
So, a quarter of n is the maximum variance
any particular binomial can have.

213
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,620
So if you're working with a binomial where
you've got a probability of success that's

214
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,310
pretty close to 0.5, and you want to just
kind of estimate the variance,

215
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,630
you could just multiply n times a quarter
to get a quick estimate of the variance.

216
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,480
How would we use this?

217
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,600
Why is it useful to know the expected
value and variance of a binomial?

218
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,515
Well, it turns out to be very useful to be
able to, to know those.

219
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:32,930
because now, you can say what the
expected, if you know you're on

220
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,570
a binomial problem, you can easily
calculate the expected value.

221
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,400
And you can easily put a margin of error
around that expected value,

222
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,320
because you know the variance.

223
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,140
So just to apply this expected value and
variance concept,

224
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:53,040
let's take the problem where you have a
coin in that your going to flip 100 times.

225
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,490
If I asked you, what's the expected value
of the variance and

226
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,010
the standard deviation for the number of
heads.

227
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,800
Again, I think everybody would agree,

228
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,000
without knowing anything about binomials,
that the expected value here should be 50.

229
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,860
And indeed if we see this as a binomial
with a n of 100 and a p of 0.5,

230
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,579
if I multiply 100 times 0.5 I get 50.

231
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:15,380
So expected value's easy, what about the
variance and standard deviation?

232
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,220
So the expected value is n times p equals
fif, 50.

233
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:25,750
The variance is n times p times 1 minus p,
so that would be 100 times 0.5 times 0.5.

234
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,990
That comes out to be 25.

235
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:32,150
Remember I told you, that the cap on
variance for a binomial is a quarter of n,

236
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:36,790
and that occurs the the biggest, when the
maximum occurs when you p is 0.5, so

237
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,750
the variance here turns out to be exactly
a quarter of n.

238
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,240
If the variance is 25,

239
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,390
the standard deviation is the square root
of that, or 5.

240
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,560
So what does this tell us?

241
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,390
How is this helpful or useful.

242
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,660
Well this tells you that if you flip a
coin a 100 times,

243
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,510
your expecting to get about 50 heads.

244
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,970
But of course we know that we're not going
to get exactly 50 heads every time.

245
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,800
We could easily get 49, 48, 51,

246
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,960
it's not going to be exactly heads because
there's some random chance going on here.

247
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,000
So what this standard deviation tells us,
is that we're expecting to

248
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,030
get about 50 heads, and the standard
deviation's a sort of a margin of error.

249
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:15,670
We're expecting to get about 50 heads plus
or minus 5.

250
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,675
And so it would be totally reasonable that
you could get 45 heads all the way up to

251
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:26,890
55 heads, and even you could even go down
to 40, and all the way up to 60.

252
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,350
Those are all reasonable outcomes, given
the variability here.

253
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,020
Things that get much smaller or

254
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,380
much bigger than that, turn out to be
improbable.

255
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,470
So because the standard deviation here is
5,

256
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,440
we're expecting on average to be 5 away
from 50.

257
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,770
Now I told you that if you didn't want to
see the proof for

258
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:49,560
the variance of the binomial, I would try
to motivate that

259
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,800
n times p times 1 minus p is correct, by
showing you computer simulation.

260
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,220
And we're going to start doing a lot
computer simulations next week.

261
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,540
So this coin problem is just a nice
problem to start with,

262
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,330
to illustrate the concept of a computer
simulation.

263
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,030
So, what all computer simulation means,

264
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:13,488
is that I can have the computer flip coins
virtually.

265
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:18,045
And I can have the computer figure out the
expected value and

266
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:21,370
variants, simply by flipping a lot of
virtual coins.

267
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,240
So, this is the logic behind it.

268
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,230
I would tell the computer to flip a
virtual coin 100 times and

269
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,220
count up the number of heads.

270
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,720
That would give me one trial, one answer
to the binomial.

271
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,250
But then I would do that many, many, many,
many times.

272
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,890
Have the computer do that many, many,

273
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,468
many, many times and record all the
results.

274
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:41,700
The idea is that by doing it many, many,

275
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,302
many times, I'm going to see how
frequently different outcomes occur.

276
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,640
How frequently do I get 40 heads?

277
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,170
How frequently does, do I get 41 heads?

278
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,790
How frequently do I get 70 heads?

279
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,070
Do I even ever get 70 heads?

280
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,300
So I have the computer repeat this over
and over and

281
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,450
over again, an arbitrarily large number of
times.

282
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,622
And I'm going to, I'm going to try 30,000
times.

283
00:15:02,622 --> 00:15:03,490
Why 30,000?

284
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,720
It's totally arbitrary.

285
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,200
I just know that 30,000 is a pretty large
number, but it's not so

286
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,788
large that it freezes my computer.

287
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:13,800
So, I'm going to have my computer do this
30,000 times, and

288
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,460
I'm going to plot the results in a
histogram.

289
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,220
And here's the results.

290
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,670
So here's what happens when I have the
computer flip 100 coins, 30,000 times.

291
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,330
And every time it flips 100 coins, it
counts up the number of heads.

292
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,930
So what you notice is that the, the most
common outcome was an outcome of 50,

293
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,290
exactly what we expect.

294
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,600
That occurred, though, less than 2500
times.

295
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,560
Because you easily, you could easily get
49 heads, a lot of times we got 51 heads.

296
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,548
And you can see as you get down towards
67, 68 and down towards 33,

297
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:44,650
32, it's peters off.

298
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:51,430
Out of 30,000 times,

299
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,780
we never got thing, values that big.

300
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,490
So, that tells you that those values occur
very infrequently, and

301
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,080
they're very in, unlikely.

302
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,330
If you just look at this graphic, if you
look at the,

303
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,120
all the different outcomes here; the mean
is 50 as expected.

304
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,820
The standard deviation for

305
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,860
this data set of 30,000 observations,
turns out to be exactly five.

306
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,890
Exactly what the formula predicted.

307
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,820
The other really interesting thing to
notice here,

308
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,570
is that it makes a perfect normal
distribution.

309
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,520
So even though we're talking about a
binomial distribution,

310
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,290
which is a discrete distribution, it turns
out that in

311
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,300
many cases the binomial distribution ends
up looking like a normal.

312
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,370
And in a few modules we're going to see
that we often approximated a binomial as

313
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,940
a normal for that reason.

314
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,460
The other thing to notice, is because
we're on a normal distribution,

315
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,160
it's actually pretty much a perfect normal
distribution, 95% of

316
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,810
the observations are expected to fall
between two standard deviations below,

317
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,040
all the way up to 2 standard deviations
above the mean.

318
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,220
And indeed, 95% of these observations fell
between 40 heads, and

319
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,340
60 has two standard deviations below to
above the mean.

320
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,138
So it really is on a perfect normal curve.

321
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:04,130
And this technique again of computer
simulation,

322
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,430
is going to be very useful in the up
coming weeks of this course.
