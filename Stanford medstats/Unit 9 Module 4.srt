1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,510
In this next module, we're going to talk
about the concept of interaction.

2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,400
I mentioned it briefly in an earlier week
in this course, but

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,820
now w'ere going to really delve into the
concept and

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,169
I'm going to show you how to test for
interaction in a regression model.

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,695
First of all, what is interaction?

6
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:29,950
Interaction is when the effect size
differs significantly between

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,180
different subgroups.

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,300
In other words, the relationship between a
treatment and

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,520
an outcome might differ depending on say
whether you are a man or

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,440
a woman, or some other subgroup
characteristic.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,190
For example, if you've got a blood
pressure treatment that

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,260
works significantly better in men than
women, that's interaction.

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,590
That would mean that the effect size for

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,540
the blood pressure treatment was
significantly bigger in men than in women.

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,800
Another term you'll sometimes hear used is
effect modification.

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,100
Effect modification and interaction mean
the same thing.

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:08,156
You could say that the effect of the blood
pressure treatment was modified by gender,

18
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:13,258
or you could say that the treatment and
gender interact, either one is fine.

19
00:01:13,258 --> 00:01:16,784
How do we test for interaction in a
regression model?

20
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:17,768
So, the test for

21
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:23,210
interaction in a regression model, you can
add an interaction term to that model.

22
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,610
And I'll show you what that is in a
minute.

23
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,800
If that interaction term is statistically
significant, that indicates,

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,631
that's proof of interaction.

25
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:33,953
Let's use this little blood pressure
example.

26
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:39,830
If I want to test for interaction between
gender and this blood pressure treatment.

27
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,260
Blood pressure is a continuous outcome
variable, so

28
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,420
I'm going to be running a linear
regression here.

29
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:50,800
I'm going to include in my model a beta
for treatment, and a beta for gender.

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,450
And I'm also going to include a term for

31
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,620
the interaction between gender and
treatment.

32
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,056
And what that is, it's literally I'm
going to multiple the value for

33
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:01,713
gender times the value for treatment.

34
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:05,065
So, let me illustrate that by writing out
a little mock data set.

35
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:07,440
You've got some variable gender.

36
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,590
In this case, I've coded it that one is
male and zero is female.

37
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,230
I've got another variable that's
treatment.

38
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,860
One means you're on the drug, 0 means are
on placebo.

39
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,930
Then I've got ID numbers, let's call them
1, 2 and 3.

40
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,240
So, let's say the first person here was a
male and

41
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,930
they were on the placebo, they will get
the values 1 for gender 0 for treatment.

42
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,900
Then we've got a female who was on the
treatment, that would be 0,1.

43
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,330
And then let's say we have a male who's on
the treatment, that's a 1, 1.

44
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,100
If you multiply those values together,
that is what an interaction is.

45
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,350
It's gender times treatment.

46
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,330
because literally we're going to multiply
the values of

47
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,510
those two variables together.

48
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,864
So, ID number one get's a value of 1 times
a value of 0,

49
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:50,630
that's going to give them an interaction
term of zero.

50
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,830
The ID number two gender is 0, treatment
is 1, 0 times 1 is 0.

51
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,381
ID number three, 1 times 1 is 1.

52
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:01,520
Notice that if you've got two binary
predictors,

53
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,830
a 0,1 variable, and another 0,1 variable.

54
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,130
The only people who are going to get a 1
for

55
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,520
the interaction are the people who have a
1 on both of those binary variables.

56
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,190
So, in this case, only people who both are
male and

57
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,200
got the drug will get a value of 1.

58
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,790
Everybody else gets a value of 0 for that
Interaction.

59
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,120
That's the, the data, the variables that
were then including in the model.

60
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,320
If the beta for the interaction comes out
to be statistically significant,

61
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,240
this would indicate that there's a
significant interaction.

62
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,200
And the way you would interpret the beta's
from the model, the beta for

63
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,880
treatment in this case, because women is
the reference group, the beta for

64
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,817
treatment represents the treatment effect
in the women.

65
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:45,920
The beta, the treatment effect for the
men,

66
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,934
you get by adding the treatment effect,
the beta for

67
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:58,240
treatment plus the date for interaction.

68
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,060
So men, their treatment effect is beta
treatment plus beta interaction.

69
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,670
In other words, the interaction term
represents the difference in

70
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,280
the treatment effect between the men and
the women.

71
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,980
So, if that's significantly different,

72
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,920
that indicates a significant difference in
those effect sizes.

73
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,230
Just in, as a side note here, there is
also a beta gender here.

74
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,820
This term will just indicate whether or
not there was a main effect for gender.

75
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,670
That is whether or

76
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:33,500
not males have higher blood pressure than
females, unrelated to the treatment.

77
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,990
So, that's what a model within an
interaction term looks like.

78
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,720
Now, let's visit some real examples of how
to apply this in the medical literature.

79
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,714
We saw this smoking cessation trial in an
earlier week.

80
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:48,374
In this trial, we had women smokers who
were concerned about their weight.

81
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:51,790
They were afraid to quit, because they
were afraid of gaining weight.

82
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,755
These women were randomly assigned to one
of four groups, so they were randomly

83
00:04:55,755 --> 00:05:00,180
assigned to either get weight focused
counseling or to get standard counseling.

84
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,271
And they were randomly assigned to get a
drug, an anti-smoking drug,

85
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,650
bupropion, or to get a placebo.

86
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,850
So that makes up four total groups.

87
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,640
The outcome here was smoking abstinence.

88
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,260
It was biochemically confirmed.

89
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,880
It's a binary outcome: you either were
abstinent or you weren't.

90
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,630
So that means we're going to be

91
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,499
using logistic regression to analyze the
the data.

92
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:24,300
Here's the result to that study.

93
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,301
It's a rather busy table, so I'm going to
zoom in on some things now.

94
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:33,094
First of all, we're looking at actually
three different outcomes here.

95
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:38,103
They measured the abstinence rates at 3
months, 6 months and

96
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:39,230
12 months into the study.

97
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,240
So, each of those rows represent a
different time point in this study.

98
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,540
If you just look at the placebo groups
within each of those counseling groups,

99
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,700
you'll see that the rates of abstinence
are pretty similar.

100
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,021
So, at 3 months, it was 18%, where where
in the placebo group.

101
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,750
In the weight focused counseling group,

102
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,600
we're abstinent versus 19%, in the placebo
group in the other counseling group.

103
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,490
Those rates look very similar, so what we
would say here is that there

104
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,100
doesn't appear to be a main effect for
counseling.

105
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,770
In the placebo groups,

106
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:15,110
those quitting rates in the two counseling
groups look pretty much the same.

107
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,540
What about an effect for drug?

108
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,290
So if we compare the placebo group to the
drug group within each of

109
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,560
those two counseling types, what do we
see?

110
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,590
It appears that the drug actually does
improve quitting rates in both groups.

111
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,130
So, if I look at the weight focused
counseling group, if you're in the placebo

112
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,164
group the quitting rate was 18% at 3
months versus in the drug group and

113
00:06:35,164 --> 00:06:36,408
it was 41%.

114
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:39,310
At 6 months you also see a similar a
pretty big increase.

115
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,820
In the standard counseling group, the drug
also appears to have an effect.

116
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:48,440
The effect isn't quite as big, but

117
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,450
you do see almost a doubling of the
quitting rates if you add the drug.

118
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,350
So, for example, in the placebo group at
three months, the quitting rate was 19%.

119
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,240
That went to 33% in the drug group.

120
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,415
At 6 months, it went from 10% to 21%, so
there's a pretty big increase.

121
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:07,870
Basically, a doubling of quitting rates in
the drug group,

122
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,660
even within the standard counseling group.

123
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,840
Now, as we talked about in the earlier
module on this example,

124
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,110
the P-value is highly significant for the
weight focus counseling group,

125
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,490
the P value of comparing placebo and drug
within that group.

126
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,510
It didn't quite make statistical
significance within the standard

127
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,829
counseling group, but it's very close to
that.

128
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,890
What we would conclude is there just
appears to be a main effect for drug.

129
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,700
Overall, drug seems to be doing something.

130
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,090
Even though it didn't quite reach
statistical significance in

131
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,190
the standard counseling group.

132
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,863
We talked about not misinterpreting those
p values in an earlier module.

133
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:43,964
If you look at the,

134
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:48,300
what the authors' concluded in the media
coverage of this study.

135
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,870
Here's the basic conclusion that was
drawn.

136
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:55,260
Among weight concerned women smokers, drug
therapy increased cessation rates

137
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,920
when added to a specialized weight
concerns intervention,

138
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,760
the weight counseling, but not when added
to standard counseling.

139
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,380
The implication there is that there is an
interaction,

140
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,400
they're saying that the drugs works in one
group, but not the other.

141
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,570
They're implying that there is an
interaction between drug and

142
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,250
counseling type.

143
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:19,430
However, they haven't done any formal
analyses to test for an interaction here.

144
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,650
So, there is, they haven't specifically
talked about interaction but

145
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,770
that's really the implication here, and
they haven't formally tested that.

146
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,105
So, I actually took the data in their
paper and

147
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:32,010
re-entered in the logistic regression to
test for interaction to see whether or

148
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,640
not there really is an interaction.

149
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,130
And what would it mean if there was an
interaction?

150
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,510
So, just go back to this slide for a
minute.

151
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,635
An interaction would mean that the drug
affect, the difference between, you know,

152
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:44,790
going from here to here.

153
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,490
The difference between placebo and drug
was much bigger in

154
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,360
the weight-focused counseling group than
in the standard counseling group.

155
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,490
It does appear to be somewhat bigger.

156
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:56,994
The, the, change from placebo to drug
appears to be somewhat bigger in

157
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,279
the weight-focused counseling group, but

158
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,260
not a lot bigger than in the standard
counseling group.

159
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,800
We can formulate tasks whether that effect
size is bigger.

160
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,249
We can run a logistic regression within an
interaction term.

161
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,140
Here's the logistic regression model.

162
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,629
Our outcome is smoking abstinence.

163
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:16,869
I'm going to put in the model a main
effect for drug, a main effect for

164
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:21,936
counseling type and an interaction between
drug and counseling type.

165
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,960
And these are all binary variables.

166
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,096
When I run that model using the data that
was available in the paper,

167
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:31,076
I find a significant effect for a drug.

168
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:33,533
There's a significant mean effect for a
drug.

169
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,420
I find nothing for counseling.

170
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,567
In fact, the counseling, the beta for

171
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:38,871
counseling does not come out statistically
significant.

172
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:42,901
And the interaction between drug and
counseling type also does not come out to

173
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:46,545
be anywhere near statistically
significant.

174
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,490
Indicating that we can't say that there's
a difference in how that

175
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,250
drug works in those two groups.

176
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,770
And here, I'm just showing you the p
values for

177
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,460
interaction from those models I ran.

178
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,760
I ran three logistic regression models for
each of the time points.

179
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,890
And in none of the cases does the P-value
even approach statistical significance.

180
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,656
So, we have no evidence that the effect of
the drug differs by counseling type.

181
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:10,151
Our main conclusion, then.

182
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:14,993
Our correct take home message would be
that the drug improves quitting rates over

183
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:16,860
counseling alone, period.

184
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,300
There's a main effect for a drug, there's
no main effect for

185
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,002
counseling type and there's no interaction
between drug, and counseling type.

186
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:26,870
It's not statistically significant, at
least, that we don't have evidence that

187
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:34,060
the drug behaves differently in those two
groups, at least not from this study.

188
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,790
The second example I'm going to show you
is a cross-sectional study of

189
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,720
about 1700 men and women.

190
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,380
In this study, they actually did formally
test for

191
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,210
interaction and they did find a
significant interaction.

192
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,970
This study was looking at the relationship
between sleep duration and

193
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,980
sleep problems, and hypertension.

194
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,890
It's a cross-sectional study but

195
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,560
they treated hypertension as the outcome
variable.

196
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,260
Hypertension is binary, yes, no.

197
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,984
So, we're going to be using, they did use,
logistic regression.

198
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:04,371
Let me show you the main results of that
study.

199
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:08,020
This charts a little complicated, so I'm
kind of going to walk you through it.

200
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,040
And I want to actually also write out the
logistic regression model that

201
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,830
was used here.

202
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,220
I think it's, it's a little complicated,
but it's instructive.

203
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,650
So, first of all what are we looking at?

204
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,280
The outcome here is hypertension.

205
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,345
So, we're looking at odds ratios for
hypertension,

206
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:27,630
based on two predictor variables: sleep
difficulty and sleep duration.

207
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,160
If you read the fine print, I just want to
note here that there's other things in

208
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,110
the model between, besides those two
predictors.

209
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,250
This is all data were adjusted for age,
race, sex, BMI etcetera, etcetera.

210
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,760
So, there's a whole bunch of other
variables in the model, but

211
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,989
I'm not even going to bother to write out
in the model.

212
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:44,650
But they are,

213
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,560
those predictors are also included in the
model, just to adjust for confounding.

214
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,360
The predictors that the researchers cared
about here were

215
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,860
two predictors; sleep difficulty, which is
a 3 level categorical variable.

216
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,240
You are either a normal sleeper, that's a
reference group.

217
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,190
You have poor sleep, kind of not at the
level of insomnia, but some trouble.

218
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,900
And then you could have insomnia which is
really trouble sleeping.

219
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,960
They also looked at a three category
variable for sleep duration.

220
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,600
So, they categorized people as getting
more than six hours per night,

221
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,720
getting five to six hours per night, or
getting less than five hours per night.

222
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,310
The reference group is getting is, is the
highest sleeping group,

223
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,400
more than six hours per night.

224
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,390
The [UNKNOWN] regression model with those
two categorical variables as well as

225
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,210
the interactions.

226
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,190
So, let me write out that model.

227
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:37,330
Again, we're modeling the log odds of
hypertension,

228
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,600
it's going to have an intercept.

229
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,510
And because we've got a multilevel
categorical variable,

230
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,520
we're going to be dummy coding.

231
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,120
So, this is a good review of dummy coding,
which we talked about last week.

232
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,690
The reference group is normal sleepers.

233
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:56,340
To dummy code a three level categorical
variable I need two dummy coded variables.

234
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,220
So, normal sleepers will will not get it's
own beta, but I'll have a beta for

235
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,080
poor sleep and I'll have a beta for
insomnia.

236
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,550
If you have a 0, 0 for poor sleep and a 0
for

237
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,950
insomnia, you are by default in the normal
sleeping group.

238
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,960
For sleep duration, I'm going to put in,
the reference is greater than 6 hours, so

239
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,838
I'm going to put in a beta for

240
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:19,680
5 to 6 hours and I'm going to put in a
beta for less than 5 hours.

241
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,510
If you get a 0 on both of those binary
dummy coded variables,

242
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,760
that means by default you're in the
greater than 6 hours duration group.

243
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,180
That's how I dummy code those two
predictors.

244
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,910
But now, the researchers also put in an
interaction term between those

245
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,730
two predictors.

246
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,910
So, let me show you what that looks like
in the model.

247
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,810
And for interacting two three level
categorical variables,

248
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,425
we are going to end up with four
interaction terms in the model.

249
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:48,998
First of all we're going to have an
interaction between poor sleep, and

250
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:52,780
5 to 6 hours duration per night.

251
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,920
We're going to have an interaction between
poor sleep and

252
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,170
less than 5 hours per night.

253
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,570
We're going to have an interaction term
for insomnia,

254
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:07,885
times the 5 to 6 hour duration, and we're
going to have an interaction For

255
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:10,875
insomnia in the less than five hour
duration.

256
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:14,960
Plus remember this model also has all
those other betas for

257
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,270
the confounders that I'm not going to
bother to write out.

258
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,890
So it's a little complicated but

259
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:24,050
each of these interaction terms is either
a one if you are in that group so, for

260
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,840
example, the, the poor sleep times five to
six hours per week.

261
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,780
If you're in the poor sleep group and you
sleep 5 to 6 hours per night, you're

262
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,620
going to get a 1 for that interaction
term, everybody else is going to get a 0.

263
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,280
So this breaks down to a bunch of binary
variables.

264
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,270
From all of these betas, by fitting all
these betas,

265
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,050
you are able to get an oz ratio for

266
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,620
each of these different categories of
both, sleep duration and sleep difficulty.

267
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,200
That's what they generated here,

268
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,330
they generated those odd ratios right from
the logistic regression model.

269
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,360
If you look at the fine print, it says the
interaction between [INAUDIBLE].

270
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,196
Insomnia and objective sleep duration is
statistally significant.

271
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:03,400
So, 2 interaction terms came out
statistcally significant.

272
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,210
Those that interacted insomnia, not poor
sleep,

273
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,444
but insomia with the short sleep duration.

274
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:13,685
And you can also see the interaction just
by looking at

275
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:17,674
the odds ratio that were generated by the
model, here.

276
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:20,880
So if you look at the odds ratios again,
the reference group was normal sleepers

277
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,960
who are sleeping more than 6 hours per
night.

278
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,589
If you compare poor sleepers and

279
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:32,310
insomniacs where everybody's sleeping at
least 6 hours per night, long sleepers.

280
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,730
You'll notice that poor sleep and insomnia
didn't make much difference.

281
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,480
The odds ratios are 1.31, so you don't
really get much increase in your chances

282
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,022
of hypertension if you have bad sleep as
long as you're sleeping enough.

283
00:15:44,022 --> 00:15:45,640
Every night.

284
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,950
If we move over however,

285
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,870
to the group whose sleeping much shorter,
five to six hours per night.

286
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,000
Then you'll notice that normal sleepers
and

287
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,055
poor sleep, there wasn't too much going
on.

288
00:15:55,055 --> 00:16:00,508
But those who have insomnia and are also
sleeping five to six hours per night.

289
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:04,520
Have a 3.5 odds ratio there so

290
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,141
a drastic increase in the odds of
hypertension.

291
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:17,690
Finally if you look at the really short
sleepers The effect of insomnia is even

292
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,200
greater, so as you get up to the insomniac
group and you're having really poor sleep,

293
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:28,110
you get a increase, a much bigger
increase, in your odds of hypertension.

294
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,250
And notice that this odds ratio comes out
statistically significant and so

295
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:31,840
does this one.

296
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,550
So again there's Significant interaction
here.

297
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,470
The sleeping difficulty doesn't seem to
matter as long as you're

298
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,150
getting enough sleep but, if you are not
getting enough sleep,

299
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:46,890
then the sleeping difficulty seems to
really impact your risk of hypertension.

300
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,079
That's what, that's what the interaction,

301
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:55,110
that's the sort of verbal way to describe
the interaction here.

302
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,680
I want to point out and remind you Ratio.

303
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,910
That we are dealing with odds ratios,
here.

304
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,440
And as I told you, talked a lot about in
week 2 of this course,

305
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,852
odds ratios, you have to be careful about
interpreting them.

306
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:09,018
This was a cross sectional study.

307
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:11,263
The outcome was extremely common.

308
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,787
In the reference group.

309
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:17,020
About a quarter of people in the reference
group had hypertension.

310
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,380
So the outcome is very common.

311
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,480
So you have to be careful about
interpreting.

312
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,178
These odds ratios look really big.

313
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:24,430
3.5 and 5.1.

314
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,210
You would not want to say that this was a,

315
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:30,170
that this 3.5 represented a threefold
increase in the risk.

316
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,830
Of hypertension in this group.

317
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,500
And you would not want to say that this
five,

318
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,520
this [INAUDIBLE] ratio of 5 represented a
five-fold increase in

319
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,770
risk of hypertension.

320
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,020
Since the outcome is common these
[INAUDIBLE] ratios are distorted,

321
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,920
these are not the increases in risk.

322
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,930
They are the increases in odds.

323
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,140
If you use little formula I gave you in
week 2 of the course, you could actually

324
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,520
convert back and figure out the risk
ratios, the corresponding risk ratios.

325
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,110
It turns out that there's more like a
doubling in the risk of hypertension here,

326
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,590
not a five fold increase.

327
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,920
So I don't want you to forget when you're
doing logistic regression we're

328
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,750
getting odds ratios Be careful about the
interpretation when you

329
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,206
have a common outcome.

330
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:12,705
This final example actually comes from a
paper that I wrote

331
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:17,850
in graduate school and so excuse the poor
resolution of the graphic.

332
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,000
It's a little bit of an older paper.

333
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,190
But this involved a, an interaction term
that we found in a linear regression.

334
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,166
So just to show you how this works also
for linear regression.

335
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,928
We were looking at three outcomes.

336
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:34,930
This was looking at bone densities, so we
looked at the bone density in the spine,

337
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,380
and in the hip, and overall in the body.

338
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,000
Those were the outcomes.

339
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,700
Since our outcomes are continuous bone
density is continous,

340
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,010
we were doing linear regression not
logistic regression.

341
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,570
Women athelets, this is a study about
women athelets, women runners.

342
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:55,210
Women athletes sometimes if they have
disordered eating, and

343
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,870
irregularities in their menstrual cycle,

344
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,720
it can cause them to loose bone density,
that's what this paper was about.

345
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,160
So, we were looking at kind of two factors
here.

346
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,470
We were looking at an eating disorder
score called the EDI score,

347
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,599
this tells us about eating, disorder
eating behaviors.

348
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,746
So, higher scores says,

349
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:13,880
a woman is more likely to have some kind
of eating disorder.

350
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,910
We also looked at menstrual cycle, and so
we divided women into two groups.

351
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,940
Those are the normal menstrual cycle,
those eumenorrheic women, those are all

352
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,316
the bars in the back of this graphics.

353
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:33,108
And women with menstrual irregularities,
we call that the eligo and

354
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:34,644
amenorrheic group, and that, those are the
bars in the front.

355
00:19:34,644 --> 00:19:36,212
So, we looked at those two menstrual
groups as well as this

356
00:19:36,212 --> 00:19:38,990
disordered eating score, and we looked at
the interaction between those two things.

357
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,070
And we did find a statistically
significant interaction here.

358
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,230
And it's kind of nicely pictured in these
graphics.

359
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,622
So, what's happening here is that,

360
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:51,700
if you look at the women who already has
menstrual irregularities.

361
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,564
If you look at the effect of eating
disorder score, it doesn't seem that

362
00:19:54,564 --> 00:19:58,566
they're bone density changes much at all
across different eating disorder scores.

363
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:00,980
Once you already have menstrual
irregularities,

364
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,987
it doesn't seem to be much additional
effect of eating disorder score.

365
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:08,690
So the bone density is pretty flat across
those different eating

366
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,090
disorder score groups.

367
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,660
If you look however at the women with
normal periods, the eumenorrheic group,

368
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,590
the bars in the back, you can see there's
a pretty dramatic effect for

369
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,480
eating disorder scores.

370
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,260
So, as your eating disorder scores
increases,

371
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,535
your bone density goes down quite a bit.

372
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:27,600
And that's in all three sites.

373
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,290
So, interestingly, there's an interaction
here, because the the effect

374
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,950
of the eating disorder score was different
between these two menstrual groups.

375
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,710
And that had some certain implications
that were of interest.

376
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,080
But, we got the significant interaction in
a linear regression by

377
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:52,430
including the interaction between EDI
score and in menstrual group.
