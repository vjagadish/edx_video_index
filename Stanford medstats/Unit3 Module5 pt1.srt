00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,360
Hi and welcome to our module on Proc Freq.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,270
Freq, which stands for frequency, is an
essential aspect of data analysis and

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,830
SAS enterprise guide.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,550
This procedure creates frequency tables
and contingency tables.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,410
>> If you're taking HRP 225 or

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,090
259, you're probably learning about
contingency tables right now.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,730
Contingency tables which are also called
cross tabulation tables show you

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,931
the frequency distribution of your
variables.

9
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:26,691
Well the name Freq may lead you to believe
that all this procedure does,

10
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:29,911
is create tables based on categorical
data, you'll find that this procedure also

11
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:32,350
does really important statistical measures
on these tables.

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,520
Let's start coding so you can learn about
the more important features of Proc Freq.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,360
>> I want to build a new data set for this
module.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,070
This data set is completely made up so

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,020
that we have an interesting outcome when
we start talking about Chi-Square test.

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,180
Say we have a clinical trial testing out a
new treatment for a disease.

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,100
Let's just call it disease x and we're
interested in finding out if

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,220
treated patients have a better outcome
than non-treated.

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,120
Treated patients get a one and those not
treated get a zero.

20
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,970
Those cured get a one and those not cured
get a zero.

21
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,940
Now that we've created that data set,

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,920
let's start with our first frequency
procedure.

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,540
A frequency distribution of the treatment
variable, which tells the percentage of

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,930
subjects who were treated and the percent
who are not treated.

25
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:15,910
This is how to do it in code.

26
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,710
Notice how the code is pretty similar to
previous procedures I have discussed.

27
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,960
You start with the word proc, followed by
the procedure of interest,

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,170
which in this case, is freq.

29
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,800
We make sure to specify our new data set,
which is a temporary file called trial.

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,320
To create a one way table,

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,040
we include the word tables followed by the
variable we want to analyze.

32
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,960
As you can see, we wrote tables isTreated
and then semicolon.

33
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,100
Let's press run and look at the output.

34
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,170
>> Now you can see the frequency, percent,
cumulative frequency and

35
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,300
then the cumulative percent of the
isTreated variable.

36
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,160
The frequency column shows you how many
observation are in each treated group.

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,020
There were 18 treated, and 17 non treated.

38
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,060
The percent column shows you what percent
of the data received the treatment and

39
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,690
what percentage did not receive the
treatment.

40
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,990
The cumulative frequency and

41
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,350
cumulative percent and not very
informative in this analysis,

42
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,930
you may find these more insightful when it
comes to dealing with ordinal data.

43
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,320
For example, say you measure the
improvement,

44
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,660
after treatment on the ordinal scale from
one to five.

45
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,570
This table would then allow you to say
what percent of your population had

46
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,455
an improvement level of three or less.

47
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:24,680
>> See we're all only interested in one
specific aspect of the output.

48
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,430
For example, if you only wanted to know
the frequency.

49
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,235
We could rewrite our code [SOUND].

50
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:32,860
As you can see, the code's exactly the
same as my initial frequency code.

51
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,690
The only difference is that after
isTreated,

52
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,040
I've included a forward slash with the
words nocum and nopercent.

53
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,270
The forward slash tell SAS that I want to
use some optional settings for

54
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,050
the table statement.

55
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,980
The settings I add in just tell SAS not to
display the cumulative values

56
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,520
and percent values.

57
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,266
There are many code variations that can be

58
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:55,050
made related to a one way frequency
distribution.

59
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,860
As we discussed in the previous module,

60
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,970
it's best to use the online SAS guides to
figure out specific variations.
