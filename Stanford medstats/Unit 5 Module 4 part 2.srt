1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,080
What about the distribution of a
correlation coefficient?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,580
So, the correlation coefficient,

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,825
again ranges from a value of negative one
to positive one.

4
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:12,266
0 means that two variables are
uncorrelated.

5
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:14,345
+1 is perfect positive correlation.

6
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:16,280
-1 is perfect inverse correlation.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,490
Everything in between is some level of
correlation.

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,970
And we have the picture here shows that we
have a very weak correlation between

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,640
vitamin D and cognitive scores.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,570
So what' s the distribution of

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,132
a correlation coefficient another measure
we can calculate from our data.

12
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:31,790
Let me do another computer simulation.

13
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,950
So in this computer simulation I said that
the true correlation between vitamin D and

14
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,650
cognitive function in the entire
population of older.

15
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,580
European men is 0.15.

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,145
If that's true then I can sample from that
population,

17
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:49,560
sample both vitamin D levels and cognitive
scores.

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,880
I select a random sample of a 100 virtual
men.

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,640
They all have a cognitive score and

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,570
a vitamin D level based on this underlying
correlation.

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,820
I calculate the correlation coefficient in
the sample.

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,900
And then I do this, again and

23
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,380
again and again, and let's say I do it
15,000 times this time.

24
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,390
You're getting the idea of a computer
simulation now, and

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,470
then we can explore the distribution of
those 15,000 correlation coefficients.

26
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,680
So, here it is, here's the results.

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,600
So, notice, I found a normal curve again.

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,550
Well, this is great.

29
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,620
Lots of statistics follow normal curves,
so

30
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,290
it turns out the normal curve is very
important for this reason.

31
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,400
So here are some things.

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,500
It's normally distributed, hooray.

33
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,185
The mean turns out to be exactly the true
correlation,

34
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:33,760
0.15, because most of my samples come out
somewhere around 0.15.

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,510
I asked the computer to calculate the
standard deviation of

36
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,700
these 15,000 observations, what we would
also call a standard error here.

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,420
It came out to be, in my simulation, 0.10.

38
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,250
So, that's for

39
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,930
my computer simulation, the distribution
of the correlation coefficient.

40
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,580
It turns out that the shape of the
distribution for

41
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,720
a correlation coefficient, as with the
mean,

42
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,160
is a normal distribution as long as we're
talking about sample sizes above 100.

43
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,540
It is on a T-distribution though for
smaller samples.

44
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,710
So if you have smaller samples, there's
some additional uncertainty and

45
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,370
you actually are at a T-distribution,
which looks a little bit different.

46
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,362
So for smaller samples,

47
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:14,590
you have to worry about being on a T
rather than an, a normal.

48
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,220
But for larger as in this example it's
essentially under normal.

49
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,450
The, the mean of the distribution of a
correlation coefficient is the true is

50
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,550
the true correlation coefficient, not
surprisingly.

51
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,290
The standard error, somebody's worked out
with mathematical theory,

52
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,930
it tuns out to be approximately the square
root of 1 minus r squared and

53
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,615
r is the true correlation coefficient in
the whole population.

54
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:36,380
And divided by the square root of N.

55
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,850
Notice it has a lot of similarity to the
standard error of the mean.

56
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,190
They both have square root of N in their
denominator.

57
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,490
So bigger samples means smaller standard
errors once again.

58
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,120
Turns out that many statistics follow
either normal distributions, or for

59
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,010
small samples, T distributions, so this is
great.

60
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,410
You saw two examples already.

61
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,100
It popped up to be a normal distribution.

62
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,274
Even when we didn't start on a normal
distribution.

63
00:02:59,274 --> 00:03:04,070
It turns out lots of statistics follow
normal distributions or T distributions.

64
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,150
So statistics that follow T distributions
for

65
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,900
small samples and normal distributions for
large samples, include means,

66
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,380
as well as difference in means, and
correlation coefficients.

67
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,200
Things we just saw.

68
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,750
Things that follow normal distributions
whether or not you have a small or

69
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,620
a large n, that is, it's always on a
normal distribution Include proportions,

70
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,510
risks, differences in proportions,

71
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,240
and a statistic that has to do with the
odds ratio.

72
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,590
And since we spent a lot of time on the
odds ratio in week two,

73
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,030
I thought I'd just introduce this now.

74
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,620
It's not quite the odds ratio that follows
the normal distribution,

75
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,090
it's the natural log of the odds ratio
that follows the normal distribution.

76
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,710
So let me just end with this last-
Statistic the odds ratio.

77
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,935
What's the distribution of an odds ratio?

78
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:48,130
Let's do another computer simulation.

79
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,300
You can see how much I love computer
simulations.

80
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,520
So, let's do a simulation for

81
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,170
an odds ratio to figure out the
distribution of an odds ratio.

82
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,360
So, I'm going to say I'm going to be doing
case control studies.

83
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,622
It would be a reason to calculate odds
ratios, as I'm doing a case control study.

84
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:02,940
I'm going to tell the computer,

85
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,350
imagine I've got this large infinite Large
population of cases and controls.

86
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,590
And, 20% of cases are smokers, and 20% of
controls are smokers.

87
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,780
I want to know that I would be doing a
case control study here to gauge

88
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,340
the relationship between smoking and,
being a case.

89
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,000
And let's say that there actually is no
relationship,

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,720
the odds ratio here happens to be one.

91
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,850
Because there, there's equal amount of
smoking in both groups.

92
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:30,350
That's my underlying population, and then
I'm going to, to my simulation.

93
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,480
So, I'm going to repeat over and

94
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,021
over again, case control studies with 100
people.

95
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,980
50 cases and 50 controls.

96
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,770
Every case and every control has a 20
percent chance of being a smoker.

97
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,020
In other words, it follows the binomial.

98
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,840
So that's how I can do this in a computer.

99
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,260
I can tell the computer that we're on a
binomial.

100
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,215
So I randomly select.

101
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:47,960
50 cases and 50 controls.

102
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,360
For that one sample, I calculated an odds
ratio.

103
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,300
I store that in a data set and then I do
this again and again and again.

104
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,430
Like I'm doing repeated, repeated case
control samples.

105
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,060
Repeated case control studies with
different samples of the same size.

106
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,450
Do it, repeat it say 1,000 times.

107
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,420
And then I'm going to observe the
distribution of the odds ratio.

108
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,900
So here we go.

109
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,300
Here's what it comes out to look like.

110
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,540
Wait a minute.

111
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,060
Oh no!

112
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,460
It's not on a normal curve.

113
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,030
Oh dear, everything else came out on a
normal curve.

114
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,840
The odds ratio doesn't naturally follow a
normal curve.

115
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,930
It doesn't follow a bell curve.

116
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,860
So notice that the distribution of the
odds ratio has a rights skue.

117
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,340
The true odds ratio was 1.0 here, so we
are centered around 1.0.

118
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,490
But we have this right skew, why would
that be?

119
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,180
Well the odds ratio is a little different
that the other statistics we've

120
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,370
talked about so far.

121
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,440
The odds ratio is a ratio; ratios can not
have values below zero.

122
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,880
So we have this right hand boundary, we
can't go below zero.

123
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,139
So we kind of end up clustering and going
right up into zero but

124
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,370
we can't go over it.

125
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,030
On the other hand, an odds ratio can be as
big as you please.

126
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,130
We've some big odds ratios in this class.

127
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,950
So the odds ratio can go way out,

128
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,410
it can get, it has no bound on the
right-hand side.

129
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,050
So you can end up with, even when the true
odds ratio is one.

130
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,840
You can end up in, in a given sample, and
when you have small samples like this.

131
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,460
You can end up with some pretty big odds
ratios.

132
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,740
Notice that one in 1000 times, even though
the true odds ratio here is one,

133
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,984
that means there's no association here.

134
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:21,680
Just by chance, one in 1000 times we got
an odds ratio way, way out here at 6.8.

135
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,360
So it can happen just by chance, but its a
Right-skewed Distribution.

136
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,490
So that's a problem because we want
everything to end up on a normal or a T.

137
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,480
So, what can we do to force this to go on
a normal curve?

138
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,500
Actually, there's a little transformation
we can make that will turn the odds ratio,

139
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,800
the distribution of the odds ratio into a
normal curve.

140
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,350
What we can do, is just simply take the
natural log of the odds ratio.

141
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,610
Here is the histogram when I take the
natural log of the odds ratio.

142
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,360
Yay, we're back on a normal curve.

143
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,610
So what happens is, that when you take the
natural log.

144
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,280
Any value for the odds ratio that's
between zero and one.

145
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,050
That's a decimal.

146
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,720
When you take the natural log of a
decimal, you end up with negative values.

147
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,980
So you bring back the negative values back
into play.

148
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,340
And now you end up on a beautiful normal
curve.

149
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,500
It's centered around zero because the
natural log of one which was

150
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,830
the true value here.

151
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,590
The natural log of one is zero.

152
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,150
So, that this curve ends up centered
around zero.

153
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,380
So, we're back on a normal curve.

154
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,000
So, even when we don't start on a normal
curve naturally we can force statistics to

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,410
be on a normal curve.

156
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,700
And when we do statistical inference on
odds ratios we actually are always working

157
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,870
with the natural log of the odds ratio for
this reason.

158
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,840
Now somebody worked out from mathematical
theory the standard error of

159
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,340
the natural log of the odds ratio.

160
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,390
So this is the standard error for

161
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,340
the natural log of the odds ratio for this
curve here.

162
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,961
And it turns out to be the square root of
1 over a plus 1 over b.

163
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:48,440
Plus 1 over C, plus 1 over D.

164
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,720
Don't worry about that formula, but just
realize A is exposed cases,

165
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,600
B is exposed controls, C is unexposed
cases, and d is unexposed controls.

166
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,480
In other words these are the sample sizes.

167
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,760
These are just the sample sizes of
particular groups but

168
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,770
those are the sample sizes.

169
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,100
And notice that the smallest of those
group is contributing the most to

170
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,590
the standard error because it's.

171
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,920
Reciprocals we're looking at here.

172
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,000
So that's the standard era of the odds
ratio.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,550
The, the natural log of the odds ratio.

174
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,280
Notice that like the other standard eras
sample size is very important.

175
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,880
And sample size is in the denominator.

176
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,490
So let me just summarize this.

177
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,090
The distribution of a statistic.

178
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,390
The shape of the distribution of many
statistics is

179
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,800
either a normal distribution or a key
distribution and

180
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,270
if its not we might force it to be on a
normal distribution.

181
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,290
The mean of the distribution of a
statistic turns out

182
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,390
to always be the true value of the
statistic in the larger population.

183
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,100
The standard error differs depending on
what type of

184
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,930
statistic you have there are many
different types of standard errors.

185
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,910
But it's always inversely related to
sample size.

186
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,080
We saw three examples in this module.

187
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,900
The standard error of the mean.

188
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,569
The standard error of the correlation
coefficient.

189
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:59,060
And the standard error of an odds ratio.

190
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,880
All of those had sample size in the
denominator.

191
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,310
So with the bigger the sample size the
lower the standard error.

192
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,270
But notice there's many different standard
errors.

193
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,350
Let me just repeat that, there's many
different stand, standard errors.

194
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,680
A lot of people think that this one,
because this is the one they most commonly

195
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,160
see, the standard error of the mean is the
only way to calculate standard error.

196
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,580
Well no, that's the standard error of the
mean,

197
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,180
every other statistic has its own formula
for standard error.

198
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,840
But notice they're all related to sample
size.
