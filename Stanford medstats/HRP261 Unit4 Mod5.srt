1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,460
In this next module, we're going to talk
about the concept of interaction.

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,370
I mentioned it briefly in an earlier week
in this course, but

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,610
now we're going to really delve into the
concept.

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,109
And I'm going to show you how to test for
interaction in a regression model.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,390
First of all, what is interaction?

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,080
Interaction is when the effect size
differs significantly between

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,290
different subgroups.

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,279
In other words, the relationship between a
treatment and

9
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,305
an outcome might differ depending on say
whether you're a man, or a woman, or

10
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:37,240
some other subgroup characteristic.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,240
For example, if you've got a blood
pressure treatment that

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,980
works significantly better in men than in
women, that's interaction.

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,690
That would mean that the effect size for

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,690
the blood pressure treatment was
significantly bigger in men than in women.

15
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,280
Another term you'll sometimes heard used,
is effect modification.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,190
Effect modification and interaction mean
the same thing.

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,720
You could say that the effect of the blood
pressure treatment

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,190
was modified by gender, or you could say
that the treatment and gender interact.

19
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,810
Either one is fine.

20
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,110
How do we test for interaction in a
regression model?

21
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,180
So to test for interaction in a regression
model, you can add an interaction term to

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,380
that model, and I'll show you what that is
in a minute.

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,940
If that interaction term is statistically
significant,

24
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,670
that indicates, that's proof, of
interaction.

25
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,230
Let's use this little blood pressure
example.

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,940
If I want to test for interaction between
gender and this blood pressure treatment.

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,370
Blood pressure is a continuous outcome
variable, so

28
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,260
I'm going to be running a linear
regression here.

29
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:47,390
I'm going to include in my model a beta
for treatment, and a beta for gender.

30
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,570
And I'm also going to include a term for

31
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,780
the interaction between gender and
treatment.

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,150
And what that is, is it's literally I'm
going to multiply the value for

33
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,880
gender times the value for treatment.

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,160
So let me illustrate that by writing out a
little mock data-set.

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,620
You've got some variable gender,

36
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,730
in this case I've coded it that one is
male and zero is female.

37
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,005
I've got another variable that's
treatment, one means you're on the drug,

38
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,760
zero means you're on placebo.

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,130
Then I've got ID numbers, let's call them
one, two, and three.

40
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:21,370
So let's say the first person here was a
male, and they were on the placebo.

41
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,040
They will get the values one for gender,
zero for treatment.

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,800
Then we've got a female who was on the
treatment.

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,460
That would be a zero, one.
And then

44
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,970
let's say we have a male who's on the
treatment.

45
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,260
That's a one, one.

46
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,220
If you multiply those values together,
that is what an interaction is,

47
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,360
it's gender times treatment.

48
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,920
It's, literally,

49
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,020
we're going to multiply the values of
those two variables together.

50
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,420
So ID number one gets a value of one,

51
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,571
times a value of zero, that's going to
give them an interaction term of zero.

52
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:51,950
The ID number two gender is zero,
treatment is one, zero times one is zero.

53
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,980
ID number three, one times one is one.

54
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,692
Notice that if you've got two binary
predictors, a zero one variable, and

55
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:00,250
another zero, one variable.

56
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,240
The only people, who are going to get a
one for

57
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,620
the interaction, are the people who have a
one on both of those binary variables.

58
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,280
So, in this case only people who both are
male and

59
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
got the drug will get a value of one.

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,609
Everybody else gets a value of zero for
that interaction.

61
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,960
That's the the data the variables that
were then including in the model.

62
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,910
If the beta for the interaction comes out
to be statistically significant this would

63
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,990
indicate that there is a significant
interaction.

64
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,370
And the way you would interpret the betas
from the model, the beta for

65
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,000
treatment in this case, because women as
the reference group, the beta for

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,700
treatment represents the treatment effect
in the women.

67
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,309
The beta, the treatment effect for the men
you get by adding the treatment effect.

68
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,050
The beta for treatment, plus the beta for
interaction.

69
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:00,850
So men, their treatment effect is beta
treatment plus beta interaction.

70
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,870
In other words, the interaction term
represents the difference in

71
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,400
the treatment effect between the men and
the women.

72
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,090
So if that's significantly different,

73
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,840
that indicates a significant difference in
those effect sizes.

74
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,760
Just as a side note here, there is also a
beta gender here.

75
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,070
This term would just indicate whether or

76
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,750
not there was a main effect for gender,
that is whether or

77
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,750
not males have higher blood pressure than
females, unrelated to the treatment.

78
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,100
So that's what a model with an interaction
term looks like.

79
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,840
Now let's visit some real examples of how
to apply this in the medical literature.

80
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,950
In this trial we had women smokers who
were concerned about their weight,

81
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,330
they were afraid to quit because they were
afraid of gaining weight.

82
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,780
These women were randomly assigned to one
of four groups, so they were randomly

83
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,410
assigned to either get weight focused
counseling, or to get standard counseling.

84
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,980
And, they were randomly assigned to get a
drug.

85
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,670
An anti smoking drug Bupropion or to get a
placebo.

86
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,600
So that makes up four total groups.

87
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,660
The outcome here was smoking abstinence.

88
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,250
It was biochemically confirmed.

89
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,750
It's a binary outcome.

90
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,380
You either were abstinent or you weren't.

91
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,839
So that means we're going to be using
logistic regression to analyze the data.

92
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,300
Here's the results of that study.

93
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,330
It's a rather busy table so I'm going to
zoom in on some things now.

94
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,100
First of all, we're looking at actually
three different outcomes here.

95
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,200
They measured the abstinence rates at
three months, six months, and

96
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,270
12 months into the study.

97
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,230
So each of those rows represent a
different time point in this study.

98
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,540
If you just look at the placebo groups
within each of those counseling groups.

99
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,720
You'll see that the rates of abstinence
are pretty similar.

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,690
So at three months it was 18%,

101
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,740
where where in the placebo group in the
weight-focused counseling group

102
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,490
were abstinent versus 19% in the placebo
group in the other counseling group.

103
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,370
Those rates look very similar to what we
would say here is that

104
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,850
there doesn't appear to be a main effect
for counseling.

105
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,043
In the placebo groups, those quitting
rates, and

106
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:05,400
the two counseling groups look pretty much
the same.

107
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,560
What about in the effect for a drug?

108
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,470
So if we compare the placebo group to the
drug group,

109
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,189
within each of those two counseling types,
what do we see?

110
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,620
It appears that the drug actually does
improve quitting rates in both groups.

111
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,200
So if I look at the weight-focused
counseling group,

112
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,340
if you were in the placebo group,

113
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,590
the quitting rate was 18% at three months,
versus in the drug group it was 41%.

114
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,209
At six months you also see a similar, a
pretty big increase.

115
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,550
In the standard counseling group the drug
also appears to have an effect,

116
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,460
and the effect isn't quite as big but

117
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,450
you do see almost a doubling of the
quitting rates if you add the drug.

118
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,190
So for example, in the placebo group at
three months.

119
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,180
The quitting rate was 19% that went to 33%
in the drug group.

120
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,120
At six months it went from 10% to 21%, so
there's a pretty big increase.

121
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,920
Basically a doubling of quitting rates in
the drug group,

122
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,680
even within a standard counseling group.

123
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,830
Now, as we talked in the earlier module on
this example,

124
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,110
the P-value is highly significant for the
weight-focused counseling group,

125
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,500
the P-value comparing placebo and drug
within that group.

126
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,730
It didn't quite make statistical
significance it,

127
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,460
within the Standard counseling group, but
it's very close to that.

128
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,910
What we would conclude is there's just
appears to be a main effect for drug.

129
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,650
Overall, drug seems to be doing something,
even though it didn't quite reach

130
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,220
statistical significance in the Standard
counseling group.

131
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,930
We talked about not misinterpreting those
P-values in an earlier module.

132
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,730
If you look at the, what the author's
concluded in the media coverage of

133
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,710
this study, here's the basic conclusion
that was drawn.

134
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,280
Among weight concerned women smokers, drug
therapy increased the cessation rates

135
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,990
when added to a specialized weight
concerns intervention,

136
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,800
the weight counseling, but not when added
to standard counseling.

137
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,370
The implication there is that there is an
interaction.

138
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,630
They're saying that the drug works in one
group, but not the other.

139
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,540
They're implying that there is an
interaction between drug and

140
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,220
counseling type.

141
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:13,000
However, they haven't done any formal
analyses, to test for an interaction here.

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,610
So there is, they haven't specifically
talked about interaction, but

143
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,010
that's really the implication here.

144
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,740
And they haven't formally tested that.

145
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,510
So I actually took the data in their paper
and ran it in a logistic regression to

146
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,650
test for interaction to see whether or not
there really is an interaction.

147
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,120
And what would it mean if there was an
interaction.

148
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,540
So just go back to this slide for a
minute.

149
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,851
An interaction would mean that the drug
effect, the difference between, you know,

150
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:40,410
going from here to here, the difference
between placebo and drug was much bigger

151
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,420
in the weight focus counseling group then
in the standard counseling group.

152
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,410
It does appear to be somewhat bigger.

153
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,832
That the, change from placebo to drug
appears to be somewhat bigger in

154
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:50,804
the weight focus counseling group, but

155
00:08:50,804 --> 00:08:54,260
not a lot bigger than in the standard
counseling group.

156
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,800
We can formally test whether or not that
effect size is bigger.

157
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,227
We can run a logistic regression with an
interaction term.

158
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:06,740
Here's the logistic regression model or
outcome is smoking abstinence.

159
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,895
I'm going to put in the model a main
effect for drug, a main effect for

160
00:09:10,895 --> 00:09:14,970
counseling type, and an interaction
between drug and counseling type, and

161
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,000
these are all binary variables.

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,500
When I run that model, using the data that
was available on the paper,

163
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,100
I find a significant effect for drug.

164
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,560
There is a significant main effect for
drug.

165
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,730
I find nothing for counseling effect.

166
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,920
The counseling, the data for

167
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,430
counseling does not come out statistically
significant,

168
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,540
and the interaction between drug and
counseling type also does

169
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,510
not come out to be anywhere near
statistically significant.

170
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,490
Indicating that we can't say that there's
a difference in how that

171
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,650
drug works in those two groups.

172
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:49,460
And here I'm just showing you the P-values
for interaction from those models I ran.

173
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,890
I ran three logistic regression models for
each of the time points, and

174
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,970
in none of the cases does the P-value even
approach statistical significance.

175
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,680
So we have no evidence that the effect of
the drug differs by counseling type.

176
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,490
Our main conclusion then,

177
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,190
our correct take home message would be
that the drug improves quitting rates over

178
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,850
counseling alone, period.

179
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,500
There's a main effect for a drug.

180
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,080
There's no main effect for counseling
type, and

181
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,520
there's no interaction between drug and
counseling type.

182
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,680
It's not statistically significant, at
least, so we don't have evidence

183
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,670
that the drug behaves differently in those
two groups, at least not from this study.

184
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,930
The second example I'm going to show you
is a cross-sectional

185
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,660
study of about 1,700 men and women.

186
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,390
In this study they actually did formally
test for

187
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,240
interaction and they actually did find a
significant interaction.

188
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,060
This study was looking at the relationship
between sleep duration and

189
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,968
sleep problems and hypertension.

190
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:45,900
It's a cross-sectional study, but

191
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,600
they treated hypertension as the outcome
variable.

192
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,550
Hypertension is binary, yes, no.

193
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,620
So we're going to be using, they did use
logistic regression.

194
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,190
Let me show you the main results of that
study.

195
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,950
This chart's a little complicated, so I'm
going to kind of walk you through it.

196
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,650
And I want to actually also,

197
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,840
write out the logistic regression model
that was used here.

198
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,210
I think it's, it, it's a little
complicated, but it's instructive.

199
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,680
So first of all, what are we looking at?

200
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,310
The outcome here is hypertension.

201
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,500
So we're looking at odds ratios for

202
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,420
hypertension, based on two predictor
variables.

203
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,850
Sleep difficulty and sleep duration.

204
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,930
If you read the fine print, I just want to
note here,

205
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,170
that there's other things in the model
between, besides those two predictors.

206
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,980
It says all data were adjusted for age,
race, sex, BMI, etc, etc.

207
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,780
So there's a whole bunch of other
variables in the model that

208
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,670
I'm not even going to bother to write out
in the model, but there,

209
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:42,380
those predictors are also included in the
model just to adjust for confounding.

210
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,190
The predictors that the researchers cared
about here were two predictors,

211
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,860
sleep difficulty which is a three level
categorical variable.

212
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,138
You were either a normal sleeper, that's
the reference group.

213
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:57,210
You had poor sleep, kind of, not at the
level of insomnia, but some trouble.

214
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,780
And then you could have insomnia, which is
really trouble sleeping.

215
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,040
They also looked at a three category
variable for sleep duration.

216
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,620
So they categorized people as getting more
than six hours per night,

217
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,700
getting five to six hours per night, or
getting less than five hours per night.

218
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,330
The reference group is getting, this, the
highest sleeping group,

219
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,716
more than six hours per night.

220
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:21,331
They ran a logistic regression model with
those two categorical variables,

221
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:23,200
as well as the interactions.

222
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,770
So let me write out that in model.

223
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,290
Again, we're modeling the log odds of
hypertension.

224
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,650
It's going to have an intercept.

225
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,450
And because we've got a multilevel
categorical variable,

226
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,480
we're going to be dummy coding, so this a
good review of dummy coding.

227
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,920
The reference group is normal sleepers.

228
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,610
To dummy code a three level categorical
variable,

229
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,710
I need two dummy coded variables.

230
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,650
So, normal sleepers will will not get its
own beta but I'll have a beta for

231
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,060
poor sleep, and I'll have a beta for
insomnia.

232
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,300
If you have a zero, zero for poor sleep
and

233
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,850
a zero for insomnia, you are by default in
the normal sleeping group.

234
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,310
For sleep duration I'm going to put in the
references greater than six hours, so

235
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,300
I'm going to put in a beta for five to six
hours, and

236
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,990
I'm going to put in a beta for less than
five hours.

237
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,910
If you get a zero on both of those binary
dummy coded variables,

238
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,170
that means by default you're in the
greater than six hours duration group.

239
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,500
That's how I dummy code those two
predictors.

240
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,050
But now, the researchers also put it in an
interaction term

241
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,250
between those two predictors.

242
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,270
So let me show you what that looks like in
the model.

243
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,700
And for interacting two, three level
categorical variables,

244
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,720
we're going to end up with four
interaction terms in the model.

245
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:42,180
First of all, we're going to have an
interaction between poor sleep, and

246
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,500
five to six hours duration per night.

247
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,764
We are going to have an interaction
between poor sleep, and

248
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:49,640
less than five hours per night.

249
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,496
We are going to have an interaction term
for

250
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:55,941
insomnia, times the five to six hour
duration.

251
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:59,759
And we are going to have an interaction
for insomnia, and

252
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,170
the less than five hour duration.

253
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,250
Plus remember this model also has all
those other betas for

254
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,570
the confounders, that I'm not going to
bother to write out.

255
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,230
So it's a little complicated but

256
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,130
each of these interaction terms is either
a one if you are in that group.

257
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,180
So for example the, the poor sleep times
five to six hours per week.

258
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,020
If you're in the poor sleep group and you
sleep five to six hours per night,

259
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,370
you're going to get a one for that
interaction term,

260
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,980
everybody else is going to get a zero.

261
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,200
So this breaks down to a bunch of binary
variables.

262
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,330
From all of these betas,

263
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,490
by fitting all these betas you are able to
get an odds ratio for

264
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,970
each of these different categories of both
sleep duration and sleep difficulty.

265
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,510
That's what they generated here,

266
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:45,210
they generated those odds ratios right
from the logistic regression model.

267
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,410
If you look at the fine print.

268
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,630
It says the interaction between insomnia
and

269
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,410
objective sleep duration is statistically
significant.

270
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,690
So two interaction terms came out
statistically significant.

271
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,620
Those that interacted insomnia, not poor
sleep, but

272
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,440
insomnia, with the short sleep duration.

273
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,725
And you can also see the interaction just
by looking at the odds ratios that,

274
00:15:06,725 --> 00:15:09,430
were generated by the model here.

275
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,650
So if you look at the odds ratios again,

276
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,480
the reference group was normal sleepers
who are sleeping more than

277
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,360
six hours per night.

278
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,090
If you compare poor sleepers and
insomniacs who,

279
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,650
where everybody is sleeping at least six
hours per night, long sleepers,

280
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,080
you'll notice that poor sleep and insomnia
didn't make much difference.

281
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,410
The odds ratios are 0.79 and 1.31.

282
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,497
So you don't really get much increase in
your chances of hypertension if

283
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:36,608
you have bad sleep, as long as you're
sleeping enough, every night.

284
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:40,085
If you move over however to the group
who's sleeping much shorter,

285
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:43,867
five to six hours per night, then you'll
notice that normal sleepers and

286
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:46,270
poor sleep, there wasn't too much going
on.

287
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,902
But, those who have insomnia and

288
00:15:48,902 --> 00:15:55,510
are also sleeping only five to six hours
per night, have a 3.5 odds ratio there.

289
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,920
So a drastic increase in the odds of
hypertension.

290
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,610
Finally if you look at the really short
sleepers

291
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,950
the effect of insomnia is even greater.

292
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,020
So as you get up to the insomniac group,

293
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,780
and you're having really poor sleep, you
get a increase.

294
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,340
A much bigger increase in your odds of
hypertension.

295
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,490
And notice that this odds ratio comes out
statistically significant, so

296
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,430
does this one.

297
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,750
So, again, there, there's a significant
interaction here.

298
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,280
The sleeping difficulty, doesn't seem to
matter,

299
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,480
as long as you're getting enough sleep,
but if you are not getting enough sleep,

300
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,230
then the sleeping difficulty seems to
really impact your risk of hypertension.

301
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,430
That's what, that's what the interaction,

302
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,014
that's the sort of verbal way to describe
the interaction here.

303
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:52,100
I want to point out and remind you that we
are dealing with odds ratios here, and

304
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,780
as I told you, talked a lot about in week
two of this course,

305
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,830
odds ratios, you have to be careful about
interpreting them.

306
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,190
This was a cross-sectional study.

307
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,380
The outcome was extremely common in the
reference group.

308
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,470
About a quarter of people in the reference
group had hypertension, so

309
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,340
the outcome is very common.

310
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,820
So you have to be careful about
interpreting,

311
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,400
these odds ratios look really big 3.5 and
5.1.

312
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,720
You would not want to say that this was a,
that

313
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,140
this 3.5 represented a three fold increase
in the risk of hypertension in this group.

314
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,940
And you would not want to say that this
five,

315
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:29,310
this odds ratio of five represented a five
fold increase in risk of hypertension.

316
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,320
Since the outcome is common these odds
ratios are distorted.

317
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,270
These are not the increases in risk.

318
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,330
They're the increases in odds.

319
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,550
If you use the little formula I gave you
in week one, you could actually convert

320
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,540
back and figure out the risk ratios, the
corresponding risk ratios.

321
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,070
It turns out that there's more like a
doubling in the risk of hypertension here,

322
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,580
not a five fold increase.

323
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,736
So I don't want you to forget when we're
doing logistic regression,

324
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:53,790
you getting odds ratios,

325
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,800
be careful about the interpretation when
you have a common outcome.

326
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,830
This final example actually comes from a,

327
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:07,080
a paper that I wrote in Graduate school
and so excuse the,

328
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,000
the poor resolution of the graphic, it's a
little bit of an older paper.

329
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,150
But this evolved in the interaction term
that we found in a linear regression.

330
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,550
So, just to show you how this works also
for a linear regression.

331
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,100
We were looking at three outcomes.

332
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,900
This was looking at bone density so

333
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,560
we looked at the bone density in the spine
and in the hip and overall in the body.

334
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,990
Those were the outcomes.

335
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,680
Since our outcomes are continuous bone
density is continuous,

336
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,040
we were actually doing linear regression
here not logistic regression.

337
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,550
Women athletes, this is a study about
women athletes, women runners.

338
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,710
Women athletes sometimes if they have
disordered eating.

339
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,570
And irregularities in the menstrual cycle,
it can cause them to lose bone density.

340
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,720
That's what this paper was about.

341
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,090
So we were looking at two factors here.

342
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,400
We were looking at an eating disorder
score, it the, called the EDI score.

343
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,700
This tells us about eating, disordered
eating behavior, so

344
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,750
higher scores is, the woman is more likely
to have some kind of eating disorder.

345
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,840
We also looked at menstrual cycle and so
we divided women into two groups.

346
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,878
Those with a normal menstrual cycle, those
are the eumenorrheic women,

347
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:15,700
those are all the bars in the back of
these graphics.

348
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,000
And women with menstrual irregularities we
call that the oligo and

349
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,850
amenorrheic group, and that those are the
bars in the front.

350
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,300
So we looked at those two menstrual groups
and as well as this

351
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,940
disordered eating score and we looked at
the interaction between those two things.

352
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,040
And we did find a statistically
significant interaction here.

353
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,180
And this kind of nicely pictured in these
graphics.

354
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,120
So what's happening here is that if you
look at

355
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,660
the women who already have menstrual
irregularities.

356
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,240
If you look at the effect of eating
disorder score.

357
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,082
That doesn't seem that their bone density
changes much at

358
00:19:48,082 --> 00:19:50,450
all across different eating disorder
scores.

359
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,140
Once you already have menstrual
irregularities, it doesn't seem to be much

360
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,470
additional effect of eating disorder
score, so the bone density is

361
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,720
pretty flat across those different eating
disorder score groups.

362
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,600
If you look however at the women with
normal periods, the eumenorrheic group,

363
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,530
the bars in the back, you can see there is
a pretty dramatic effect for

364
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,380
eating disorder score.

365
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,160
So as your eating disorder score
increases,

366
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,300
your bone density goes down quite a bit.

367
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,530
And that's in, on all three sites.

368
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:24,200
So, interestingly, there's an interaction
here, because the, the effect of

369
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,000
the eating disorder score was different
between these two menstrual groups, and

370
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,650
that had some certain implications that
were of interest.

371
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,130
But, we got the significant interaction in
a linear regression by

372
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,370
including the interaction between EDI
score and in menstrual group.
