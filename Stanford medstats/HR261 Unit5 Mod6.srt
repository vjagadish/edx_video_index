1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,380
In this next module, I'm going to explain
the difference between modeling a variable

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,360
as a categorical variable versus an
ordinal variable And I'm also going to

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,150
talk about a test that's directly related
to that called the p value for trend test.

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,440
So if you have an ordinal variable, that
is a variable that's ordered category is

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,490
something like a Likert scale, you might
end up coding that variable as numeric.

6
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,510
So like code it 1 through 5 and

7
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,290
you could choose to analyze that data then
as a number that predictable variable but

8
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,460
could be treated as a number in the
regression model.

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,460
Now there are some assumptions if you do
this.

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,050
So, if you just throw that variable,

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,410
that number 1 through 5 into your model,
you are making an assumption.

12
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,107
So, in a logistic regression, you are
assuming that the logit of

13
00:00:53,107 --> 00:00:58,300
the outcome has a linear relationship with
across the numbers, 1 through 5.

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,744
So literally that there would be a line.

15
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:03,950
You know, So if you plotted that, it would
something that was, roughly, on a line.

16
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,490
Now that's somewhat of an, of a big
assumption, right,

17
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,120
you're assuming that you're, as you go
from category one to two, that your,

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,560
your increase in risk, your jump in risk,
or your jump in the logit, of,

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,630
of the outcome, is equal across all of
these different levels.

20
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,240
And that may be true in some cases, but

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,770
you can imagine a lot of cases where those
categories aren't really evenly spaced,

22
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,080
and that your risk doesn't jump up evenly
across the categories.

23
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,740
You're assuming that when you just treat
that variable as a number.

24
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,510
You're only going to also get a single
estimate when you

25
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,620
put that variable into your logistic
regression model.

26
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,870
You're going to get a single beta and a
single odd ratio.

27
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,770
The reason being is that when you treat
this as a number you're

28
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,260
literally just getting one slope that's
the reason for that one.

29
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,240
You're going to get one p value.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,890
Now that might be have some advantages.

31
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,590
If you have a small data set, the thing
about categorical variables is that if you

32
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,370
have a large number of categories, and you
dummy code them, that eats up a lot of,

33
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,520
you have to estimate a lot of betas.

34
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,030
That eats up a lot of degrees of freedom.

35
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,130
So if you're dealing with a small data
set, sometimes you might want to

36
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,130
treat something as an ordinal variable
just because you don't have enough degrees

37
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,880
of freedom to model it, to dummy code all
the categories.

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,480
Alternatively of course, you could just
take your ordinal variable and

39
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,400
treat it as categorical, treat it as dummy
coded.

40
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,830
In the way that we do with any categorical
variable.

41
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,100
This makes no assumptions about the
relationships between increasing

42
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,640
categories, because you're allowing every
category comp, you're comparing,

43
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,310
you're calculating a separate odds ratio
for

44
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,510
every category relative to the reference
group.

45
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,810
And so if one of the odds ratios is 3, and

46
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,260
the next category has an odds ratio you
know, of 2.9 and

47
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,200
there's really no increase, you'll you'll
capture all of that differences.

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,730
Of course it costs more degrees of freedom
you've gotta estimate all those betas and

49
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,850
all those odds ratios so that sometimes
can be an issue.

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,510
Now be very careful,

51
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,360
I just want to point out that sometimes
when you're coding data.

52
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,112
You take a categorical variable something
like the occupation and

53
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:59,610
just because it's easy to type it in, you
might end up coding it as a number.

54
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,790
Like one means teacher, two means social
worker, ectera.

55
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,930
That occupation variable is truly nominal
variable.

56
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,420
It is not ordered categories right now.

57
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,350
So just be careful that you don't
accidently dump that.

58
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,510
Variable into your regression model and

59
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,750
treat it as a number without even
realizing it.

60
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,560
You have to clearly, you cannot treat that
as a number.

61
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,580
It must be dummy coded.

62
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,220
Just to, illustrate all of this with an
examnple.

63
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,090
This was a study that was looking at
whether or not for men if they're

64
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,990
breastfed as infants are they more likely
to or less likely to be obese or

65
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,470
overweight later in life and I'm just
focusing here on the results for obesity.

66
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,950
So these are odds ratios this was a
logistic regression,

67
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,560
the outcome is obesity and breastfeeding
was measured in Five categories.

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,040
And now this probably has to do something
with how the questionnaire was set up.

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,970
Maybe there was a questionnaire where
people had to check off these categories.

70
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,270
So we ended up with five categories.

71
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,220
You could have measured breast feeding as
a continuous variable, but

72
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,220
I'm assuming here that it probably wasn't
measured as continuous and

73
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,660
that's why they're treating it as a
categorical variable.

74
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,716
But it clearly ordered categories, right?

75
00:04:05,716 --> 00:04:09,220
So here's category one, two, three, four
and five.

76
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,090
So, the reference group are those who were
fed, breastfed for at least four months.

77
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,910
And then the, the,

78
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,350
the sort of, highest risk group is those
who were breastfed for less than a month.

79
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,609
And then we have categories in between.

80
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,650
But they're clearly ordered.

81
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,200
Okay, looking at the results, what do we
see here?

82
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,220
First of all, where do these ratios come
from?

83
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,400
The first row here is just a crude odds
ratio,

84
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,620
it means we haven't adjusted for
everything.

85
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,670
Notice the crude and the adjusted odds
ratios look awfully similar.

86
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,960
So the adjustment doesn't make a huge
difference here.

87
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,260
So where did the odds ratios come from?

88
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,400
Well, I fit a, or the authors here fit a
logit model for

89
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,960
obesity With an alpha that represents the
reference group and

90
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,280
then four betas for those four additional
categories.

91
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,080
Those translate therefore into four odds
ratios.

92
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,130
We calculated those odds ratios here's
what they come out to be

93
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,960
you can see that the first of the non
breastfed group essentially looks to

94
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,517
have somewhat of an elevated risk.

95
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:06,424
We also get a P value for linear trend
which is trying to summarize and

96
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:08,170
cross all those different categories.

97
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,280
That I will talk about in just a minute
but

98
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,990
again when I'm doing w coding my equation
is going to look like this.

99
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,310
I have to estimate four parameters.

100
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,820
Well we can also try to look at this
visually.

101
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,840
I did a plot of those odds ratios.

102
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,340
I can't do the log plot here cause I don't
have the original data but

103
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,350
I can take the odds ratios that were in
the paper.

104
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,472
And just for illustration's purposes just
plot them against these categories 1

105
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:30,380
through 5.

106
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,070
This is just show you that they kind of
jump around a little.

107
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,800
This is not certainly not a smooth curve
because odds ratio was

108
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,750
estimated separately.

109
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,610
Now what would happen though if I were to

110
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,474
model breast feeding as an ordinal
variable that is literally just.

111
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:46,880
Coded as one, two, three, four, five for
those five categories, and

112
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,090
dump it in the model at, treat it as a
number, the number 1 through 5.

113
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,410
I'm now only going to have a single beta,

114
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,280
because I'm, I'm treating it essentially
as a numeric or continuous variable.

115
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,120
I'm going to get out a single beta.

116
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,960
And I can kind of,

117
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,870
I can't actually run this on this data,
because I don't have it, but I can guess.

118
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,100
From the odds ratio published in the paper
that if I did that the betas going to come

119
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,670
out somewhere around lets say about -.08.

120
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,478
Then, I can then do both the logit plot
and the odds ratio plot.

121
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:14,100
The logit plot's going to be really easy,
assuming that I'm

122
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,800
pretty close on my estimate here is my
categories one, two, three, four, five.

123
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,310
My logit plot is again just going to be a
straight line so

124
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,450
I'm going to be going down across the
categories here and

125
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,950
my beta will be -.08 that's the slope of
that line.

126
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,620
So if my logit plot will just be a
straight line.

127
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,990
If I plot the odds ratios like I did in
the previous slide it'd

128
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,770
actually be a little bit curved cause we
don't have a linear relationship with

129
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,070
the odds ratios but with the beta.

130
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,230
The P value for this beta I know, comes
out to be .03 and the reason I

131
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:48,200
know that is because they told us that the
P value for linear trend is .03.

132
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,290
And all the P variable from the near trend
is, is when you put the variable in

133
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,840
as an ordinal variable, so I know that
beta is going to have a P value of .03.

134
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,120
And just to show you here is were we have
a single Beta.

135
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,670
This is ordinal graph.

136
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,450
Of the odds ratios.

137
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,970
You can see it's smooth, cause we only
estimated one beta,

138
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,490
essentially one odds ratio, one set of
odds ratios.

139
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,450
And then for when we treated it as
categorical, if you plot the odds ratios

140
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,280
it looks jagged, because we estimated
separate odds ratios for each category.

141
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,840
Now this P value for linear trend again
all it is, is if I take the model and

142
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,930
I do the logit of obesity [SOUND] and

143
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,940
I plug in a single data for breastfeeding,
that's the number 1 through 5.

144
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,500
That ordinal variable, I treat it as a
ordinal variable The p-value that's

145
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,680
associated with this beta, that is the
p-value for linear trend.

146
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,810
That's where it comes from, it came at
3.03 in this case.

147
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,730
Well, what does that really mean?

148
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,570
Well, all that really means is okay.

149
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,700
Again I don't know the exact logit plot
here but I can kind of guess

150
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,010
what the logit plot would look like if I
had the original raw data.

151
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,200
I can kind of guess about what it would
look like.

152
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,310
And you know it's going to be something
like, well clearly our

153
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:03,100
category one was elevated and then there
was you know some little bit of elevation.

154
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,440
Category four is actually lower than five.

155
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,990
So you know, its going to look something
like that and

156
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,070
I can fit a line to those points.

157
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,110
That's all I'm doing when I'm treating
this as an ordinal variable.

158
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,390
I'm fitting a line to those points.

159
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,770
So lets I fit the line to those points.

160
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,030
It comes out like that and

161
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,360
that slope is enough to trigger
statistical significance.

162
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,290
Well that comes out to be statistical
significance.

163
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,040
Therefore my p-value for linear trend is
signiificant.

164
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,780
What does that mean?

165
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,510
All it means is that if I fit a line to
those five points, and

166
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,740
five points isn't a lot, it, the slope is
significant.

167
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,810
Well how can I trigger a significant
p-value for a linear trend?

168
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,900
Well there's a lot of ways to do it.

169
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,550
You know, if I again, let's say I just had
the same kind of data set but

170
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,120
really there was no elevation.

171
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,670
And here's my reference group and then
there,

172
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,980
there was only one group, the most extreme
group from the reference group.

173
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,020
Category one versus category five that one
happened to be elevated well guess what I

174
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,250
can probably if I fit the line to those
data it's also probably going to

175
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,330
be a statistically significant slope.

176
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,790
Does that mean that I'm increasing
linearally as I go across the categories?

177
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,287
Clearly not it just means that you know,

178
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:05,970
the category one was elevated compared
with category five.

179
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,170
That could be enough.

180
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,160
To trigger a significant linear p-value
for linear trends.

181
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,000
You have to be a little careful.

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,540
It doesn't tell you about dose response.

183
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,980
It doesn't tell you a whole heck of a lot.

184
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,370
It's just one way though that you can
summarize across multiple

185
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,320
categories an overall p-value.

186
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,220
You can see that in the overall chart here
the p-values come out to be .03

187
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,380
for obesity.

188
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,930
I'm showing both the crude and adjusted
here.

189
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,350
That's largely triggered by the fact that
we have Elevation in

190
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,270
that first category and a little bit of
decrease as we go across

191
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,850
the categories towards the reference
group.

192
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,500
It does give you a single p value, though,

193
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,750
that you can point to, which is why people
use it.

194
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,060
If, you try to calculate a p value for

195
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,020
each of these separate categories, you do
get one when you dummy code.

196
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,160
But if people worry about,

197
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,490
well then, multiple testing because I'm
reporting so many p values.

198
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,890
They want one summary measure, so

199
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,130
this gives a summary measure that tells
you something across those categories.

200
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,780
Again, it doesn't tell you a whole heck of
a lot, though,

201
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,400
it just tells you that if you were to fit
a line to only those five points,

202
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,590
that at least the slope of that line would
be significant.

203
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,050
Just to show you one more example of a p
for trend, so we saw this example

204
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,840
earlier about dietary patterns and breast
cancer risk, they also reported a p for

205
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,635
trend, because they had the same kind of
thing, they had an ordinal variable.

206
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:24,500
Quin-tiles of dietary pattern they broken
up into quin-tiles for

207
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,260
whatever reason perhaps because they
didn't think it was linear,

208
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,604
well it's actually didn't have a [UNKNOWN]
it was,

209
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:35,320
it was contravention perhaps, it didn't
think it was linear in that model.

210
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,250
For some reason they've broken it up into
categories, so the reference could be

211
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,310
the lowest quin-tile, and what you can see
is the one that comes

212
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,730
really significant in the P value for
trend is this salad and wine diet.

213
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,380
That's really triggered by if you look,

214
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,100
you know, it's pretty much staying right
around 1.0.

215
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,710
And then suddenly in the fifth category,
it jumps up in risk.

216
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,760
So the logit plot here is going to look
something like [SOUND].

217
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,650
And basically, here is my reference group.

218
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,950
If you go up a little bit, maybe a little
bit in group three,

219
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,790
kind of sticking around one,

220
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,540
and then suddenly there's a big jump up in
group five.

221
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,884
Well, yeah, if I fit a,

222
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:12,320
a line to those five points, yeah, it'll,
it's going to trigger a significant.

223
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,400
It kind of came out to a highly
significant.

224
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,360
Slope there, so we do get a significant
slope but

225
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,830
its not based on a lot of points and

226
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,960
it just means that the highest category
was a lot higher then the lowest category.

227
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,080
So again, take the P value for

228
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,270
trend with a grain of salt, it is one way
though that you can summarize.

229
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,040
When you're doing, when you have ordered
categories it is one way that

230
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,285
you can get a single p value associated
with those ordered categories.
