[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:15,460
Okay this is chapter three of our series
on homologous recombination.

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,170
Here we're going to describe something
called unequal crossover.

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:26,727
So, in unequal crossover you can actually
get something called gene duplication.

5
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:30,390
And what I'm going to do is diagram for
you how this can happen.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,260
The only way you can have unequal
crossover of

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,110
course is if you have crossover.

8
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:42,234
And in the last session we described how
crossover can occur if you resolve

9
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:48,680
the two holiday junctions with one
longitudinal cut and one transverse cut.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,817
And so I've drawn for you or I've kept for
you here the diagram of

11
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:58,879
the cuts in the holiday junctions that
will lead to crossover.

12
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,021
And as a result of this you will have a
blue chromosome turning into

13
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:09,050
a red chromosome from here, this blue
chromosome.

14
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,636
Okay, on the other side off the holiday
junction will continue on as

15
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:14,830
a red chromosome.

16
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,340
And this red chromosome over here will
continue on as a blue chromosome.

17
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,650
Because the transverse cuts lead to
crossover.

18
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:31,170
So now imagine that you have a genome
where there are homologous sequences

19
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:31,950
scattered throughout.

20
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,150
Let me give you an example.

21
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,030
This, and this did happen to the
beta-globin gene.

22
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,891
Suppose you have beta-globin genes and one
beta-globin gene, and

23
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:47,000
it's surrounded by repeated sequences.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,148
So I'm going to draw for you a beta-globin
gene.

25
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,940
Here is a beta-globin gene.

26
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,270
All right.

27
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,530
And it's surrounded by repeated sequences.

28
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,050
All right.

29
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,400
So, this beta-globin gene is surrounded by
repeated sequences.

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,891
And I'll draw for you a repeated sequence.

31
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:13,299
And in fact, lets call this repeated
sequence.

32
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:18,619
Lets just, in fact, it's true that there
are sequences called line

33
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:23,939
elements that actually could flank the
beta-globin genes, so

34
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:26,625
let me call this line element L1.

35
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,676
Okay?

36
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:30,046
L1 the end.

37
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:33,410
Again, this is the beta-globin gene.

38
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:38,915
And I'm going to describe to you how an
equal crossover can end

39
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:43,156
generate a duplication of the beta-globin
gene.

40
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:48,502
Imagine that the DNA undergoes hemologous
recombination, but

41
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:55,432
it undergoes homologous recomination by
winding up the homologous chromosomes,

42
00:02:55,432 --> 00:03:00,976
but occasionally it can produce a
misalignment because of these,

43
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:04,750
the presence of these repeated sequences.

44
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,240
And as a result of that misalignment this
is what could happen.

45
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,218
So, let me draw the beta-globin gene over
here.

46
00:03:15,218 --> 00:03:21,922
All right.

47
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:25,710
And, there's another line element.

48
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,840
I'm running out space but bear with me.

49
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,902
And over here, the other side of the
beta-globin gene

50
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:42,139
with the other line element that flanks
it.

51
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:48,579
So, so suppose during that homologous
recombination occurs by searching for

52
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:53,639
the hymology between the line element on
the upper chromosome and

53
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,953
the line element on the lower chromosome.

54
00:03:56,953 --> 00:04:00,715
As a result of that, the hymologous
recombination if it

55
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:05,997
occurs between these two line elements
will lead to a misalignment of the DNA,

56
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:11,699
and that will result in what's called a
crossover, I'll use that as the notation.

57
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:18,322
And the way that would happen, of course,
is by homologous recombination up here,

58
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:24,894
because we're going to imagine that the
line element, L1, is here in this region.

59
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:26,281
L1.

60
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:28,145
Line.

61
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:33,080
Okay, so

62
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,400
the homologous recombination would be
occurring between two line elements so

63
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,500
I've drawn, say, a blow up of the line
element here

64
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,100
in the upper panel and and then you'll
have

65
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,640
resolution of the holiday junctions in a
way that leads to crossover.

66
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,748
So this, this X here indicates the
crossover.

67
00:04:55,748 --> 00:04:59,767
As a result of that crossover you now have
a resolution into two

68
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,476
different chromosomes.

69
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:08,003
One chromosome will have, two B-globin
genes.

70
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:12,901
So the upper chromosome here, let's draw
that in.

71
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:16,992
We'll have one beta-globin gene.

72
00:05:16,992 --> 00:05:17,780
Okay?

73
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,660
So you have one beta-globin gene along
with its line element, L1.

74
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,160
Okay?

75
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:34,130
And then you come over here to do this
downstream line element.

76
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,990
You have a homologous combination with a
crossover.

77
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:45,470
And so, you would end up with a line
element right.

78
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,360
Let's line them up.

79
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,840
Let's line up the line elements.

80
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,330
Oh boy.

81
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,320
Bad pun.

82
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:00,560
Okay, here we go with the second
beta-globin gene.

83
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,891
And it's downstream line element.

84
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:11,639
Okay, and the lower chromosome will start
over here.

85
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,996
Do the un, the crossover.

86
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:15,387
And come up here.

87
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:22,608
And as a result of that, you'll have this
kind of chromosome

88
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:29,701
with only a single line element and no
beta-globin genes.

89
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:35,206
So, as a result of this unequal crossover,
one chromosome now has two

90
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:41,012
beta-globin genes and the other chromosome
has no beta-globin genes.

91
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:46,769
And again, these are the products of what
we call unequal crossover.

92
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:48,373
So this is unequal.

93
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:51,734
[BLANK_AUDIO]

94
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:55,956
Crossover.

95
00:06:55,956 --> 00:07:00,176
And you can see that this type of unequal
crossover can now lead to

96
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:03,147
a chromosome with no beta-globin genes, or

97
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:08,096
think of another situation where you have
a primordial globin gene.

98
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:12,790
You may already know that there are many
different globin genes.

99
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,680
There's an alpha globin, there's a
beta-globin, and so on.

100
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,780
And what may have happened long ago was
that there was a single globin gene

101
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:27,560
flanked by repetitive sequences like this
line element L1.

102
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,300
That primordial globin gene could have
been duplicated into

103
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,920
two different primordial globin genes
which then could evolve separately.

104
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,870
One to eventually becoming the beta-globin
gene, and

105
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,280
the other eventually becoming the
alpha-globin gene.

106
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,350
So that's how unequal crossover works.

107
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,850
Thank you.
