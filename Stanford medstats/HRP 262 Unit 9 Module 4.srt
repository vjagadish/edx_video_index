1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:11,350
Up until now we have been implicitly
assuming that change over time was linear.

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,390
Of course, there's no reason it has to be
linear.

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,150
You can imagine that there may be cases
where you have non linear time effects and

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,500
I'm going to show you an example of that
in this module.

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,750
So just to have some data here, I made up
some data.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,500
This is similar to data that you're
analyzing in your homework.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,720
So imagine that 50 patients are randomized
to an exercise intervention, these are all

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,410
elderly patients, and 50 patients are
randomized to a control group.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,900
The outcome here is the mini mental state
exam score, this is a continuous variable

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,060
and it measures cognitive function and
higher scores are better.

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,360
The blue group is the exercise group, the
red group is the control group.

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,992
And what you can see that is,

13
00:00:50,992 --> 00:00:54,810
that it indeed looks like the exercise
group did better over time.

14
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,480
They had less of a declining cognitive
function over time.

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,060
But what's also interesting in this
graphic is that you'll notice that

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,340
the trajectory over time doesn't look like
a straight line.

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,230
It looks more curved, more like a
quadratic.

18
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,829
And you can see that even better if you
graph using a scatter plot like

19
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:14,130
I've shown you how to do.

20
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,949
You can definitely see that there appears
to be a quadratic element to the rate of

21
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:20,420
change in depression scores over time.

22
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,020
So that means we're probably going to have
to include a time squared term in

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,040
our regression models.

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,003
So I went ahead and ran a series of models
here, so

25
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:33,350
all of the models contain a cognitive
square as the outcome, a main effect for

26
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,067
time, a main effect for group, the
interaction of time by group, but

27
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:40,670
I also included this quadratic effect for
time.

28
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,190
And then I ran three different models.

29
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,230
I ran a model with only a random
intercept.

30
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,976
We've seen in some cases that's
sufficient.

31
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:50,564
I ran a model with a random intercept and
a random time slope and

32
00:01:50,564 --> 00:01:55,118
I ran a model with a random effect for the
intercept for the linear time as well as

33
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,610
for the quadratic time because that also
may vary between different subjects.

34
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,390
I'll just show you the results of those
three models.

35
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,380
Here's the random intercept model only.

36
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,660
Pay attention to the AIC.

37
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,740
It turns out to be 1639 here.

38
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:14,260
If we look at the results we see that the
intercept here represents at baseline

39
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:20,110
the average for the control group, the
average cognitive score was about 23.

40
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:27,160
The main effect for time is 0.58 and that
is highly statistically significant.

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,850
This would say that well, you have to be
careful here because we also have a,

42
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,080
a time squared so, so I'll look at both of
these.

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,950
There's also a highly significant time
squared term here.

44
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,710
Both of these belong to the control group.

45
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,430
But what this is saying is that there,
appears to be sort of an initial

46
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,690
positive increase but then as you saw,
that this, that this is kind of fits that

47
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,180
quadratic term, where we're going up a
little and then down quite a bit.

48
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,900
So, that corresponds to the control
group's trajectory over time.

49
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,164
It is highly significant saying that the
cognitive score is really changing over

50
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:02,030
time in both a linear and quadratic
fashion.

51
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,690
The mean effect for group is not
significant.

52
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,090
Well, this is supposed to be a randomized
trial, so

53
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,600
we would hope that at base line, they
didn't differ in cognitive score.

54
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,950
And, but the interaction between time and
the treatment group, that is highly

55
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,000
significant, and it's positive, indicating
that the treated group, the exercise group

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,769
had higher cognitive scores over time, as
we saw in the picture.

57
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,328
Now when I fit a model with a random
intercept and a random effect for time,

58
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:31,676
actually the AIC went up quite a bit, so
this was not as good of a model, and

59
00:03:31,676 --> 00:03:35,078
what you'll notice also is that a lot of
things that came out significant in

60
00:03:35,078 --> 00:03:38,110
the previous model don't come out
significant here.

61
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,050
So, a year is no longer significant the
year by treated effect is

62
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,650
no longer significant, so made a pretty
big difference.

63
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,190
We definitely didn't do as well for
whatever reason.

64
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,090
The quadratic effect's still significant
because that definitely is a nice curve.

65
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,490
I then went ahead and fit it with a random
intercept, a random effect for

66
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,946
time, and a random effect for the time
squared, because that's another within

67
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,150
subject element that we can put as a
random effect.

68
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,690
You'll notice that the AIC is actually the
best from this model.

69
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,910
So this is the model that I'm going to end
up reporting.

70
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,729
And in this model it looks very similar to
the results that I got when I

71
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:12,598
had the random intercept only.

72
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,567
I'm getting a significant effect for time,
a significant effect for

73
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:20,550
time by group, and a significant effect
for the quadratic shape of time.

74
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,240
So that seems to be the best model here.

75
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:29,022
Now the other thing that we need to
consider in adding is that, we also want

76
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:34,195
to consider whether we want to put a year
squared terms times treatment group.

77
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:37,471
What that would indicate if we put it in
the model is

78
00:04:37,471 --> 00:04:42,490
that there was a difference in the
quadratic shape between the two groups.

79
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,325
And actually the picture doesn't seem to
indicate that.

80
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,469
If you look at the picture carefully,

81
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:50,427
the blue group definitely looks higher
than the red group over time.

82
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:55,459
They're, so the linear affect over time
for, looks different but the, the shape of

83
00:04:55,459 --> 00:05:00,287
the quadratic, the shape of the curve kind
of looks similar over time and indeed when

84
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:04,435
I went ahead and set a model adding this
year squared times group effect it

85
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:08,620
didn't come out to be statistically
significant and the AIC went up.

86
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,270
So we probably wouldn't end up including
that in the model.

87
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,750
But this is just to show you that
sometimes we don't want to necessarily

88
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,470
that rates of change are linear over time
because sometimes they're not.
