1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,690
So before I show you how to analyze time
changing predictors with

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,200
generalized estimating equations, I'm
first going to show you how to graph them.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,680
So I made up a little data set just for us
to have some data to work with.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,880
For time changing predictors.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,600
So in this data set I've got just six
patients and they're all depressed and

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,590
they're all given the same drug.

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,693
Our time changing predictor here is levels
of some kind of happy chemical in

8
00:00:32,693 --> 00:00:38,420
the brain and our outcome here is scores
on a depression questionnaire.

9
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,330
So for example, subject number one they
had a score of 20 at their,

10
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,570
on depression score at base line that went
down to 18 and

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,420
then down to 15 and then popped back up to
20.

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,550
Meanwhile their ca, their levels of happy
chemical in their brain starting at

13
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,067
a thousand and increased throughout the
study.

14
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:58,371
And everybody was given a drug that's
supposed to increase that,

15
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:00,520
their happy chemical levels in the brain.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,830
So that's the data in the broad form and
of course we'll also be putting the data

17
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,510
into the long form and you can see that
here.

18
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,070
In fact the time periods were not even.

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,680
So subjects were measured at base line and
then two months into the study.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,580
And then at three months.

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,580
And then at six months.

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,400
So time is actually not one, two, three,
four, here it's zero two three six.

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,240
So how are we actually going to graph
these data.

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,840
So if you've got a continuous time change
predictor and a continuous time changing

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,120
outcome, you can actually put both of
those on the same graphic, by having one

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:42,130
on you know, one Y axis and one on a
second Y axis, as I'm showing you here.

27
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,020
So, the, I'm going to graph, both of these
against time, and

28
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,580
I want to say does the change in
depression scores,

29
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,230
does that relate to the change in chemical
levels over time.

30
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,120
And I graphed this, I only have 6
subjects, so I just graphed this to start

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,140
with, separately by subject, so here is
the first subject.

32
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,143
So, I already showed you that that
subject's depression scores started at 20.

33
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:03,430
They went down, and they went back up to
20.

34
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,020
Meanwhile, their chemical levels kind of
had a steady increase over time.

35
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,400
The chemical levels here are in red.

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,085
I made up these data, so I tried to make
up these data in a way that,

37
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:17,640
in general, as the chemical levels go up
the depression score tends to go down.

38
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,860
I then graphed subjects two and three.

39
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,300
You can see same idea.

40
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,062
So for example subject number two, the
chemical level's kind of flat and

41
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:29,000
then it goes down.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,790
While the chemical level's going down the
depression score is going up.

43
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,580
The chemical level goes up in subject
number three at the same time

44
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,870
the depression scores goes down.

45
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,440
So these are inversely.

46
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,110
They're kind of going together inversely
in each of these individual subjects.

47
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,670
That's subject four and subject five.

48
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,390
Subject four you can see this nice
progression where as chemical level goes

49
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,580
up, the depression goes down.

50
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,210
As the chemical level goes down, the
depression goes up, and so on.

51
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,486
I mean I've made up these data, so

52
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:55,090
I sort of built in that there's an
association here.

53
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,510
And finally subject number six.

54
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,870
Clearer association as the chemical level
goes up, the, in the brain,

55
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,390
the happy chemical goes up in the brain,
the depression score goes down.

56
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,922
And then we can plot these all together in
a single mean plot, and

57
00:03:06,922 --> 00:03:09,883
you can see that yeah, in general, over
time, as the,

58
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:12,767
the chemical level seems to drift upwards
over time.

59
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:16,680
It's not totally perfect, but it's seeming
to go upwards over time.

60
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,360
Meanwhile, the depression score is seeming
to go downwards over time.

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,930
So they seem to be doing something
together inversely.

62
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,394
Anyway, this is just to make the point
that you can,

63
00:03:26,394 --> 00:03:29,530
if you have a time changing predictor, put
it on the same graphic as

64
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,400
the time changing outcome as long as those
are both continuous variables.

65
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,499
