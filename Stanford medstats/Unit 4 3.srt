[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,680
This next module we're going to spend a
little bit of time talking about some of

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,450
the identified root cause analysis that's
been reported to The Joint Commission.

4
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:20,409
Joint Commission has been collecting
sentinel event data since its

5
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:26,634
late 1990s early 2000s, and what they
found that out of all the reports

6
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:31,890
614 of the cases had human factors or
fatigue or distraction involved.

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,079
We could just imagine, you know, with
people working long hours double shift.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,310
Things can occur where folks aren't
focused on what the issue or

9
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,380
task is at hand and as resl, as result
leads to an adverse outcome.

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,480
leadership.

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,830
The lack of performance improvement
infrastructure.

12
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:57,370
A lack of policy contributes to, why bad
things happen.

13
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,660
And that usually applies to a structure
and a lot of your policies actually

14
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,450
outline step by step procedures in terms
of how things needs to be done.

15
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,220
And as a result when they're not done
properly, it leads to an adverse outcome.

16
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,008
And you know, the whole intent about
policy and procedure is to create

17
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:21,320
the infrastructure or the methodology upon
what the expected practice is going to be.

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,560
Performance improvement infrastructure
that's missing actually alludes to

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,950
the fact that there is now a system place
to be able to escalate these issues.

20
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,470
To be able to identify what needs to be
addressed, and

21
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,149
then have a systematic way of addressing
those issues.

22
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,050
Communication, we often time rely on
communication,

23
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,490
not only between team members, but other
discipline.

24
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,480
But we all know that patients also are a
party in this and

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,600
especially if you're providing information
to them and

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,085
they're not following the instruction or a
patient gave you information that you

27
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:58,030
weren't aware of that was critical to
their disease process.

28
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,880
And as a result, it does, you know, these
things do lead,

29
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,960
potentially can lead to an adverse outcome
assessment.

30
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,630
Working up the patient, taking into
account all of the information from

31
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,789
diagnostic tests, lab tests, procedures,
consultations, etc.

32
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:21,680
Those are all factors been identified as,
contributing causes for

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,110
a sentinel event to occur.

34
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,034
Information management it's not uncommon
that we don't use the identifiers,

35
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:31,647
that's on the patient, on the wrist band
or,

36
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:35,399
we actually did a procedure without
checking against their ID, or

37
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:40,590
we're engaging them to tell us, you know,
their full name and date of birth.

38
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,930
All of these are things that actually can
lead to a sentinel event.

39
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,338
Physical environment we spoke about this
earlier,

40
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:51,080
how the environment may not be conducive
to.

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,040
Being able to focus on the patient when
the code alarms, when they're going off.

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,600
And you get fatigued from hearing them
going on and on and on.

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,110
Don't realize that the one alarm for

44
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,920
your patient is a true sign, symptom of a
patient having a problem.

45
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,330
Then it could be set with space.

46
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,230
There's inadequate space to be able to
check the patients armband,

47
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,680
because, you know, everyone's at the head
of the table where the armband is, and

48
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,270
trying to take care of the patient.

49
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,500
That's why some facility actually, you
know,

50
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,600
require they having an armband at the
wrist as well as a band at the ankle.

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,085
So that way the staff can actually go up
and

52
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:27,940
check without disrupting the care that's
being provided continuity care.

53
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,762
We often time know that when patient move
from one city to another.

54
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:33,170
That [UNKNOWN] carried through the
handoff.

55
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,990
The information communication from one
team to

56
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,010
another team can lead to an adverse
outcome.

57
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:45,120
Operative setting including things like
blood use and patient monitoring.

58
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,780
We notice that events occur in procedures
that are not necessarily always in an OR.

59
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,900
I mean, there are procedures that are done
at the bedside, the ICU, the ED.

60
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,680
The diagnostic area and as a result when,
system process procedures aren't

61
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,920
being followed, those things can lead to
an adverse outcome.

62
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,990
Medication just about every patient we,
treat.

63
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,200
You know, if all of a sudden use some
medication, and

64
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,060
as a result, when the medication, isn't
properly prepared,

65
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,070
administered, documented, controlled,
stored, labeled.

66
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,760
All these things are factors that can
actually cause an adverse outcome.

67
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,858
And then planning for

68
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:28,823
the care that we're providing our patient
in terms of making sure that we

69
00:04:28,823 --> 00:04:32,520
understand based on our assessment what's
going on with the patient.

70
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,050
That the plan is communicated properly to
the entire team.

71
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,480
Everyone's on the same page.

72
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,970
Everyone is of a single mindset and

73
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,700
to be able to carry our the fraction to
take care of the patient.

74
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,842
So those are the core you know, care
planning, medication use operative,

75
00:04:48,842 --> 00:04:53,741
all these things are, have been identified
as root causes that have been reported to

76
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:56,501
joint commission over the last several
years as

77
00:04:56,501 --> 00:05:01,520
factors that have been involved in causing
certain events to occur in a patient.

78
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,390
Now, what are some of the common
challenges that are facing clinicians,

79
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,320
and I'm sure you can relate to each one of
these.

80
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,290
Certainly there are production pressures.

81
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,930
To be able to see more patients, do more
procedures.

82
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,570
You know, you're trying to get a lot done
in a little bit of time.

83
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,110
When you speed things up, things happen.

84
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,445
Certainly, you are more productive, but
the question is, are you more effective.

85
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:30,010
Multi-tasking, distraction, well,

86
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,780
because of production pressure, it's not
uncommon for us to.

87
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,318
To be distracted, trying to accomplish all
those different tasks,

88
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:40,950
the multi-tasking when you're trying to do
more than one thing at the same time.

89
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,268
Yeah, you can do one or two things really
good but can you do three or four things?

90
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:48,615
It's not uncommon for us to have reports
that the wrong patient got the medication

91
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:52,647
order in place, because what had happened
is that the physician had three or

92
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:56,272
four computer screens up, open, on their
different patients.

93
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,940
And their one chart they're trying to put
an order in,

94
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,942
another chart they're trying to put a note
in, a third chart they just got a page,

95
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:06,422
and, and someone's asking questions about
another patient, so

96
00:06:06,422 --> 00:06:10,200
that's classic situation where it, you
know, inadvertently.

97
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,340
You know, with the new technology of
electronic medical records,

98
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,220
a bad thing potentially could happen for a
patient.

99
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,160
Complexities, it's also with old and new
technologies.

100
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,150
Many of us are in hybrid states, you know,

101
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:27,230
everything from robotic surgery, robotic
pharmacy, to the latest imaging gizmo.

102
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,100
And you know, sometimes, you don't know
how to use a tool.

103
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,390
Develop familiarity to understand how the
tool works.

104
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,820
The ramification of an error is pretty
great or pretty significant.

105
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:43,170
One event that we had evaluated was a
pretty

106
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,860
common procedure using a particular.

107
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,577
Device and it was interesting that the
team that was involved was setting up

108
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:53,760
the procedure, both the doctors and the
nurses weren't quite familiar with it.

109
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,440
And as a result, it took a lot longer to
do a relatively routine procedure.

110
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,600
And in the process of taking a lot longer,
they inadvertently had gone

111
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,150
through the area where they were working
through into another area.

112
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,750
The patient didn't have any serious
long-term outcome.

113
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,020
They told the patient what had happened,
but nevertheless, you know, because of

114
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,520
those new, old technology, things happen
and, and can lead to an adverse outcome.

115
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,550
Certainly communication is a factor that
has affected most of us as clinicians.

116
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,600
That were, were have expectations we
thought we

117
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,960
communicated the information properly and,
in, in, in effect we did not.

118
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,090
And as a result misunderstandings or
assumptions were made.

119
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,110
And that leading to an adverse outcome.

120
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,170
Teamwork, we rely so much on teamwork.

121
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,700
We stress teamwork but actually, do we
know our role on the team?

122
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,040
Do we participate as a team?

123
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,270
Very, very common challenge.

124
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,110
Many hospitals are struggling with the
issue of things like who's really in

125
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,720
charge of the patient.

126
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,080
As submitting doctor, are you responsible
for the patient?

127
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,120
If you have a hospice program, who's in
charge?

128
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,730
If you have a intensivist program?

129
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,800
You have a patient in the ICU, is the
intensive in charge?

130
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,007
Is the surgeons in charge?

131
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:13,139
Is the hospital that's in charge, is the
committee, committee and

132
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,433
doctors, these kind of things regarding
teamwork, adds confusion and

133
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:19,850
when you have confusion you're set up for
potential for an adverse event.

134
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,994
Then finally we talked about culture and

135
00:08:23,994 --> 00:08:28,449
culture is really the dynamics of how a
team actually works,

136
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:33,633
communicate, cooperate able to erase
issues and concerns when they do

137
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:40,008
come up without fear of getting
reprimanded or verbally abused et cetera.

138
00:08:40,008 --> 00:08:43,836
The key thing behind culture is that as
clinicians,

139
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:49,940
as physicians on a team you really do set
a foundation of how a team functions.

140
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,279
If you ask for folks to be collaborative
and you're patient and

141
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,689
willing to listen to all the viewpoints
before making decisions, I think your team

142
00:08:57,689 --> 00:09:02,200
is going to be more working with you than
passive aggressive not working with you.

143
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,756
Or not raising issues when they should, or

144
00:09:04,756 --> 00:09:09,087
flat out, you know, argumentative behavior
or disruptive behavior is

145
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:13,120
another factor that we find affects the
culture of a lot of teams.

146
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,720
These six items are common things that
faces clinicians.

147
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,378
It may not be now for you, you know, in
your particular practice, but

148
00:09:20,378 --> 00:09:24,966
somewhere down the road as dynamics change
change because of competition, health care

149
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:29,420
reform, management change, process
changes, procedure changes, you know.

150
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,530
Don't be surprised if these things are
going to pop up.

151
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,520
Now, some things we want you to beware of
when doing an, a root cause analysis,

152
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,140
are things are little danger zones or
little things you want to be aware of

153
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,520
that can pop up that can affect the
outcome of your root cause analysis.

154
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,700
Starting off with a tendency to jump to
conclusion.

155
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,350
Most of us, in health care, are really
geared at fixing things as they pop.

156
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,330
I mean, that's a knee-jerk response.

157
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,362
That's inherent, must be something in our
DNA, that causes us,

158
00:09:58,362 --> 00:10:00,162
when some problem arises, or

159
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:05,830
a situation arises for us to jump in, and
based on what we know address the issue.

160
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,330
Probably need to be a little bit more
deliberate.

161
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,650
Give the information that you're gathering
a chance to kind of mature, verify,

162
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,730
validate before you automatically come up
with your conclusions.

163
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,700
You know, one of the things about jumping
to conclusion is also at

164
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,770
the same time people like to fix the
problem.

165
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,880
So, coming up with the solutions before
the root causes or

166
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,860
contributing factors are identified is
another danger zone.

167
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,480
It's something we want you to be aware of.

168
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,330
So, just because you heard it, you figured
that's it, fix it, and move on.

169
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,180
Doesn't necessarily actually address the
problem.

170
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,080
And you'll know it because you'll end up
having the problem.

171
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,850
Problem recur itself again down the road.

172
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,810
Not having the right people in the room
it's either they're involved with

173
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:51,830
the event, management that's directly
overseeing the area where the event occur,

174
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,370
senior leadership.

175
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,710
Having, not having the right people in the
room can really effect the outcome of

176
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,150
your cause analysis.

177
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,080
Because when you don't have the right
people in the room,

178
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,640
you don't have the right information.

179
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,370
You don't have the right accountability.

180
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,760
And it certainly, you know, when it comes
to actually, following up and

181
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,480
address the issue by not having the right
people in the room,

182
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,990
you may not actually fix the problem.

183
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,330
So you need to make sure that your process
is, is set up in s-such a way that you

184
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:21,840
have the folks directly involved to
evaluate, understand what's going on.

185
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,962
That led to the problem and

186
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:26,500
then having the right people in the room
to be able to address and fix the problem.

187
00:11:27,506 --> 00:11:29,576
In some organizations like the VA,

188
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:34,145
you have a team of folks that actually do
the root cause analysis evaluation.

189
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:38,870
Pre, present the root cause as the
contributing factor to the solution.

190
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,610
They present that to the executive team at
the VA hospital and

191
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,690
the executive team then designates folks
to go out and fix the problem.

192
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,930
That's their methodology.

193
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,610
Other places actually have all the people
involved with the event,

194
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,040
as well as the leadership team together,
so that they can.

195
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,140
They could hear first hand what the
problem is, so

196
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,390
they can decide on what the solution's are
going to be.

197
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,840
Another danger is actually
under-resourcing, and

198
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,860
that's really issue of time.

199
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,510
in, in this situation, every time these
events occur,

200
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,560
this is not going to be a ten minute
huddle, and

201
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,040
we're going to figure out what the
problems are and fix it.

202
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,200
It usually involves significant amount of
energy and

203
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,500
time, to being able to drill down, figure
out what's happening.

204
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,420
To, to be able to set aside the right
amount of time to be able to drill down,

205
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,250
does require resources and a commitment.

206
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,710
In some organization, when somebody is
involved or designated.

207
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,236
To be involved in root cause analysis that
becomes their primary focus and

208
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:39,908
their primary job, even though they may be
the chief biomedical person, or

209
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:43,630
the HR person or the chief nurse or the
chief of staff.

210
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,032
You know, the key thing is is that you you
know need to allocate the amount,

211
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,830
adequate amount of time and energy.

212
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,910
Today we're going to do this right.

213
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,880
Fail to follow up or follow thru.

214
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,296
Can't tell you how many times, people go
thru this whole exercise, and

215
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:59,150
you know, roll out the solution, and
nobody follows up.

216
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,610
Up to see that the implementation or the
changes were actually put in place.

217
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,530
You can be assured that you'll probably
have the event occur again some time in

218
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,730
the near future, if you don't have follow
up or follow through.

219
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,220
All right, so, we gave you some heads up
in terms of

220
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,570
what some of the challenges are, some
things to be aware of.

221
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,760
When doing a root cause analysis, now
comin' down to the 12 easy steps to

222
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,280
doing the root cause analysis from my
standpoint.

223
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,190
So, what you want to do is quickly, after
an event occur, gather the evidence.

224
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,770
Maintain a chain of custody.

225
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,950
It could be digital photos.

226
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,820
It could be video clip, it could be the
actual materials.

227
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:43,680
It was thing like an equipment failure, or
medication, administration issue.

228
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,070
Gather a list of witnesses, and this could
be staff, patient, doctor,

229
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,520
resident, fellow, caregivers, anybody that
was in the area who might have heard or

230
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,390
seen whatever is was.

231
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,570
Was that was going on that you're trying
to verify or validate.

232
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,240
What was the event?

233
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,300
Getting a statement.

234
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,860
This either could be a handwritten
statement, an interview.

235
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,430
It could be assistant managers in the
clinic, a unit, department.

236
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,330
It could be the management.

237
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,920
It could be your Patient Safety person,
Risk Management.

238
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
It could be from the doctor.

239
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,916
But get all the, get a statement from
folks as soon as possible after the event,

240
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,908
so you can kind of recreate what the
actual event was or

241
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:21,440
understand what the issues were.

242
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,200
You need to have a process to verify or

243
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,360
validate those statements, and many times
when you you know,

244
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,130
hear the story you may have to go back and
ask the witnesses the question again.

245
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,920
What did you actually hear what'd you see,
because what you said was this.

246
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,740
And when we cleared other folks they had a
different story.

247
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,380
So you know, you need to verify, validate
the statement.

248
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,660
Take that information and to the best of
your ability recreate the event.

249
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,396
Recreating the event actually kind of
paints a picture to

250
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:50,540
everyone who's evaluating an event.

251
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,290
What was going on?

252
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,940
What was the dynamics of the team?

253
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,120
What was the communication?

254
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,514
What was the environment like?

255
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:56,800
Was the lighting good?

256
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,980
Was the, was the there was a lot of
ambient noise was it chaotic,

257
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,770
was it stressful, were there other
extenuating pressures or

258
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,820
factors contributing the event, it's
really easy to

259
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,090
assume that a nurse made a midair well
what happen what else was going on.

260
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,340
Develop a timeline.

261
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,140
And be aware, that the timeline may be one
thing for the doctor, one thing for

262
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,840
the nurse, one thing for the technician,
one thing for the medical assistant.

263
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,850
You know, if you develop a timeline, then
you probably want to think about

264
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,500
having this time, minute by minute,
segment by segment, hour by hour,.

265
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,051
Depending on what it is, in terms of the
increment of time, and

266
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:36,450
then who was doing what at what particular
time.

267
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,270
It's actually starting the process when
you're taking that timeline is

268
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:45,280
actually starting the process, developing
a little flow map, or process mapping.

269
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,990
Take advantage of your RCA tool.

270
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,570
We talked about brain storming.

271
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,750
We talked about the process mapping.

272
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,450
We talked about the fischform diagram.

273
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,210
You know, take advantage of those tools to
be able to drew down what's going on.

274
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,770
We talked about this earlier.

275
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,600
Identify your stakeholders and other
vested parties.

276
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,760
Certainly those directly involved in the
event have a vested interest in

277
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,180
knowing what's going to happen as a result
of this event.

278
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,390
And, and also don't forget your C suite
folks and

279
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,050
even in some cases your board of directors
or your governing body.

280
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,450
It has a stake in this in terms to
understand what happened,

281
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:23,734
because inevitably at that level, you're
going to be query by the media,

282
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,060
best friends, donors, other folks.

283
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,100
And then what's going to be done as a
result to this prevent it from happening.

284
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,779
The ninth step, identify the root causes
and contributing factors.

285
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,550
Develop your solutions, implement those
solutions.

286
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,610
The only way you can implement is having
the right people in the room with

287
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,160
the right authority and accountability to
make it happen.

288
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,409
And then you want to monitor the action to
make sure that those fixes,

289
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:50,488
solutions are put in placed so that event
doesn't occur again.

290
00:16:50,488 --> 00:16:52,800
So there you go.

291
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,720
We gave you the 12 easy steps for doing a
root cause analysis.
