00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,290
In this next module, I'm going to talk
about the formal types of

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,380
errors that can occur with hypothesis
tests, and directly related to that,

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,050
the concept of statistical power.

4
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,860
Lets review from last week, the steps of a
hypothesis test.

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,820
First thing that you do is to define your
null hypothesis,

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,880
that's the strong man that you want to
shoot down.

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:33,300
Once you define the null hypothesis then
you can predict the range of values for

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,000
your statistics that you expect to see
when you do an experiment if the null

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,930
hypothesis is true.

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,350
Then you got to do your experiment.

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,520
You calculate that statistic If the
statistic is within the range of

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,460
values that your expecting based on the
null hypothesis your P

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,650
value the probability of your data will
end up just a being something high in

14
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,616
other words your experiment will sort of
match, match with the null hypothesis.

15
00:00:55,616 --> 00:00:59,210
On the other hand, let's say you do the
experiment and

16
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,650
you get a value that's outside of what's
expected, based on the null hypothesis.

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,760
Then you're going to get a low p-value.

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,380
The probability of your data, or

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,338
something more extreme is going to be
small, given the null hypothesis.

20
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:14,250
If the p-value is small enough you're
going to reject the null hypothesis.

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,300
In other words your data and your null
hypothesis don't match.

22
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,110
And therefore you're not going to reject
your data, so

23
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,640
you're going to reject the null
hypothesis.

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,375
That's the steps you go through in a
hypothesis test.

25
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,550
And the underlying logic is something like
this.

26
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,800
Assuming, assume that the null hypothesis
is true.

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,260
If the null hypothesis is true,

28
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,230
then you expect to see a certain thing in
your study.

29
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,530
Lets say that you don't see that.

30
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,500
So if A then b, not b.

31
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,120
If you don't see that, then you're going
to reject your original assumption.

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,440
That's the logic of a hypothesis test.

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,150
But because we're doing statistics, we're
of course dealing always with uncertainty.

34
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,750
We have to grapple with uncertainty.

35
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,210
So now throw in a bit of uncertainty.

36
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,870
If A is true, then probably we're going to
see B.

37
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,980
If we don't see B then probably A isn't
true.

38
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,610
There's uncertainty thrown in.

39
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,650
So, at the end of the day we have to make
a binary decision.

40
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,600
We either reject the null or we don't.

41
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,090
That decision can have some errors
associated with it.

42
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,190
Let's say that there, that the null
hypothesis is true.

43
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,490
There really isn't an effect.

44
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,780
But we erroneously reject the null
hypothesis when we shouldn't,

45
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,300
that's a false positive.

46
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,380
We've made a false positive.

47
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,670
We call that a type 1 error sometimes also
called an alpha.

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,829
On the other hand let's say that the null
hypothesis is false and

49
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,710
there is actually an effect.

50
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,750
But we failed to reject the null
hypothesis.

51
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,190
That's a false negative error.

52
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,045
We call that a type 2 error it's also
known as beta.

53
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:44,650
Directly related to the type 2 error is
something called statistical power.

54
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,840
Statistical power is just the complement
of the type 2 error.

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,500
If the probabilty that is there really is
a effect.

56
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,980
If the null the hypothesis is false.

57
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,960
It's the probability that we're going to
find that effect in our study.

58
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,670
Notice that all of these have a sneakly
conditional.

59
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,740
You can only make a type 1 error is the
effect isn't real.

60
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,420
If the null hypothesis isn't true.

61
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,280
You can only make a type 2 error is the
effect is real.

62
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,740
If the null hypothesis is false.

63
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,030
Just kind of keep that in mind.

64
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,480
I think the easiest way to understand type
1 and type 2 error.

65
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,980
Used to put them in a little box, and

66
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,990
I'm going to do that in a moment, but
whenever I talk about type one and

67
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,480
type two error, it always reminds me of
something called Pascal's wager.

68
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,650
So, this is a little bit of an aside, but,
I was a philosophy major in college, and,

69
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,950
if you've ever taken a philosophy 101
class, you've probably had to read.

70
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,600
A bunch of proofs from philosophers
throughout history about either

71
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,720
the existence or non-existence of God,
plus there's a lot to think about and

72
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,970
talk about in the philosophy literature.

73
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,290
One of my favorite proofs of all the ones
I've had to read,

74
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,340
was something called Pascal's Wager.

75
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,590
And I really like it, because it's simple,
it's a simple logical, rational argument,

76
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,325
rather than these kind of long winded,
drawn out proofs that were hard to read.

77
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,710
Pascal's wager was just a rational
argument.

78
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,600
So Pascal says, there's some truth out
there, either God exists or

79
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,440
God doesn't exist.

80
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,660
One of those things is true and we can't
really ever know for sure.

81
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,530
You have to make a decision however so
it's kind of immaterial whether,

82
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,420
what the truth is since that's, you know,

83
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,850
a knowable but you have to make a decision
regardless.

84
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,300
Your decision on Earth is to either reject
God or you're going to accept God.

85
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,680
Now let's say, this is Pascal's argument:
let's say that God exists.

86
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,390
And you reject God then you've made a big
mistake right that

87
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,870
means your depending on the religion you
subscribed to your going to hell or

88
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,620
some bad very bad thing will will result
so that's a big mistake.

89
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,970
On the other hand.

90
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,500
If god exists and you accept god, then
your, you've got it right, and

91
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,650
there's some kind of big payoff.

92
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,270
Like, you're going to heaven or

93
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,440
whatever the again whatever the particular
religion you subscribe to says.

94
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,318
It's always a big, really great thing.

95
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:07,020
On the other hand, let's say that god
doesn't exist.

96
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,750
And you reject god.

97
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,230
Well, then you've got it right.

98
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,470
But the payoff maybe isn't so big, maybe
you get to live your life a little bit

99
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,050
differently, maybe the payout is not huge
there, however if God doesn't exist and

100
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,600
you accept God, then Pascal says that's
really kind of a minor mistake.

101
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,500
The cost to you of that mistake isn't so
high Because, you know,

102
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,190
maybe, you live your life a little bit
differently.

103
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,380
Maybe you go to church or

104
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,140
temple, maybe you, don't drink as much,
but he says that,

105
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,670
those costs are much more minor compared
to the other mistakes you could make.

106
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,960
And that's his sort of rational argument,
for whether or

107
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,170
not to believe in God .So I think it's
Just an interesting and fun example.

108
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,970
And, it always reminds me of type 1 and
type 2 error.

109
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,800
Because put type 1 and type 2 error in a
box.

110
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,740
So, the null hypothesis is either true or
it's false.

111
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,560
One of those things is true, and we can
never really know with complete certainty.

112
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,680
Let me just throw in an example in here,
so

113
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,640
let's say that your null hypothesis is
that the vaccine,

114
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,800
the HIV vaccine like we saw last week,
doesn't work; that's the null hypothesis.

115
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,520
So let's say that one possibility is
that's true and

116
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,520
the vaccine actually doesn't work, if the
null hypothesis is false that would

117
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,745
mean the vaccine actually does have a
biological effect.

118
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:21,690
Now you got into a study and then you have
to make a statistical decision.

119
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,960
You're either going to reject the null
hypothesis and

120
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,950
conclude that, in fact the vaccine does
work.

121
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,040
Or you're going to fail to reject the null
hypothesis.

122
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,110
If you fail to reject the null hypothesis,
you're not saying that the null hypothesis

123
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,690
is true, you're just saying that there's
insufficient evidence to reject it.

124
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,090
Notice that, that's a slightly different
thing.

125
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,190
So just kind of keep that in mind.

126
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,240
We're never proving the null hypothesis,
we're just failing to reject it.

127
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,650
So let's say that the null hypotheses is
true.

128
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,030
In fact the vaccine doesn't work.

129
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,680
But let's say that you look at the results
of the study and

130
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,420
say you see that P-value of .04 that made
it under a .05.

131
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,540
And you decide to reject the null
hypotheses, and

132
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,940
conclude that the vaccine is effective.

133
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,530
Then you've made a type one error a false
positive, and

134
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,240
we think of that error as being fairly
egregious.

135
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,810
Right because you might then, go out,

136
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,360
give people the vaccine, you might make
policy decisions,

137
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,410
you might change how you treat patients
based on rejecting a null hypothesis.

138
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,550
We tend to guard pretty stringently in the
medical literature, or

139
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,710
we're trying to, against Type I error.

140
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,430
On the other hand, let's say that the
vaccine in fact does work.

141
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,010
It has some real biological biological
effect, in other words,

142
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,660
that the null hypothesis is false.

143
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,980
But let's say you look at the results of
this study and

144
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,870
you know the P values are kind of
marginal.

145
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,180
You're not that convinced.

146
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,950
So you don't reject the null hypothesis.

147
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,720
Then you've made a Type II error.

148
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,670
A false negative error.

149
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,866
You have failed to find an effect that
actually exists.

150
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:49,130
Again, though, when you Fail to reject a
null hypothesis you're

151
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,450
just concluding that there's insufficient
evidence that the vaccine works.

152
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,270
Therefore, you might decide to keep on
studying it.

153
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,920
We tend to think of a type II therefore as
a little bit less egregious,

154
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,870
because we don't tend to change medical
treatment and change policy based on it.

155
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,925
The result of a type II error is usually
there's further study.

156
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:10,670
So in the medical literuture we tend to
set the type 1 error to be

157
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,940
more stringent than the type 2 error rate.

158
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,240
And of course there's going to be a trade
off between those 2 things.

159
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,445
So if you set the type 1 rate to be more
stringent you have to loosen the type

160
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:20,050
2 error and vice versa.

161
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,985
In the medical literature a typical a
study might have a type 1 error rate of

162
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:30,900
5% and a type 2 error of 20%.

163
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,430
Again, the type one error rate is directly
related to the significance level.

164
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,860
So this is the false positive rate.

165
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,290
The probability of finding an effect that
isn't real.

166
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:43,390
If you set the statistical significance
cut-off a p-level of less than .05.

167
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,540
So in order to be statistically
significant and reject the null.

168
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,370
You require a p-value of less than .05.

169
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,935
That means that you're permitting a false
positive rate of

170
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:56,070
5% if there's nothing going on in your
data if there are no

171
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:02,090
effects you're still expecting to see a
significant p-value one in twenty times.

172
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,708
That's the Type I error rate directly
related to the significance level.

173
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:09,030
The Type II error rate is

174
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,490
the probability of missing an effect to
get a false negative.

175
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,510
Now, we don't usually talk directly about
the Type II error in medical studies.

176
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,840
What we do instead is talk about something
that's the compliment of

177
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,400
the Type II error.

178
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,260
We talk about the statistical power.

179
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,020
So, statistical power is just the
probability of

180
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,060
finding an effect if it's there.

181
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,310
Is the probability of not making a type II
error.

182
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,760
That's usually what we talk about in, in
medical studies.

183
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,560
When we design studies a typical study
might be designed to have a power 80%, so

184
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,540
that means we're allowing a false negative
rate of type II error rate of about 20%.

185
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,720
Now that's sort of your typical study.

186
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,740
That means that we, when we go out to do
studies we're accepting that in

187
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,150
about 1 in 5 studies we're going to miss a
real effect,

188
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:58,350
when there are actually effects we're
going to miss about 1 in 5 of them.

189
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,370
Statistical power is such an important
concept in medicine/g,

190
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,380
I'm going to spend now a few more minutes
talking about it.

191
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,390
Again, statistical power is the
probability of finding and

192
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,760
effect if 1 is there.

193
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,930
It's akin, when we talk about diagnostic
testing,

194
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,520
we talked about something called
sensitivity.

195
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,830
Statistical power is just akin to
sensitivity.

196
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,170
If there is an effect,

197
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,760
it's the probability that you're actually
going to find it.

198
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,428
Finding an effect means coming out with a
significant P value at the end of the day.

199
00:10:25,428 --> 00:10:29,860
Statistical power is [UNKNOWN] if there's
an effect there, the chances, the chance

200
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,250
that you're going to end up with a
significant P value at the end of the day.

201
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,080
Your P value is going to be under 0.05, or
whatever you set the bar at.

202
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,390
So statistical power is directly related
to P-values because it's

203
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,640
the probability of getting a significant
P-value.

204
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,595
What factors affect P values?

205
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:49,570
because the same factors that affect
P-values are going to

206
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,690
affect statistical powers.

207
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,480
So let's just review from last week.

208
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,160
What affects the p-values?

209
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,980
Well there are three things that affect
the P-values.

210
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,079
Remember we were calculating either Z or T
scores.

211
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,930
When we do statistical tests.

212
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:09,080
And those were directly related to the
effect size divided by the standard error.

213
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,930
And the standard error is some com-,

214
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,272
composite of variability divided by sample
size.

215
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:18,860
It's not exactly variability divided by
sample size.

216
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,030
It's more complicated than that but in
essence the standard error has

217
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:27,260
a variability in the numerator and some
version of sample size in the denominator.

218
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,500
So, roughly our z or t square was always
proportional to the effect size divided by

219
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,120
the variability divided by the sample
size.

220
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,300
That actually puts the sample size
essentially in the numerator.

221
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,700
Bigger Z scores and bigger T scores mean
smaller P values in other words if you

222
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,190
have a bigger effect size that's going to
decrease the size of your P value because

223
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,160
its going to make you more likely to find
a stastically significant effect.

224
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,700
If your sample size is bigger,

225
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,650
you're also going to be more likely to
find a statistically significant effect.

226
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,470
However, if you have greater variability
in the, in the outcome or

227
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,640
trait you are looking at, the greater the
variability the smaller the z or

228
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,410
t value, therefore the less chance you'll
have of finding statistical significance.

229
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,540
So those are the three factors that factor
into the p-value.

230
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,450
Well since the statistical power is just
the chance that your going to find

231
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,930
a significant P value of course power is
directly related to

232
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,190
all those factors as well.
