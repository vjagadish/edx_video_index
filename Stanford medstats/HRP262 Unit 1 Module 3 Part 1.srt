[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,925
In this next module, I'm going to
introduce the Kaplan-Meier methods.

3
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:15,755
So, when we have time-to-event outcome
data, and we want to do something that is

4
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:20,620
mainly descriptive, we usually turn to the
Kaplan-Meier methods.

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,070
The nice thing about Kaplan-Meier is it
gives you these beautiful,

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,490
intuitive graphics.

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,180
And that's why you'll see a lot of
Kaplan-Meier curves in a lot of

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,870
papers that involve survival analysis.

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,020
They are mainly descriptive.

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,324
We can use them to compare groups but we
can't adjust for anything.

11
00:00:35,324 --> 00:00:41,810
So, Kaplan-Meier gives a non-parametric
estimate of the survival function.

12
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,830
And all I mean by that is we're not
going to assume any

13
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:49,470
particular smooth mathematical curve for
the survival curve.

14
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,420
We're literally just going to look at our
data and

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,430
we're going to define the survival curve
based on when events occur.

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,230
And just based on how many people survived
past different time points.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,390
So, it's the empirical probability that
what we see in

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,980
our data of surviving past certain times.

19
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,100
But the trick is that we have to somehow
account for the censoring.

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,910
It would be a really,

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,460
really easy to calculate Kaplan-Meier
estimates if there was no censoring.

22
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,059
If there's no censoring, the Kaplan-Meier
estimate just becomes the proportion of

23
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:25,420
people in your study surviving past, given
a, a different time points.

24
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,000
So, for example, if you started with 100
people and

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,830
there were 64 people surviving at age six.

26
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,371
And nobody have been lost,

27
00:01:33,371 --> 00:01:37,645
then the Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival
would just be 64%.

28
00:01:37,645 --> 00:01:39,860
That's just the percentage of people left.

29
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,513
The trick is that, accounting for

30
00:01:41,513 --> 00:01:45,720
the censoring is, makes it just slightly
more complicated than that.

31
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,020
Now, in this module,

32
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,330
I'm going to talk about just drawing a
single Kaplan-Meier curve.

33
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,540
In the next module, we'll talk about
drawing multiple Kaplan-Meier curves for

34
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,980
different groups.

35
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,990
You can get a kind of p-value test called
a log-rank

36
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,410
test to statistically compare different
Kaplan-Meier curves.

37
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,760
Again, that'll be in the next module.

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,610
Let me just start here with a really
simple example that

39
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,960
will illustrate how Kaplan-Meier curves
are drawn.

40
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,800
So, imagine that we have a study that just
has five people in the study,

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,580
really simple.

42
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,100
It's a one year study.

43
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,490
At the beginning of the study there are
five people alive.

44
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,390
And we'll say that this outcome, the
outcome in the study is death, so

45
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,679
this is a time to death study.

46
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,040
And let's say that the first thing that
happens in this study is that subject

47
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,970
E dies four months into the study.

48
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,710
That means we are going to start by
estimating the probability of

49
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,320
surviving past four months.

50
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,190
Why four months?

51
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,820
Well, that's just what happened in this
study.

52
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,620
The, the curve is only going to be defined
when events occur,

53
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,880
happen to occur in our study.

54
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,462
How we're going to represent that on our
Kaplan-Meier curve.

55
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:46,712
The Kaplan-Meier curve is going to start
at 100%,

56
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:50,200
because all five out of five are alive at
the beginning of the study.

57
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,312
We're then going to draw the curve over,
keeping it at a 100% until somebody dies,

58
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:57,080
until an event occurs.

59
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:04,290
At four months subject E dies and we're
going to drop the curve to represent that.

60
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,320
The survival probability, the probability
of surviving past four months, which is

61
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,050
what we're trying to estimate with this
Kaplan-Meier method is very easy here,

62
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,860
because we had five people who were at
risk of dying at four months.

63
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,570
One of them died, four of them survived,
so the survival probability here is

64
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,140
just going to be four out of five, 80%, so
that's really simple.

65
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,870
So we drop the curve down here now to 80%.

66
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,290
Representing that our survival probability
has now dropped.

67
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,102
Well, let's say that the next thing that
happens in our study is

68
00:03:35,102 --> 00:03:37,530
that subject A drops out of the study at
six months.

69
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,130
So, at six months, for whatever reason,
we, they were alive,

70
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,130
subject A was alive at six months, but
then they were lost to followup.

71
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,680
We don't know what happened after that.

72
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,730
So, they may or may not have died in the
last six months of the study.

73
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,000
And then, let's say, so they're said to be
censored.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,480
And then, let's say that subject C
actually has an event,

75
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,610
they die at seven months.

76
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,230
So how would we represent that on the
Kaplan-Meier curve?

77
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,530
So turning back to our curve here, we were
at 80%, at 80%, and

78
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,340
then we're going to scroll the curve over.

79
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,580
At six months, subject A drops out of the
study.

80
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,620
We represent that on the curve with a
little tick mark.

81
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,110
We're not going to drop the curve, because
nobody died, there were no events.

82
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,370
But we represent it on the curve with some
kind of little mark, saying that,

83
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,580
hey, somebody was censored.

84
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,080
That means they're no longer at risk of
having the event.

85
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,230
Then subject C dies seven months into the
study.

86
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:32,320
At the time that subject C died, there
were three people at risk of dying.

87
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,740
Why only three?

88
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,410
Well, one person died at four months, so
they're out of the risk pool.

89
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,150
And then subject A was censored at six
months, so

90
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,340
that person is also out of the risk pool.

91
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,560
So, there's actually only three people at
risk of dying at seven months.

92
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,490
Now, one person dies, two live, so

93
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,860
the chance of surviving is two out of
three, 2 3rds.

94
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,370
So, we're now going to drop the curve
down.

95
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,040
We're actually dropping the curve here
down to 53%.

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,750
I'll show you in just a second why, where
that 53% comes from.

97
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,760
But, we dropped the curve because there
was an event and

98
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,310
we are incorporating this 2 3rds
probability, of,

99
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,790
because there was 2 3rds chance of
surviving that second interval.

100
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,370
Now, let's say that subject B and D they
just survive until the end of the study.

101
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,660
So when the study terminates, they're
still alive.

102
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,390
So they're censored one year into the
study.

103
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,330
So, we're going to represent on that, that
on the Kaplan-Meier curve by just kind of

104
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,570
scrolling over the curve to the end of the
study.

105
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,710
And the curve, of course, won't drop
because nobody died.

106
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,280
So, again this is 80% are, and this is
53%.

107
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,930
So, this is a very si, simple survival
curve.

108
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,270
The probability of surviving past four
months,

109
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,570
we would represent that probability that T
is greater than four, that's equal to 80%.

110
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:53,570
The probability of surviving past seven
months is equal to 53%, and that's it.

111
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,112
So the probability of surviving past one
year, 12 months, is also equal to 53%.

112
00:05:58,112 --> 00:06:00,770
And that's our whole survival curve,

113
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,029
just defined on, at the points at which we
had events.

114
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,910
Now, let me tell you where that 53% came
from.

115
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,530
Why did I drop the curve to 53% here?

116
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,270
So, where that comes from is we have a
rule in

117
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,850
probability that says if we have
independent events,

118
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,520
their joint probability is equal to the
product of their marginal probabilities.

119
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,300
And what we're going to assume is that the
probabilities of

120
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,270
surviving different intervals are
independent of one another.

121
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,610
So, remember that four out of five people
survive the first interval and

122
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,150
two out of three people survive the second
interval.

123
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,640
So to get the cumulative, the total
probability of surviving those first two

124
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,130
intervals, we're going to multiply the 4
5ths times the 2 3rds.

125
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,968
That gives us a probability of 53.3%.

126
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:48,300
So, we're going to be multiplying across
the different intervals to

127
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,780
get the cumulative probability of
survival.

128
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,710
That's where that 53% comes from.

129
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,680
Now, notice that if nobody had been
censored,

130
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,230
if subject A had not been censored in that
second interval, we would have just been

131
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,890
multiplying 4 out of 5 times 3 out of 4,
which would just have been 3 out of 5.

132
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,030
So, then the Kaplan-Meier estimate would
be easy.

133
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,660
It would just be there was three out of
five surviving it and two people had died.

134
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,440
By changing these denominators, that's how
we're accounting for the censoring.

135
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,440
So again, it's the probability of
surviving the entire year,

136
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,670
taking into the account, the censoring,
comes out to be 53%.

137
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,530
And I just want to show you that
intuitively that's a good estimate here,

138
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,520
because imagine if we didn't know what to
do about the censor.

139
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,230
There's kind of two guesses we could make.

140
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,002
We could say, well, let's say that, you
know,

141
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:40,810
we're kind of looking at the glass half
empty.

142
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,470
And we say, well, subject A dropped out at
six months.

143
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,890
As far as I know, they're not alive.

144
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,648
So, I'm going to, I only know for sure
that B and D survived the whole year.

145
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:53,098
So, I'm only going to say that the
survival probability for

146
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,986
the year is 40%, because that's what I'm
sure of, two out of five.

147
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:58,580
So, I could be kind of pessimistic.

148
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,801
Or, I could become optimistic and I look
at the glass half full and say well, but

149
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:05,819
yeah, but the last time I saw subject A,
she was alive.

150
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,129
And so I, I'm going to assume she made it
the rest of the year.

151
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:12,849
And, I'm going to say that the chances of
surviving the year was three out of

152
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:14,800
five because we only saw two die.

153
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,950
So, I'm going to say it's 60%.

154
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,700
You can see that the 53% is kind of a nice
compromise between those two, right?

155
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,830
It's a little bit bet, somewhere between
40% and 60% and that's what we want.

156
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,930
Subject A, we have some information on
subject A.

157
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,970
We know they were alive for at least six
months, so we want to account for

158
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,765
that and incorporate it in our estimate.

159
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:36,640
40% is too small, 60% is too high.

00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,820
So that's the idea of the Kaplan-Meier
estimate and the Kaplan-Meier curve.
