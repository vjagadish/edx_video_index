1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,670
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,410
Now that we have cleaned and

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,730
repaired our data we are ready to look at
the data to find any basic patterns.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,870
Let's take a look at a histogram for the
variable age.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,780
I always like to start with goptions reset
equals all.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,240
Just to make sure that the settings used
for

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,780
the previous graphs won't get carried
over.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,220
For our histogram, we're going to use proc
sgplot.

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,700
This coach should be pretty familiar from
the section on graphing.

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,380
As you can see we have a histogram for the
variable age, with the title age in years.

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,010
Now looks like it's roughly normally
distributed.

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,180
>> It would be pretty cumbersome if we had
to repeat this code over and

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,650
over again for all the variables we
want to analyze.

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,830
So let's create a macro so we can make our
lives a little easier.

15
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,760
We'll start with the same code, just to
make sure there aren't any errors.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,720
We can then add percent macro at the top,
and percent mend at the bottom.

17
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,960
Let's name this macro histogram, and put
the parentheses after the title, so

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,899
that we create a function.

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,330
Since we're interested in multiple
histograms for

20
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,120
all continuous variables in our dataset,
we actually need a macro that allows us to

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,430
change the title and change the variable
of interest.

22
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,300
In our code, let's find the title
statement.

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,720
Instead of age, let's replace this with
ampersand title period.

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,970
Remember how in our discussions on macros,
ampersand and

25
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,660
period allow us to create a placeholder.

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,290
We need to do the same thing for age
variable.

27
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:32,320
Let's replace age with ampersand variable
period.

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,620
For both of these placeholders,

29
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,940
we need to put them in the function after
the title of our macro.

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,910
So after histogram,

31
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:43,450
we put title, variable, now we're ready to
run our macro.

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,070
>> With the macro run and stored in Sass,
we're now ready to invoke the macro.

33
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,460
Here we invoke the macro three times.

34
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,860
Remember, you always start it with % and

35
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,440
then the name of the macro, which in this
case is histogram and in the parentheses,

36
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,530
you include the values for the placeholder
variables.

37
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,680
So you start out with a title and then the
variable of interest.

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,970
Don't forget, the title has to be included
in apostrophes.

39
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,440
So first we invoke the macro for

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,830
the weight variable, then for height, then
for BMI.

41
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,630
As you can see we now have a histogram for
weight, for height, and for

42
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,270
BMI, just like we wanted.

43
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,225
Now, let's take a look at some simple
scatter plots.

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,920
Like before I'll start with G options
reset equals all.

45
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,960
By now you should be pretty familiar with
using proc gplot to make a scatterplot.

46
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,490
We'll set the title of age versus weight.

47
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,730
We'll make our labels so that we can
include our units in the access labels.

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,950
Using a plot statement we specify the
variables that we want to have in

49
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,362
the scatter plot.

50
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:52,205
We want to have age by weight so we have
age asterisk weight underscore kg's.

51
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,340
Using a simple one statement,

52
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,850
we can specify how we want our symbols to
appear in the scatter plot.

53
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,750
This will give us red triangles with a
certain height as well

54
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,640
an interpolation line.

55
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,530
As you can see, we had a scatterplot of
age by weight where

56
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,380
the symbols are red triangles and there's
an interpolation line.

57
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,550
It gives us the labels we want, as well as
the title.

58
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,610
>> [SOUND] Let's create a similar plot for
age versus BMI.

59
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,040
As you can see the first part of our code
is the same,

60
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,870
our title now is age versus BMI, and we
use our labels to

61
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,160
specify BMI in kilograms over meters
squared and age in years.

62
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,060
For axis one we specify an order zero to
50 by five.

63
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,800
This will be our BMI range.

64
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,720
We specify plot as BMI*age, and we label
our vertical axis as Axis one.

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,760
Let's take a look at the output.

66
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,680
Here you see our BMI distribution based on
age.

67
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,270
>> Let's make a slight modification to
this graph, so

68
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,022
we can see the subsets based on genders.

69
00:03:55,022 --> 00:04:00,047
[SOUND] We'll change our title, and

70
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:08,610
in the plot statement we'll add BMI*age
equals is female.

71
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,100
Now we'll get different symbols for males
and females.

72
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,880
When we add in the symbol two statement
with different settings,

73
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,330
we can have a different symbol for males
and females in our graph.

74
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,710
It looks like males have a higher BMI than
females, across all ages.

75
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,980
>> Just remember, this data is made up and
there be values that are unrealistic.

76
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,700
>> Looking to the something,

77
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,750
except show different sub sets for
diabetics and non-diabetics.

78
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:43,370
It looks like in our data set,

79
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,750
diabetics tend to have a higher BMI than
non-diabetics.

80
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,960
>> Now that we've explored our data, we're
ready to run our analysis.
