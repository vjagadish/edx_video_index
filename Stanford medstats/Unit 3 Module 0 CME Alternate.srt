2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,510
Welcome to week three of Statistics in
Medicine.

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,630
This week, I'm going to introduce you to
probability theory,

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,860
including conditional probability, and
Bayes' rule.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,940
And we're going to apply these concepts in
the clinical context of

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,050
diagnostic testing.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,510
Now, I just want to warn you that
probability is

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,080
an extremely challenging topic.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,740
In fact, my Stanford students usually find
the probability component of this course,

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,939
to be one of the most challenging parts of
the course.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,180
My goal here is just to familiarize you
with some basic concepts in probability,

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,410
and to give you the tools to be able to
calculate some simple probabilities.

13
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,130
I do not expect you to gain complete
mastery in probability through a,

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,620
a one week set of modules.

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,090
Probability is the kind of thing that you
would need to take an entire course and

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,900
do hundreds of practice problems before
you could really gain complete mastery.

17
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,880
It's that challenging.

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,500
So don't get discouraged if you find that
the material this week seems a little bit

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,250
more difficult than the previous weeks,
and

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,640
also don't get discouraged if you don't
end the week feeling like you've

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,380
got total mastery because that's really
not expected.

22
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,680
Again, I'm just hoping that you'll have a
basic familiarity with the concept of

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,320
probability and be able to calculate some
very simple probability.

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,890
If you want to delve into some more
advanced calculations, there

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,790
are a number of optional modules for you
this week if you want to delve a little

26
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,370
bit deeper into probability theory and you
find these kinds of calculations fun.

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,680
going to just start with two teasers for
this week.

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,340
So the first one is a classic statistics
problem.

29
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,720
So if you've taken a course in statistics
before,

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,870
you may have encountered this problem
previously.

31
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,550
But it's called the Monty Hall Problem and
it goes like this.

32
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,273
You're on, a game show, the Monty Hall
Gameshow, and

33
00:01:58,273 --> 00:02:02,872
your host Monty Hall shows you three
doors, and behind one of these doors is

34
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:07,342
some kind of fabulous prize like a new car
or a trip around the world.

35
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:11,192
Behind the other two doors is nothing or
some kind of booby prize.

36
00:02:11,192 --> 00:02:15,424
So, you get to pick one of the doors, and
lets say you pick door A to start with.

37
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,616
And you want to see what's behind door A,
well then Monty Hall says,

38
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:21,632
well I'm going to show you that there's
nothing behind door B.

39
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:25,740
So he shows you behind door B, so that's
no longer an option.

40
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,718
Now, he gives you the option of either
sticking with door A,

41
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:33,534
your sort of original gut feeling or
switching to door C.

42
00:02:33,534 --> 00:02:34,965
Do you want to stay with door A, or

43
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:37,960
do you want to switch to door C, you have
that option.

44
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,400
And the question here is,

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,360
should you stick with A, or should you
switch to C, or, does it not matter?

46
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,360
And in fact the answer to this one is a
little bit counter intuitive.

47
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,280
We're going to come back to this in a
couple of modules.

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,490
The second teaser for this week has to do
with the Cellulite DX test.

49
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,590
And it's a genetic test for moderate to
severe cellulite.

50
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,280
The idea is that a young woman would take
this test, and if she finds out that

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,430
she's at increased risk of moderate to
severe cellulite, she would, she could do

52
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,870
something to maybe prevent that cellulite
from developing later in her life.

53
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,430
So this company has de, has identified a
genetic variant that seems to

54
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,410
be linked to moderate to severe cellulite
in women.

55
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,240
So you can take the test, and

56
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,890
find out if you carry this genetic
variant, and here's the company's pitch in

57
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,150
terms of the information that this test is
going to give you.

58
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,340
So a patient who tests positive has
approximately a 70% chance of

59
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,730
developing moderate to severe cellulite.

60
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,739
So, so if a women tests positive that
sounds like a high probability,

61
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:41,920
she might want to then intervene and do
something about it.

62
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,660
Now, a patient who tests negative,

63
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,190
has approximately a 50% chance of not
developing moderate to sever cellulite.

64
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,329
And I think that's supposed to be
reassuring.

65
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,650
So, the question we're going to try to
answer about this genetic test is,

66
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,860
is it useful?

67
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,940
Is this information, from a positive or a
negative test, is it really useful?

68
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,720
And if you look carefully at the numbers
I've already given you,

69
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,180
you can start to really answer that
question.

70
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,970
But it turns out that it gets even a
little more interesting than

71
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,450
what I'm showing you here.

72
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,438
It's a pretty amusing example.

73
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,662
So this is something we're going to return
to in the last module for this week so,

74
00:04:17,662 --> 00:04:21,886
stick with it, get through the hard
probability stuff and the last module this

75
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:26,202
week has a pretty fun and amusing example
that you have to look forward to.
