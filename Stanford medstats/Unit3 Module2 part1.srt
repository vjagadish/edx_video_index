00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:02,900
Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,560
In this module, we are going to show you
how to use proc univariate.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,260
This procedure is useful for getting
descriptive statistics for

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,240
the columns in your data.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,320
So here, we have the basic syntax for the
proc univariate.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,960
>> Remember, you always start your code
with proc and

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,050
then the name of your procedure.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,950
Then, you must specify the data set to
work on.

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,290
Obviously, it's the heart disease data set
I imported earlier.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,450
In the next line of code,

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,780
you specify which variable you want to
perform your univariate analysis.

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,090
Remember, SAS procedures work on data one
column at a time.

13
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,060
So unless we specify something else,

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,880
SAS will run proc univariate on all of the
columns in our data set.

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,950
Let's take a look at the column for h.

16
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,135
Make sure to end your procedure with a run
statement.

17
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:45,920
[SOUND].

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,650
>> Now, let's run the code, and look at
the output.

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,100
As you can see,

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,850
SAS provides lots of information about the
distribution of your data.

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,350
Here, we have the sample size.

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,150
This is the number of non missing values
that proc univariate, was able to read for

23
00:00:59,150 --> 00:00:59,870
the age variable.

24
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,210
Here, we have the Mean, Median, and Mode.

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,620
So that you have estimates for the central
tendency of your data.

26
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,690
proc univariate also reports, the standard
deviation.

27
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,560
Variants and range so you can estimate the
spread of your data.

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,290
Down here at the bottom is some
information on

29
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,480
the various quartiles of distribution for
age.

30
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,300
>> If you wanted to look at more than one
variable, we can specify that in the code.

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,945
Let's take a look at some more columns.

32
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:26,020
[SOUND].

33
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,430
If you scroll down through the output, you
can see the results for

34
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,460
each variable we listed in the code.

35
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,410
As you can see, we first get the output
for

36
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,540
the variable age, Next we get the output
for the variable CPK.

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,216
And finally we get the output for the
variable called follow up.

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,640
It will be nice if we could visualize this
data.

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,630
Let's go back into the code.

40
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,300
Here, we had a histogram statement.

41
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,710
Now, SAS will give us a histogram of our
data.

42
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,699
The age variable looks roughly normally
distributed.

43
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:06,040
[BLANK_AUDIO]
It looks like

44
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,590
these other variables aren't really that
normal.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,090
Let's run a statistical test for

46
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,780
normality, to see if the age variable
actually falls in normal distribution.

47
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,920
As you can see, we have to specific a test
for normality and.

48
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
In the first line of code.

49
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,680
These kinds of options are pretty
[UNKNOWN] for this specific procedure.

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,490
So, I'll probably try the online test
documentation if I am not sure how

51
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,105
to enter the code.

52
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:36,770
[SOUND]
Here, the p value is greater than 0.05.

53
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,810
So, we can't reject the null hypothesis.

54
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,080
The age is normally distributed.

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,675
You'll learn about more about these Tests
of Normality in your HRP

56
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:45,130
bio-statistic courses.

57
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,030
But for now, just know that you can run
these tests using proc univariate.
