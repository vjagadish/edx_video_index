1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,701
So, in this first question of homework
two, we're presented with a table.

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:10,750
Before we tackle any other questions let's
briefly look at this table.

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,998
So, we're presented with two different
groups, the Vioxx group and

4
00:00:13,998 --> 00:00:16,030
Naproxen group.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,960
We're given the number in each group.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,550
The person years of exposure and the
number of heart attacks in each group.

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,150
Okay?

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,830
So the first question is asking us to
calculate the absolute difference in

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:34,000
incidence rates of heart attacks for Vioxx
versus Naproxen.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,780
And it wants us to put that in units of
1000 person years rounded to

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,275
one decimal place.

12
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:42,100
Okay, cool.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,932
So, what we're going to do is we're
going to treat each group separately,

14
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:45,850
okay?

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,590
So first, we're going to do Vioxx.

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,670
So to calculate, the incidence rates.

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,930
Or the, the the heart, the number of heart
attacks per 1,000 person years.

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:02,160
We're going to do 20 over 2698 times
1,000.

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,442
Okay?
And so, that's going to be 7.4 basically

20
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:16,433
heart attacks per 1,000 person years.

21
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,640
Okay and then so we're going to do the
same thing for the Naproxen group.

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,540
We're going to do 4 over 2699 times 1000.

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,880
And I'm going to write that lower here.

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,576
So that's going to give us

25
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:40,720
1.5 heart attacks per 1000 person years.

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,824
Okay and to calculate the absolute
difference all we need to do is

27
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:48,760
subtract 7.4 minus 1.5 to give us 5.9.

28
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:56,790
Okay so this is 5.9 excess heart attacks
in which group?

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,590
It's in the Vioxx group, right?

30
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,122
Okay.
So

31
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:12,290
that is the answer to the first part of
this question.

32
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,320
Moving on to the second part of this
question.

33
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,785
So the second part of this question asks
us about the absolute difference in

34
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:23,920
the risk of heart attacks for Vioxx versus
Naproxen represented as a percentage, so.

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,830
To calculate this, what I'm going to do.

36
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,895
And this actually might be more
straightforward than the first part of

37
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:28,850
this question.

38
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,866
Is just take the number of heart attacks
and

39
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:34,748
divide that by the number of people in
each group, okay.

40
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:41,887
So I'm going to do 20 over 4047 minus four
over 4029.

41
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:45,690
To get about 0.0039, which gives us 0.39%.

42
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,890
Okay, so this is the absolute difference
in the risk of heart attacks for

43
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,230
each group, and that's because this is the
probability of a heart attack in

44
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,440
the Vioxx group essentially, and this is
the.

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,215
Is the probability of a heart attack in
the Naproxen group.

46
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:07,563
The third part of this question is asking
us about a rate ratio now

47
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,601
remember whenever you see rate ratio you
think time, okay,

48
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:14,350
there's a component of time in this.

49
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,300
So, in order to do.

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,160
The, in order to calculate the rate ratio
comparing Vioxx with Naproxen.

51
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,399
Okay, what I'm going to do is take these
numbers.

52
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,075
Okay?

53
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:33,804
So, we're going to do 20 over 2698 divided
by 4 over 2699.

54
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:34,516
Okay.

55
00:03:34,516 --> 00:03:38,260
And that's, what that's going to give us
is a standardization.

56
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,355
Across the number of person years of
exposure we're standardizing against

57
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:47,040
the exposure, the number of heart attacks
in each group.

58
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,670
You can think about it like that.

59
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,140
And so the rate ratio here works out to be
5.

60
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:59,350
The last part of this question is asking
us about the number needed to harm.

61
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,510
And if you remember, the number needed to
harm can simply be calculated as

62
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,799
the reciprocal of the absolute difference
in the incidence rates.

63
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,090
Okay and so we already have that from part
A.

64
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,380
If you remember that was 5.9 events per
1000 person years.

65
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,624
So the reciprocal of this is simply going
to be 1000 divided by 5.9 and

66
00:04:22,624 --> 00:04:27,940
that's going to give us a value of 169.49.

67
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:33,664
So this is the number of patients, needed
to be treated to receive harm.

68
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:38,630
So moving onto the next question.

69
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,710
Question we're being presented with this
figure, let's take a look at this.

70
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,680
So there are three categories here a
single pill per day regimen,

71
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,495
a two pill per day regimen and a three or
more pill per day regimen.

72
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:57,145
And the these are adjusted risks of
hospitalization by each cohort okay.

73
00:04:57,145 --> 00:05:00,421
So moving on to the first part of the
questions asks is asking us

74
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:05,760
what percent of single pill users were
hospitalized during follow up.

75
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,240
Well that's easy that's given right here
at 7.7.

76
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,528
Okay, the second part of this question, is
saying what percent of three or

77
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:16,095
more pill users were hospitalized during
follow up.

78
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:19,020
Well we're just going to look at the bar
for three or more pill users.

79
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,560
And look, oh it says right there 9.9%.

80
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,100
So then the third part is asking us to
calculate the risk ratio comparing

81
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,855
the risk of hospitalization in single pill
users versus three or more pill user.

82
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:33,505
Okay so, what that's going to be,

83
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:36,475
is simply, the probability, of
hospitalization, in,

84
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:42,230
this group, divided by the probability of
hospitalization in this group.

85
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,452
Or, in other words 7.7, divided by 9.9.

86
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:49,000
Which is, 0.78.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,420
Okay.
So the risk ratio is 0.78.

88
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,378
So this next part is asking us to
calculate the odds ratio now,

89
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:01,800
of comparing the odds of hospitalization
in the single pill per day

90
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,501
regimen versus the three or more pill per
day regimen.

91
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:12,709
And so, if you remember the odds in odds
is defined as the probability over

92
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:22,520
one minus improbability so if you take 7.7
as the probability of hospitalization.

93
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,392
For the single pill per day regimen group
you can represent the odds at

94
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:32,264
7.7% over 1 minus 7.7% okay and we're
going to do that with the three or

95
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:37,540
more pill per day regimen group.

96
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,510
So it's 9.9% over 1 minus 9.9%.

97
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,070
Okay, and this is going to give us the
odds ratio.

98
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,820
So if we simplify this, we're going to get
.76.

99
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,032
The odds ratio here is .76.

100
00:06:51,032 --> 00:06:58,310
So let's take a look at this third table
presented to us here.

101
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,370
On homework two.

102
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,270
So there are two groups here.

103
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,924
There's a group that received a weight
reduction of five kilograms or

104
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:09,208
more, and then there's a group of patients
that experienced a weight reduction of

105
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,610
ten kilograms or more, okay.

106
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,130
And the authors are sort of representing
this in a strange way but, basically

107
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:21,180
notice that in this placebo group in both
categories there's 45 patients.

108
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,810
Okay?

109
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,173
So, three patients here experienced a
weight loss of greater than or

110
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:28,713
equal to ten kilograms and those three
also experienced a weight loss of

111
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:32,890
greater than or equal to five kilograms
okay.

112
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,544
So these aren't mutually exclusive,
they're just representing the data in

113
00:07:36,544 --> 00:07:41,800
different ways because they performed two
different analysis here and here.

114
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,536
And so there's a placebo group and

115
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:48,035
then there's a group of patients that were
treated with one drug.

116
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:52,139
I have three different doses at .25
milligrams .5 milligrams and

117
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,352
at one milligram.

118
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:56,864
Okay?
And odds ratios are presented for

119
00:07:56,864 --> 00:07:58,110
each group.

120
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,054
Okay, so this is of course the odds ratio,
this is the 95% confidence intervals and

121
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:06,410
this is the p value associated with this
effect estimate.

122
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,540
So now that we have all of that
understood.

123
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,610
Let's take a look at the questions.

124
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,785
The first question asks us why the authors
reported an odds ratio rather than a risk

125
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:20,670
ratio or rate ratio for these data.

126
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,134
Well, it certainly does seem strange,

127
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:27,375
given that the study was a randomized
trial.

128
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:31,148
Which does contain information to
calculate rates and

129
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:35,350
risks from their data, so the answer's not
C.

130
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:39,650
Odds ratios are not the preferred measure
of relative risk, okay?

131
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,310
The preferred measure is, of course the
risk ratio.

132
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,870
The data does not come from a case control
study,

133
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:51,130
because the stem of the question tells us
that it's a randomized trial.

134
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,222
So that leaves us with B, they analyzed
the data with a logistic regression, and

135
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:57,870
this is the correct answer.

136
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,220
The reason they used a logistic regression
was to control for confounders, okay?

137
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,137
So, you can put variables as,

138
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:09,036
into a logistic regression as independent
variables in order to adjust for

139
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:14,755
any confounding effects that you might see
in the output.

140
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,800
Of a logistic regression is an odds ratio.

141
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,310
And so the authors, just reported that
output in this table.

142
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,066
Okay.
The next part of the question,

143
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:29,298
is asking us to calculate the unadjusted
risk ratio for

144
00:09:29,298 --> 00:09:35,960
the comparison of the five kilogram weight
loss group.

145
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,740
Okay, and we're specifically looking at
the one milligram dosage of this drug.

146
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,884
So the numbers of interest to us are this
number, and this number.

147
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:50,020
So this is the one milligram dose, this is
the placebo dose.

148
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,308
That's what we want to compare.

149
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:57,440
And we want to compare it in the five
kilogram weight loss group.

150
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,094
And so to calculate the risk ratio that's
simply just going to be 91% or

151
00:10:01,094 --> 00:10:03,740
you know the probability of losing greater
than or

152
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,790
equal to 5 kilograms of [UNKNOWN] drug,
divided by 29%.

153
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:15,410
Okay, and that calculation works out to be
about 3.1.

154
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,870
So the risk ratio is approximately 3.1.

155
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,769
The next part of this question is asking
us to calculate the adjusted risk ratio,

156
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:29,630
based on this adjusted odds ratio that's
given here.

157
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:35,170
Okay, and we are provided with the
conversion formula, in the problem set.

158
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,626
So I will write that out here, so

159
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:41,050
the conversion formula's the risk ratio
equals the odds ratio.

160
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,436
Or divided by 1 minus the probability in
the reference group,

161
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:52,065
plus the probability in the reference
group times the odds ratio.

162
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:52,830
Okay.

163
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,720
So I'm just going to substitute, what we
know here.

164
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,900
We know that the odds ratio, or the
adjusted odds ratio, rather, is 31.5.

165
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,290
So let me write than in, 31.5, 31.5, okay?

166
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:11,650
And then we have this probability in the
reference group, variable.

167
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,604
And that's actually just going to be 29%.

168
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:16,829
Okay, so it's the same thing.

169
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:21,101
It's, it's we're still looking at this
category of data.

170
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:24,127
The reference group is the placebo group.

171
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:28,460
And the probability it represented by this
percentage.

172
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,720
So we're going to write that in.

173
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,932
So this is going to be 29%, 29% or 0.29
right and then, when we

174
00:11:34,932 --> 00:11:40,116
do add this calculation we see that the
adjusted, risk ratio is, is 3.2 and

175
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:49,195
of course this is the adjusted risk ratio
because we're using the adjusted RR.

176
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:52,934
To calculate this and to make this
conversion.

177
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:59,294
The last question in this homework set is
asking us what the best

178
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:08,620
way would be to represent this very large
odds ratio here, 57.7.

179
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,190
It's very rare to see odds ratios above
like 2 or 3 or something.

180
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,310
So a 57.7 odds ratio here is huge.

181
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,030
So A is incorrect, right?

182
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:25,266
Because it doesn't 57.7 is an odds so it
doesn't represent that person's chance or

183
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:31,000
probability of losing at least ten
kilograms on this drug.

184
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,860
The best answer here is C.

185
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,044
Okay the odds ratio is always misleading
it always exaggerates the effect away from

186
00:12:38,044 --> 00:12:42,100
the null when compared to the risk ratio.

187
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,999
So generally speaking it's best practice
to only report the odds ratio, if you also

188
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:53,600
give the readers or if you also report the
unadjusted or adjusted risk ratio.

189
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,160
It's really hard to understand the odds
ratio, or an odds intuitively.

190
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,260
And so, while B is technically correct.

191
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,230
It is likely to mislead most readers.

192
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,947
And the best answer here is C.
