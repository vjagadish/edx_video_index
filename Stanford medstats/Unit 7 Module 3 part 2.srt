1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:00,747
compare those [UNKNOWN].

2
00:00:00,747 --> 00:00:01,742
Here's an example.

3
00:00:01,742 --> 00:00:05,601
There was a study done on marathon runners
who is a cross sectional study.

4
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:10,450
Marathon runners tend to spend a lot of
time in the sun, so

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,490
they develop a lot of skin lesions from
sun exposure.

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,652
They develop something called nevi which
can be a precursors to melanoma, so

7
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:21,672
they're worrisome and the researchers
wanted to know whether or

8
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:26,150
not more sun would increase your nevi
that's expected.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,390
They were curious whether or not if you're
a marathon who trains more intensely,

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,130
who trains faster who trains harder for

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,140
the same amount of sun exposure if you are
more likely to develop nevi.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,720
The thought being that, somehow that
intense training is maybe going to wear

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,950
down your immunity is going to make you
more, at more risk for skin cancer.

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,750
And so, here is the results looking just
at training velocity.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,620
They grouped people according to their
training velocity a slow group a medium

16
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,160
group, and a fast group, that last group
on the right is the fastest group.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,830
Then they counted up their nevi.

18
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,570
Here are the box spots for the nevi
counts.

19
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,120
Our outcome variable here is nevi counts,

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,290
it's clearly not normally distributed
right.

21
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,160
We have very much right skewed data.

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,910
We would not expect nevi counts to be
normally distributed.

23
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,230
So how would we test whether or not those
3 groups are different?

24
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,170
Well clearly, since we have very skewed
data here,

25
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,140
we're not going to want apply a nova, our
sample size is.

26
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,250
Is reasonably small here.

27
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,020
It's 150 marathon runners, so there's,
roughly something like 50 in each group.

28
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,000
That's small enough with such skewed data
that we're going to not want to

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,030
rely on ANOVA.

30
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,090
We're going to want to use a
non-parametric test.

31
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,070
So how did I get to that, we want the
Kruskal-Wallis test.

32
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,970
I want to know whether the nevi counts
differ according to

33
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,380
training velocity group, slow, medium, or
fast.

34
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,190
My outcome variable is nevi count.

35
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,300
It is a continuous variable.

36
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:51,300
It's actually a discrete variable but you
know, it's it's a numerical variable.

37
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,750
Is it normally distributed?

38
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,000
No, it's definitely not normally
distributed and

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,250
it's also, we're also dealing with a
relatively small sample size.

40
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,410
The observations are not correlated; I
have three independent groups.

41
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,050
I have groups being compared, it's not two
groups being compared,

42
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,520
it's three groups being compared.

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,090
So that leads me to want to do the
non-parametric ANOVA,

44
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,491
which is called the Kruskal-Wallis test.

45
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:15,120
[SOUND] When the non-parametric ANOVA is
run again,

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,640
it's basically the same logistics as the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,350
I'm not going to go into it in any great
detail.

48
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,850
It involves ranking and adding up the
ranks within those groups.

49
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,795
It turns out that there is a significant
difference in

50
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:28,970
nevi count across the three groups.

51
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,610
Now remember, all an ANOVA tells you, it's
a global test, so

52
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,650
it tells you that at least one of those
groups differs.

53
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,060
It doesn't tell you which groups differ.

54
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,350
The authors went on further.

55
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,190
They wanted to know exactly where those
differences lay, however.

56
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,190
So they went on further and

57
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,450
applied the Wilcoxon rank sum test to do
the pairwise comparisons here.

58
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,000
But they adjusted for multiple
comparisons.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,850
They adjusted for the fact that they were
then doing three tests.

60
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,490
And it turns out that they could show that
the lowest velocity, the slowest group,

61
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:05,074
differed [INAUDIBLE] significantly from
the fasted group, in terms of Nevi counts.
