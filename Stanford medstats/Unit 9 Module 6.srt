1
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,140
In this next module, I'm going to talk
about the problem of residual confounding.

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,830
And this is a problem that applies to any
regression model.

3
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,950
So not just Cox regression but

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,220
also logistic regression, linear
regression any of the other types of

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,700
regression that we're actually not talking
about in this course.

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,910
So, it's a general problem for regression.

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,650
It comes up when you have observational
studies and

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,575
you try to adjust for confounding.

9
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:36,660
People sometimes will look at a paper and
they say, oh well, they adjusted for

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,300
smoking, they adjusted for alcohol, check,
check, check.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,710
great, all the confounders are taken care
of completely,

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,750
we don't have to worry about them.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,490
But in fact, statistical jar, adjustment
is not a panacea.

14
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:53,520
You often will have some left over or what
we call Residual confounding.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,460
And this comes about, simply because,
imagine when we measure variables,

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,500
when we measure the predictor and the
confounder and the outcomes.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,580
We're measuring all of those variables
with error.

18
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,080
So, when we go in and

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,050
mathematically adjust for these different
confounders, we can only adjust to

20
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,340
the extent that we've measured these
variables correctly without error.

21
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,350
And of course, there's always going to be
some error there.

22
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,640
Just think about the way we might adjust
for smoking.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,700
You put in the model, smoker, non-smoker
and you say,

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,505
oh, I've adjusted for confounding by
smoking.

25
00:01:22,505 --> 00:01:26,550
But, of course, among the group of
smokers,

26
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,180
there may be a wide variety of, in terms
of how much people smoke.

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,550
So, there may be some additional
confounding due to the fact that smokers

28
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,910
contains a lot of different types of
smokers.

29
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,260
And even in that nonsmoking group, you may
have some ex smokers.

30
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,480
So, there's all sorts of noise there,
that's going to prevent you

31
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,546
from being able to perfectly statistically
adjust away all confounding.

32
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:52,518
So again, residual confounding is just
this idea that you can not completely wipe

33
00:01:52,518 --> 00:01:56,300
out confounding, simply by adjusting for
the variables and multiple regressions.

34
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,200
Always keep in mind there is going to be
some leftover confounding.

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,020
And I love to use this example to
illustrate residual confounding.

36
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,140
This was a 2009 study that looked at meat
eating and mortality.

37
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,130
And it's actually really a credit to the
authors that I use this example so

38
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,340
much, because they happen to be, you know,
full disclosure.

39
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,070
Put a lot of information in their paper
that allows you

40
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,231
to actually really see the residual
confounding well.

41
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:27,100
I've actually shown you the table from
table one

42
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,498
from this study a couple of times now.

43
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:32,910
So, I'm just going to briefly review what
you're seeing here.

44
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,540
I love this table, because it's just such
a good example,

45
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,020
a good illustration of how it is that risk
factors cluster.

46
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,540
And, and why confounding is such a problem
for observational studies.

47
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,450
So, what you're looking at here, is they
divided the study subjects,

48
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,470
these are just the men from the study,
into quintiles of red meat eating.

49
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,690
So, Q1 is the lowest quintile, Q5 is the
highest quintile of red meat eating.

50
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:02,710
And if you look at all of the lifestyle
factors that can affect your,

51
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,030
your risk of death and cancer,

52
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,560
they just seem to all get worse as you go
across those different quintiles.

53
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,950
So, for example, BMI goes up as you go
from Q1 up to Q5.

54
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,725
Smoking goes up, as you go across the
quintiles of red meat eating.

55
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:19,640
Education goes down.

56
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,280
Physical activity goes down.

57
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,750
Healthy eating goes down.

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,290
This is just to say that people who eat a
red,

59
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,930
a lot of red meat have lots of other
unhealthy habits in their life.

60
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:41,070
So, when you try to isolate what is the
effect of red meat only on death,

61
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,670
death and death from different causes,
it's actually really hard to do it.

62
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,410
It's hard to isolate that one risk from
all of these other things that go

63
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,340
along with being a red meat eater.

64
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,710
That's the authors did attempt to isolate
the effect of red meat.

65
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,010
And they did it with a multivariate
regression, with a Cox regression in fact,

66
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,470
because the outcome here was time to
death.

67
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,340
Time to death by different causes.

68
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm not going to show you the the table
that shows the hazard ratio.

69
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,960
This is [UNKNOWN] good practice at looking
at hazard ratios.

70
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,250
And I'm going to walk you through this
table, because this is rather big.

71
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,160
So, first of all again, what's the
predictor here?

72
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,850
The predictor is the quintiles of red meat
eating.

73
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:28,110
So Q1 is the lowest quintile, and we're
going up to Q2 second, third, fourth.

74
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,200
And Q5 is the, those are the highest red
meat eaters.

75
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,020
They first look at the outcome of just
death overall.

76
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,010
And they treated these quintiles as a
categorical predictor.

77
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,580
So, there's actually, they're dummy coded,
so

78
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,020
we're going to get a separate estimate for

79
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,310
each of these quintiles, a separate hazard
ratio.

80
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,710
If you look at the basic model,

81
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,210
the reference group is the lowest red meat
eaters.

82
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,930
If you look at the basic model,

83
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:57,060
what you can see is that death seems to go
up as you go across the quintiles.

84
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,020
Now, this is not adjusted for anything,
but you see, it's really nicely going up.

85
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,160
Probably not so

86
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,045
surprising given that all those bad habits
went up as you went across the quintiles.

87
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:12,810
The P-value for trend here is
statistically significant.

88
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,400
And this P-value for trend is something
you're going to see in the literature, so

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,560
I want to briefly say how they got that
P-value.

90
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,330
So, this is a single P-value that's trying
to get at whether or

91
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,120
not there's an increase as you go across
the quintiles,

92
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,280
an increase in the rate of death.

93
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,360
So, all they do to get this P-value for

94
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,690
trend is that in the they run across
regression model.

95
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,080
And what they put in the model is a single
beta.

96
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,060
And the x variable here is a variable
that's a numeric variable: one, two,

97
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,730
three, four, five.

98
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,770
So, they take those quintiles,

99
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,040
and they code them as an ordinal variable:
one, two, three, four, five.

100
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,800
And then they put that set of numbers as a
predictor in the model.

101
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,280
They're putting in only a single beta,
meaning they are not treating it as, as,

102
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,040
as separate dummy variable.

103
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,810
So, they're allowing just a single, what's
the increase in risk as you

104
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,220
go from one to two, two to three, three to
four and four to five.

105
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,640
And the idea is that, that the key value
for

106
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,760
that beta comes out to be statistically
significant as it does here,

107
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,190
that there's some increase as you go
across the ordered category.

108
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,760
That's the idea of a P value [UNKNOWN].

109
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,880
We are seeing that here.

110
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,670
What's interesting is that the next line
shows you the adjusted models.

111
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,961
So you'll see that the risk, especially in
the quartile four, quart,

112
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:26,550
quarter, in quintile four and quintile
five the when you adjust it,

113
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,570
it doesn't attenuate the hazard ratios to
some extent.

114
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,350
Now, there is some increased risk
[UNKNOWN] where 1.21 and 1.31 here, but

115
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,780
there's some attenuation.

116
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,406
So that's suggesting that when you adjust
for

117
00:06:38,406 --> 00:06:41,890
confounders, you are attenuating the risk,
so there is some confounding going on.

118
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:45,348
What gets even more interesting is when
you look at the cause,

119
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:48,640
specific mortality rates.

120
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,830
So here, next thing that we're looking at
here is cancer mortality, so

121
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,390
they're only looking at deaths from
cancer.

122
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,450
So again, quintalize the reference group.

123
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,544
As you go across the different quintiles
of red meat eating indeed,

124
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:03,800
your hazard ratio for cancer is going up,
and the p value for trend is significant.

125
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,130
So, I'm just going to focus now on
quintile 5,

126
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,440
because those are the really risky ones,
the ones eating the most red meat.

127
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,514
So the hazard ratio here is 1.44.

128
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,480
And this is the unadjusted model.

129
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,149
So, that's saying that there's a 44%
increase in the mortality rate for

130
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:20,397
those in quintile 5 compared with those in
quintile 1.

131
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:22,476
It is statistically signficant.

132
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:25,633
Now, when they adjust for all those things
like BMI,

133
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:29,520
smoking, all the bad things that red meat
eaters do, you can see that there's

134
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,270
a great attenuation of the risk,
[INAUDIBLE] goes from 1.44 down to 1.22.

135
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,810
Now, it remains statistically significant.

136
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,760
It remains elevated, right?

137
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,740
The confidence interval here does not
cross one.

138
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:42,970
So it looks like,

139
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,910
oh well, we adjusted for all those
confounders, and we still found something.

140
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,710
So there's, there's still an increased
risk.

141
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,790
And you kind of check off the box, we
adjusted for smoking, we adjusted for BMI.

142
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,510
So, and something still remains.

143
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,950
So, therefore, red meat eating is the
cause.

144
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,940
Well, okay.

145
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,310
Let's keep going, though.

146
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:00,820
Okay.
So

147
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,150
now, we get down this to cardiovascular
mortality, same idea.

148
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,090
You start at 1.44, it's statistically
significant.

149
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,755
You adjust for things,

150
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:11,740
it goes down to 1.27, still statistically
significant; still elevated.

151
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,100
Alright, but here is the real interesting
one.

152
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,880
You go to the next set of lines here.

153
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,410
Mortality from injuries and sudden deaths.

154
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,610
Okay, so what, what is this category here?

155
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,930
This is people who died from essentially
car accidents, gun fights,

156
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,520
these kinds of things.

157
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,200
And you know, random injuries and sudden
death.

158
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,710
It's very hard to make a causal story of
how red meat eating could

159
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:41,940
cause you to have a higher risk of
injuries or sudden deaths, right.

160
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,638
There's no reason that eating red meat
should cause you to have a car accident.

161
00:08:46,638 --> 00:08:51,666
Okay, so we're not expecting, this is
almost like a control outcome here.

162
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:56,480
We're not expecting any association here
between red meat eating and

163
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,610
mortality from injuries and sudden death.

164
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,280
But let's look at the results, so you look
across at the results.

165
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,263
So, first let's start with the unadjusted,
the unadjusted hazard ratio.

166
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:05,284
Wait a minute.

167
00:09:05,284 --> 00:09:08,320
It is elevated 1.24 and statistically
significant.

168
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,090
And you adjust and

169
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,220
it actually doesn't change much, 1.26 and
statistically significant.

170
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,860
So wait a minute.

171
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,590
What's happening here?

172
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,744
We have the, how do you interpret this
1.26.

173
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:22,380
There's a 26% increase in the rate of
deaths from injuries and sudden

174
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,200
death in the heaviest red meat eaters
compared with the lowest red meat eaters.

175
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,810
This can not be causal, right?

176
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,765
This has to be due to confounding.

177
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:35,850
People who eat a lot of red meat have
riskier behaviors, they are risk takers.

178
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,120
Therefore, there is an increase in, in in
the risk of death from these causes, but

179
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,830
it's certainly not due to the red meat
eating.

180
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,460
It's got to be due to confounding.

181
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,375
Well, guess what [LAUGH], the magnitude of
the hazard ratio here,

182
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:53,740
1.26 is the basically the same as the
hazard ratio we got from cancer mortality,

183
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,560
which was 1.22 and from cardiovascular
disease which was 1.27.

184
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,560
That implies to me that the 1.22 and the
1.27 for cancer and

185
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,170
cardiovascular disease are also likely to
be due simply to residual confounding.

186
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,125
We can't adjust away all the effects of
smoking and

187
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,150
BMI, and all of those things that cluster
with red meat eating.

188
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:20,090
So, I think this is just a really great
example of residual confounding,

189
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,780
cause you can see the residual confounding
in that mortality from injuries and

190
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,080
sudden deaths category.

191
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,910
The one good thing about residual
confounding is,

192
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,690
it's usually pretty contained.

193
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,790
That is that, you worry about residual
confounding when you

194
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:39,180
have very moderate and small elevations in
risk.

195
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,050
So the relative risks would usually that
if they're just due

196
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,830
to residual confounding, spurious effect
due to

197
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,710
residual confounding are usually going to
be in the range of 0.6 to 1.6.

198
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,130
And people have tried to model this and

199
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,310
kind of say well, how, how much effect,
how bad can the residual confounding be?

200
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,120
Well, there's really no relationship.

201
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,600
You might get relative risks all the way
down to 0.6.

202
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,790
Or maybe all the way up to 1.6, just
purely by residual confounding.

203
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,700
But it's hard to get much bigger than
that, if you know, if you've adjusted for

204
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,984
the things, and your, you,

205
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:14,630
you've, you have some error, it, it can
make errors in that kind of range.

206
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,260
But your not going get, we're not worried
about getting the relative risk of

207
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,160
like two or three just do to residual
confounding usually.

208
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,800
Now, what we notice here is of course that
in this case what were our hazard ratios,

209
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,370
they were like 1.22, 1.27, so they were
totally within that range.

210
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,220
So, when you're talking about these kind
of moderate size relative risks,

211
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,660
that's where you start to think hm,

212
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,420
they're kind of moderate size could this
be due to residual confounding?

213
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,920
And one last thing to keep in mind is that
usually we think about confounding,

214
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,380
sort of creating these spurious
associations, but

215
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,430
confounding can also obscure
relationships.

216
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,740
And similarly, residual confounding can
also obscure relationships.

217
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,860
So, sometimes you may fail to find an
effect because of residual confounding.

218
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,660
And those examples are harder to detect
because you,

219
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,090
you know you just don't see anything.

220
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,980
But keep in the back of your mind that
residual confounding can

221
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:11,909
also obscure relationships leading
researchers to miss associations.
