1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,610
In this next module, I'm going to talk
about an important,

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,130
discrete probability distribution called
the binomial distribution.

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,870
It has widespread applications in
statistics .

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,500
So the binomial probability comes up in
lots of different scenarios.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,420
It's a particular situation where you have
a fixed number of trials and

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,250
we'll call that n trials.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,056
So like 15 tosses of a coin or

8
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:35,030
20 patients or 1000 people surveyed, but
there's a fixed number.

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,120
You're also dealing with a binary outcome.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,370
So in each of those trials there are only
two possible outcomes.

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,555
Such as heads or tails, or disease or no
disease.

12
00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:46,530
And we're going to call the probability of
one of those outcomes p,

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,810
and the probability of the other outcome 1
minus p.

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,870
The other thing that has to be true for

15
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:58,110
the binomial probability distribution to
apply is each trial, each coin toss, or

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,310
patient, or person surveyed, has to have
the same probability.

17
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,540
Of getting a success or failure as
everybody else.

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,460
So there's a -- every single trial had the
exact same probabilities, like when you

19
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,090
toss a coin, every time you toss a coin
you have a .5 chance of getting a heads.

20
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,930
So that's the scenario we're talking about
when we're talking about

21
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,179
the binomial distribution.

22
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,300
Now some of you may have encountered the
binomial probability distribution before,

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,290
and you may have been given a formula and

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,110
told how to plug into this formula to
calculate binomial probabilities.

25
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,910
Well, I hate to just give you a formula
without any reasoning behind it.

26
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,840
So what I want to do now is kind of walk
you through the logic,

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,490
build up to that formula, so that you have
some sense of where it comes from.

28
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,008
So that hopefully if you ever forgot the
formula you could just derive it yourself.

29
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:48,470
So we're going to start with a simple
example to build towards figuring out

30
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,610
the binomial probability formula.

31
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,340
Take the example of five coin tosses.

32
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,420
If I ask you, in five coin tosses,

33
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,838
what's the probability that you flip
exactly three heads in five coin tosses.

34
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:03,210
Calculate that probability.

35
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,590
Well, this is an example of a binomial
distribution.

36
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,750
We have 5 coin tosses.

37
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,980
So our n, in this case, is 5.

38
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,470
Each coin toss is an independent trial.

39
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,050
Each coin toss has the some probability of
success of a heads, .5.

40
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,200
And the same probability of a failure, a
tails.

41
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,950
So this is a binomial distribution.

42
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,620
But how would you calculate that
probability using some of

43
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,950
the tools that we learned last week?

44
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,460
What's the probability that you flip
exactly three heads?

45
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,480
And I want to know the probability of
exactly three heads.

46
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,330
So, not two, not one, not four.

47
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,550
But exactly three.

48
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,640
So how could we solve this?

49
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,770
So let's just kind of walk through how we
could solve this.

50
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,920
How we could approach this problem.

51
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,300
So, first of all you could just think
about okay,

52
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,170
here's one way to get exactly 3 heads.

53
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,770
You might flip a heads, and

54
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,190
another heads, and another heads, and then
a tails and a tails.

55
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,140
That's one way to get exactly three heads.

56
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,310
Well, what's the probability of that
particular outcome?

57
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,920
We can calculate that, right?

58
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,180
What's the probability that you get a
heads on the first toss,

59
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,760
a heads on the second toss, a heads on the
third, and then two tails?

60
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,520
Well, it's going to be 0.5 times 0.5 times
0.5,

61
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,390
those are the probabilities of getting
three heads in a row.

62
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,000
And then you have to get two tails in a
row, so that's another 0.5 times 0.5.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,430
So it ends up being 0.5 raised to the
fifth.

64
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,750
That's the probability of getting exactly
3 heads in that particular arrangement,

65
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,885
where we're considering order.

66
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:24,880
3 heads first, and then 2 tails.

67
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,695
Now's the probability of that exact
arrangement.

68
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:30,790
All right, well, what if we think about
another possible arrangement?

69
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,000
Another way we can get 3 heads in 5 coin
tosses.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,080
There's another way we could get it.

71
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,850
We could get tails, and then 3 heads, and
then a tails.

72
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,030
Well what's the probability of that exact
arrangement?

73
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,320
Well it's going to be again, the
probability of tails,

74
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,300
times the probability of heads, times the
probability of heads,

75
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,190
times the probability of heads, times the
probability of tails.

76
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,090
Again, it's going to be 0.05 times 5
raised the the 5th.

77
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,100
In fact, if you write out any exact
arrangement where you've got two tails and

78
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,980
three heads in a particular order, the
probability of any particular order is

79
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,650
going to be 0.5 raised to the third times
0.5 raised to the second.

80
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,880
In other words, the probability of a heads
raised to the third, because we're

81
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,420
getting three heads, times the probability
of a tails, raised to the second.

82
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,910
Well that solves the probability of any
particular exact arrangement and

83
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,990
then all we have to answer is how many
possible arrangements are there.

84
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:26,429
How many possible ways can we arrange 3
heads in a string of 5 letters,

85
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:29,799
3 each is in a string of 5 letters.

86
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,320
So.

87
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,828
Overall the probability of 3 heads and
tails is 1 half raised to the fifth.

88
00:04:35,828 --> 00:04:39,390
For every unique arrangement how many
unique arrangements are there?

89
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,220
Well one way to solve this would actually
just be to write them out in this case.

90
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,360
There's not that many in this case so we
could write them out systemically.

91
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,810
So I actually went through and did that.

92
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,520
So one way to get 3 heads is tails, heads,
heads, heads, tails.

93
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,930
Another way is heads, heads.

94
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,720
Heads tails tails another way's tails
tails heads heads heads and

95
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,920
I just I systematically sat there and
wrote them all out each one of

96
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,420
those exact arrangements has the
probability 1 half raised to the 3rd

97
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,440
times 1 half raised to the second or the
probability of heads raised to the 3rd.

98
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,960
And the probability of tails raised to the
second.

99
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,950
Now, wouldn't it be nice, though, if there
were a neat and tidy way to come up

100
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:20,460
with the number of arrangements, other
than just writing them out systematically.

101
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,120
In fact, it turns out there is.

102
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,770
You can view this problem as a
combinations problem, a choosing problem.

103
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,640
And we can apply the choosing function
here.

104
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,200
So the way you need to think about it, is,
you think.

105
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,956
Okay, I've got 5 [UNKNOWN], 5 tosses and I
have to give any 3 of them to heads.

106
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,005
By default the other 2 will be tails.
So I have to choose

107
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:43,620
3

108
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,770
spots out of 5 to give to heads, the other
2 spots will be tails.

109
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,512
So it's actually a 5 choose 3.

110
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:56,270
There are 5 choose 3 ways to arrange 3
heads in 5 trials.

111
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,530
So we can just apply the choosing
function, the combinations function here.

112
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,390
If you apply that here, it comes out to
give us a value of 10,

113
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,440
exactly the number that I dealt when I
wrote them out systematically.

114
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,990
So that turns out the probability of
getting exactly three heads turns out to

115
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:17,390
be 10 times one half 3 to to the 5th or
31.25%.

116
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,760
We can actually calculate all possible
outcomes when you toss a coin five times.

117
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,630
What are all possible outcomes?

118
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,540
Well you can get 0 heads, 1 head, 2, 3, 4
or 5 and

119
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,460
we can calculate the probability of all of
those.

120
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,900
And that's what I've done here using the
same logic in that

121
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,890
probability distribution looks like this,
although those areas, if you add them up,

122
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,902
will add up to 1.

123
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:44,740
Now, let's extent the problem just a
little bit.

124
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,830
Let's extend the problem to the ase where
it's a little bit less simple because we

125
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,530
now have uneven probability, so
probability of a success and

126
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,620
failure are no longer equal.

127
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,850
So here's a particular example.

128
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,680
As voters exit the polls, you ask a very
small but representative random sample of

129
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,660
six voters if they voted for a particular
proporsition.

130
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,285
Let's say that the true percentage of
voters who voted for that proposition is

131
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:15,940
55.1%, so the probability that any random
person has voted for it is 55.1%.

132
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,580
What's the probability that in your sample
of six exactly two voted for

133
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,060
the proposition and four did not?

134
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,730
So let's use the same logic to solve for
this probability.

135
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,040
Well, we can write out all the possible
outcomes.

136
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,800
We could get two yes votes.

137
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,110
The first two people we talk to could say
that they voted yes on the proposition,

138
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,270
and the next four could say no.

139
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,523
That's one way to get exactly two yes
votes.

140
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:48,190
The probability of a yes is now .551, the
probability of a no is .449, 1 minus .551.

141
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,340
We have to get 2 yeses in a row and then 4
nos in a row, so

142
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,950
that's .551 raised to the 2, 2nd times
.449 raised to the 4th.

143
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,920
Well, what's another way to get exactly 2
yeses?

144
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,050
Well I could get no and then yes, yes.

145
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,400
And then no, no, no.

146
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,200
And again, that's, you're going to see
that,

147
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,070
that comes out to just 0.551 raised to the
second, 0.449 raised to the fourth.

148
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,710
No matter what particular outcome I write
out,

149
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,180
they all have the exact same probability.

150
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,190
How many possible outcomes are there?

151
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:23,740
How many possible ways is there to arrange
two yes votes in six trials?

152
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,890
Well, that's a six choose two problem
again.

153
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,160
There are six choose two ways to arrange
two yes votes among the six voters.

154
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,120
So six choose two, if we calculated it
out, turns out to be 15.

155
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,537
And how did I get that, again, to apply
the choosing function?

156
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:41,870
Six choose two.

157
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,822
Is just equal to 6 factorial divided by 2
factorial divided by 6

158
00:08:46,822 --> 00:08:49,490
minus 2 factorial or 4 factorial.

159
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:55,140
If you do that out that's going to be 6
times 5 times 4 factorial.

160
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,930
I'm writing it this way because I know I
can cancel the 4 factorial in

161
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,636
the denominator.

162
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:00,100
2 factorial's just 2.

163
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,050
So these cancel.

164
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,180
That turns out to be 30 divided by 2 or
15.

165
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:10,030
So there are 15 ways To get exactly two
yes votes and four no, no votes.

166
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:15,400
There's cer, there's 15 arrangements and
the probability of each arrangement we've,

167
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,920
we've calculated here so we're just
going to multiply that probability by 15.

168
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,110
Now you might start to notice a general
pattern emerging here, right?

169
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,150
We have a choosing function in the front.

170
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,610
And then we've got the probability of
success,

171
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,990
raised to the number of successes, and

172
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,200
the probability of failures, raised to the
number of failures.

173
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,650
So this is now going to generalize into
our general formula for

174
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,920
calculating binomial probabilities.

175
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,610
This, by the way comes out to be 18.5%, if
you calculated it all out.

176
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,680
If you want the final answer.

177
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,340
So here's our general binomial formula.

178
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:59,030
If you've got a binomial distribution that
is n trial, independent trials,

179
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,760
each trial has a probability of success p
and a probability of failure 1 minus p,

180
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,480
then the probability of getting exactly X
successes, like exactly Three heads or

181
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,710
exactly two yes voters is the following: n
choose X,

182
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,530
the probability of success raised to the
number of successes, raised to X, times

183
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:23,340
times probability of failure raised to n
minus X, that is, the number of failures.

184
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,055
So again, n is the number of trials.

185
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:28,020
That defines that binomial distribution.

186
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,000
X is the particular probability that
you're trying to calculate.

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,415
What is the probability of getting exactly
x successes out of those n trials?

188
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:36,930
1 minus p is the probability of failure.

189
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,460
p is the probability of success.

190
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,100
So if you can reason through and

191
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,500
understand where this formula comes from,
I think it makes sense.

192
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,800
And then you can, once you know where this
formula comes from then you can apply this

193
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,900
formula to calculate probabilities
whenever you have a binomial distribution.

194
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,380
And you'll get good at these if you
practice a lot of them.

195
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,419
Let's do some practice problems.
