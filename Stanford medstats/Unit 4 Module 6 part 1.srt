1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,584
In this next module, I'm going to to talk
about

2
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:14,096
the normal approximation to the binomial.

3
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:16,046
So whenever you have a binomial
distribution,

4
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:18,996
you might have noticed in the earlier
modules that a lot of the binomial

5
00:00:18,996 --> 00:00:21,346
distributions when you do out all the
probabilities and

6
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:26,114
you plot them, they look an awful lot like
a normal distribution.

7
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:28,340
So it turns out that as long as you're on
a binomial,

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,785
where n times p is greater than 5, that
is, the expected value is greater than 5,

9
00:00:31,785 --> 00:00:35,725
it usually looks an awful lot like a
normal.

10
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:37,650
And we can approximate that binomial,

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,030
those binomial probabilities, with a
normal distribution.

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,400
Let me just remind you of some of the
examples that we saw.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,260
So for example, we saw this one in the
upper left hand

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,210
right corner was the wrinkle study, n here
was 10 patients, P was 0.5.

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,910
That, get, exactly gives us an np of five.

16
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,880
And p times p is equal to five, hey,

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,000
that looks pretty much like a normal curve
to me.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,080
Right?
That's very close to

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,120
a normal curve of course with jagged
edges, but still very close, and,

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,750
and n times p is justified there.

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:12,240
When we flipped a coin a 100 times, n
times p [SOUND] was equal to 50.

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,760
And that one very much looks like a normal
curve.

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,110
When we flipped a coin just 5 times, n was
just 5 and p was just 0.5, so

24
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,090
this one is n times p is less than 5.

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,470
But it still looks kind of like a normal
curve, and this one over here,

26
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:30,290
we had eight cases, and n equals 8, nrp
was 0.6.

27
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:35,110
So n times p was 4.8, is a little less
than 5, but it still looks kind of close

28
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,420
to a normal, so we're able to pretend,
essentially, that we're on a normal curve,

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,620
and calculate probabilities as if we're on
a normal curve.

30
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,710
What's the mean and the variance of that
normal curve going to be?

31
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,680
Well, it's just going to be the mean and
the variance of the binomial.

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,900
So the, it's going to be n times p will be
the mean of the normal curve,

33
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,180
n times p times 1 minus p will be the
variance.

34
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,790
So we can literally just view it as a
normal curve, that normal curve will have

35
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,430
a mean of n times p and a variance of n
time p times 1 minus p.

36
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,350
So let's just do a little practice problem
to illustrate this.

37
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,190
So let's say you're doing a cohort study
and

38
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,890
the probability of developing disease in
the exposed group is 25%.

39
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,940
Let's say you sample 500 exposed people,
and you want to make sure that

40
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,370
you're going to get enough people that
develop the disease.

41
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,600
So you might want to know things, like,
what's the probability that I'm going to

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,420
get at most 120 people developing the
disease?

43
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,150
Well, we're on a binomial, this is a
binomial.

44
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,550
Each person, there's 500 people,

45
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,210
each person has a 25% chance of developing
the disease.

46
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,790
Am I going to get enough cases of disease,
or

47
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,460
could it be, could that I get 100, less
than 120 or 120 or less?

48
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,720
Well, the way to solve this, once you
recognize it's another binomial,

49
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,730
would be to calculate the exact binomial
probabilities of

50
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,570
getting all the way up to 120.

51
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,350
That would mean the probability of getting
zero cases of disease, one or

52
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,570
two or three, you have to go through,

53
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:59,230
and by hand, calculate each one of those
individual binomial probabilities.

54
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,870
Well, that's extremely tedious and

55
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,320
of course you're never going to want to do
that by hand.

56
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,470
Of course, a computer could also do it for
you nowadays.

57
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,610
But in general we, we're just going to
avoid that and

58
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,100
instead we're going to say well hey I'm
close enough to a normal curve.

59
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,384
So, let's just pretend we're on a normal
curve with a mean of 125.

60
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:20,640
That's 500 times a quarter.

61
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,400
And a standard deviation of the square
root of n times p times 1

62
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,613
minus p here is 9.68.

63
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:28,910
[SOUND] So, I take the standard deviation
and

64
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,100
the mean from the binomial, and I pretend
I'm on a normal.

65
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,740
And now, if I want to know what's the
chance of getting 120 or

66
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,810
less, well that's the, the area to the
left on the normal curve, of 120.

67
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,610
Now that's below the mean, so we know that
that area's going to be less than 50%.

68
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,690
I calculate my z score.

69
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,220
It turns out to be negative 0.52.

70
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,792
I go to my chart, I look up the
probability to the left of negative 0.52.

71
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:53,710
It's about 30%.

72
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:58,270
So I have a 30% chance of getting 120
cases more or less.

73
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,380
So rather than having to calculate all of
those individual binomial probabilities,

74
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,080
I can just look at it as normal.

75
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,800
And it turns out that that normal
approximation underlies a lot of

76
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,139
the statistics that we're going to be
talking about later in the course.
