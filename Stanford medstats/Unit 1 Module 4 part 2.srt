1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:06,510
Finally you often get the question in my
descriptive table one in my paper.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,980
Should I present the means or should I
present the medians?

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,690
Well you'll see if you read a lot of the
medical literature,

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,260
that most people go with the means.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,530
I think most people feel very comfortable
with the means.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,530
That's what they're typically used to
seeing.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,110
So a lot of authors will present means.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,960
It turns out, however, there are cases, a
lot of cases, actually,

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,745
where it would be better to report the
median.

10
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:31,550
Because if you have skewed data, if you
have extreme values,

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,690
as we've seen, those extreme values can
influence, can affect the mean,

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,590
and so the mean might be misleading.

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,900
Where as the median doesn't get affected
by those extreme values.

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,770
So the median might be a better
representation in that case of

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,630
the center of the data.

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,730
So let me just illustrate that.

17
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,020
I'm going to harken back now to one of the
teasers that I

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,430
presented at the beginning of this week.

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,020
I had presented some hypothetical data.

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,080
About a, a randomized trial on diets.

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,575
So that we had,

22
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:07,207
20 dieters who were randomly assigned to
follow one of two diets.

23
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:09,150
Let's call them diet one and diet two.

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,210
Again, these are hypothetical data, made
to illustrate a point.

25
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,030
But, they're still interesting.

26
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,850
So, it turns out, here is the results of
that trial, as I mentioned in the teaser.

27
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,946
So group one, those on diet one, lost an
average of 34.5 pounds.

28
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:27,180
Group two lost an average of 18.5 pounds.

29
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,660
So both dieting groups were highly
successful,

30
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,620
these are really good results for a
dieting trial.

31
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,850
But if you were just to look at those
numbers, you'd probably say oh well,

32
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,030
if I've got patients and I want to figure
out what diet to put them on,

33
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,431
based on these numbers I think I'm
going to put them on diet one.

34
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:45,520
Diet one looks better right, if you just
look at the means.

35
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,000
Is diet one better, however?

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,490
Well, let's dig down deeper into the data
to answer that question.

37
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,070
So, here's the histogram.

38
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,900
I'm going to start with diet two.

39
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,290
Here's the histogram of the weight loss
from the ten dieters in diet two.

40
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,690
So, as I mentioned the mean was 18.5
pounds, an 18.5 pound loss of weight.

41
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,100
The median was a weight loss of 19 pounds
and

42
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,510
if you graph it on the histogram you can
see that they're pretty well clustered,

43
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,960
everybody's losing some amount of weight
and there the variability isn't very high.

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,890
Now let's turn to the histogram for diet
one.

45
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,760
Okay, you can see that this is made up
data, but, you know,

46
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,710
this could really happen.

47
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,010
So here's the histogram from diet one so
what do you notice so.

48
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,430
The mean is weight loss of 34.5 pounds.

49
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,980
But, the median is only a weight loss of
4.5 pounds.

50
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,200
And of course, the reason is,

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,320
is that we have this extreme value out at
negative 300.

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,103
Somebody was very highly successful on
this diet, and lost 300 pounds.

53
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:49,280
That 300, that negative 300.

54
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,520
When you average it in with the other nine
values, has a huge influence on the mean;

55
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,710
it completely draws the mean to the right,
and it's a, it's misleading, right?

56
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,200
It makes the mean look much bigger.

57
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,510
The median here is really a better
representation,

58
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,350
because most people weren't losing
anywhere near 30 pounds.

59
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,776
Most people were losing four or five
pounds.

60
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:10,552
Let me just show you the raw data.

61
00:03:10,552 --> 00:03:11,854
Cause there's only ten data points in each
group so

62
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:13,336
I can actually show you the raw data.

63
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,462
So here's the raw data from diet one.

64
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,143
Here are the weight losses for diet one.

65
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:20,835
And I've ordered them from the the least
weight loss to the most weight loss.

66
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:23,653
For diet two you can see the same thing.

67
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,813
Here are the weight loss, the raw weight
loss values.

68
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:27,751
Now, if you look at the raw data like
this,

69
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:32,498
you suddenly get a different feeling for
diet one versus diet two, right.

70
00:03:32,498 --> 00:03:34,949
If you're looking at this raw data, you
might change your mind now and

71
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,970
actually want to recommend diet two for
your patients.

72
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,146
because what you can see is that on diet
one,

73
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:44,380
one out of ten people lost a huge amount
of weight.

74
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,152
But everybody else's weight loss was non
existent or

75
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:51,760
moderate, whereas in diet two, everybody
was highly successful.

76
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,596
Everybody lost a good amount of weight so

77
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:58,201
it was a very, you know, you could see
that it was successful for everybody.

78
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:03,663
So it changes your opinion when you see
all of the data like that, now.

79
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:09,740
When you're actually going to analyze this
data, to run a formal statistical test.

80
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,960
We haven't talked about any formal
statistical tests and

81
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,400
we won't get there for another couple of
weeks.

82
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,090
But the way that your, your instinct might
be to compare those

83
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:24,410
groups by just comparing the means, the
345.5 versus the 18.5 pound weight loss.

84
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,340
If you did that,

85
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,760
you would compare those two means with a
test that we called a T-Test.

86
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,880
Some of you may of heard of.

87
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,050
If you do that you will find.

88
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,670
That there is no significant difference
between the groups.

89
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,650
So what you need to compare in this case
is not the means but

90
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,300
you need to compare the medians.

91
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,100
You need to compare the data using a
ranked data procedure something called

92
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,650
a non-parametric test.

93
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,930
And don't worry to much about this
terminology right now we're going to

94
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,800
talk a lot about non-parametric tests in a
future week.

95
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,700
But some of you may have heard that term
before.

96
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,990
So this is an example,

97
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,320
what I'm going to show you now is an
example of a non-parametric test.

98
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,310
That just means that we're going to be
ranking the,

99
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,680
the data and running tests on the ranks of
the data rather than the raw values.

100
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,970
And it's, the tests that I'm actually
going to run now I'm going to tell you

101
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,770
the name of it only because it has a very
informative name.

102
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,090
It's something called the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test and don't worry about

103
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,160
the details of that yet, we'll return to
that test in another couple of weeks but

104
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,520
it's very easy to figure out what the test
does because it is a rank-sum test.

105
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
So literally we're going to rank the data
and

106
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,650
then we're going to sum the data and that
part is easy to understand without knowing

107
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,410
anything about non-parametric tests so
we're going to do that.

108
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,800
We can do that right now.

109
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,710
So let's rank the data.

110
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,810
So what do I mean by ranking the data?

111
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,720
So what we're going to do, is we're
going to order the data from the lowest

112
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,610
weight loss, the, the worst weight loss to
the highest, the best weight loss.

113
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,770
And for the moment,

114
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,925
we're going to rank the data ignoring
which group people are in.

115
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:52,100
So, there are 20 people here.

116
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,250
The person who lost the least weight,

117
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,240
which was the person who gained four
pounds.

118
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,890
They're going to get a rank of one.

119
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,530
The person who lost the most weight, which
was the person who was

120
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,280
just did really well and lost 300 pounds,
they're going to get a rank of 20.

121
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,240
And we're going to rank everybody in
between.

122
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,040
And again, for the moment we're ignorning
diet.

123
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,750
So, you can see that most of the low ranks
go to diet one.

124
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,370
The, the six lowest ranks go to diet one.

125
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,960
The sixth lowest person lost only five
pounds, and then we jump to diet two.

126
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,569
The eight pound weight loss in diet two
was the seventh lowest.

127
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:27,740
And then the negative ten, the ten pound
weight loss was the eighth, and

128
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,110
then we jump back to diet one to get the
ninth rank, and so on.

129
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,620
So you can see, that now we're treating
everything rather than using

130
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,820
the underlying values like the negative
300, which is so highly influential.

131
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,180
We're giving everybody a rate, and

132
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,580
the rate values you can see everybody is
only one unit apart.

133
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,520
So that's going to have less influence on
the statistics.

134
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,680
Notice, however though, that we did not
take that 300 pound weight loss and

135
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,760
throw it out, that would be a mistake,
because there really is

136
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,700
somebody who did have a fabulous success
on diet one for whatever reason.

137
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,680
That person gets counted, they get the
best rate, they get the 20, but

138
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,560
that, that the 20 has much less influence
on the statistics than that negative 300,

139
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,400
that's the idea.

140
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,790
So we ranked everybody from 1 to 20,
ignoring which group you're in.

141
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,810
And then, we sum up the ranks within each
of those groups,

142
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,050
we just add them up, literally sum them
up.

143
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,860
So, we take the ranks from diet one and we
add them up,

144
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,370
we come up with a sum of the ranks of 73,
do the same thing with diet two,

145
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,496
we come up with a sum of the ranks of 137.

146
00:07:28,496 --> 00:07:34,160
Notice that 137 is much bigger than 73,.

147
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,970
Where we need the official, the formal
Wilcoxon sum-rank test is to

148
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,790
actually say whether or not that 137
versus that 73.

149
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,090
Whether that's a different set, could have
arisen by chance or

150
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,280
does that represent likely a real
difference between those diets.

151
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,510
And so when we actually apply the formal
Wilcoxon sum-rank test,

152
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,970
something we're going to learn in a few
weeks, to say whether or

153
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:58,790
not 137 is really different than 73, in
fact, we get a significant p-value here.

154
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,620
So, in fact, when you apply the correct
statistical test here,

155
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,010
you find out that diet two is
significantly better than diet one.

156
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,760
Exactly the opposite of what you might
have concluded if you had

157
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,870
just looked at the means.
