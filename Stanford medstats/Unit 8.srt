1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,730
In the fourth scenario,

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:13,060
we're dealing with an elderly patient
presenting to the emergency department.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,010
This actually could be an emergency
department, it could be a clinic.

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,780
With a history of alcoholism, acute
pancreatitis.

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,860
Atrial fibrillation, degenerate joint
disease of spine and

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,610
both lower extremities, history of deep
venous thrombosis,

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,310
intermittent homelessness and multiple
previous hospitalization.

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:36,769
Upon past medical history, medications the
patient said

9
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:41,610
that they were taking warfarin, mini-dose
aspirin,

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,230
ibuprofen, naproxsyn sodium, and loves
garlic.

11
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,930
It turns out that all five of those
medications were prescribed by

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,500
different doctors.

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,950
So, based on this kind of history,

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,440
what do you think the patient actually
presented the emergency department with?

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,490
And, you guessed it.

16
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,400
It was a gastrointestinal bleed.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,062
Pretty severe.

18
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:10,550
Patient actually was being provided care
in the same care

19
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:16,808
system by several different specialties
and clinics and doctors.

20
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:20,396
And it's interesting they were using the
same comprehensive electronic medical

21
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:22,320
system that crossed the entire continuum,

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,070
both the emergency department, inpatient,
outpatient.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,772
And, it was interesting that when the
doctors that were involved in the case

24
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:37,144
were actually interviewed, they actually
never reviewed, or reconciled, or

25
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:42,250
assessed the medication that's being
prescribed by the other providers.

26
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,000
So, factors that were identified in this
particular event.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,650
You probably guessed it.

28
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:54,540
The need to review medication prior to
adding, deleting or changing medications.

29
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,960
The need to do a pause or a timeout to
make sure we're dealing with,

30
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,354
knowing what the medications the patient's
on,

31
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:04,380
that we're ordering, prescribing the right
thing for the patient.

32
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,980
There's always could be factors of
fatigue,

33
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,530
distraction, production pressures.

34
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,911
Variation in work processes, staff
training, communication, teamwork, and

35
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,038
certainly, the culture,

36
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:17,160
especially if you have multiple
individuals taking care of this patient.

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,040
In this particular scenario,

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,080
lessons learned included National Patient
Safety Goal has a requirement that says,

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,750
gathering of medication information upon
entry into a healthcare setting.

40
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,280
This information should be used whenever
there is an addition, deletion, or

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,530
modification in the patient's medication
regimen.

42
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:44,720
Certainly use the electronic medical
record to assist with information

43
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,010
gathering or confirmation and the second
part of the national patient safety goal.

44
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,120
There's another element there that also
requires that the patient and

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,030
or care providers are educated about the
medication that they are taking.

46
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,884
We suspect that if the patient was aware
that

47
00:03:01,884 --> 00:03:08,720
these different medication can affect the
patient's ability to coagulate.

48
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,030
It's real possible that they could have
prevented the event from occurring.

49
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,090
And, not sure if I mentioned, but in this
particular case,

50
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,250
the patient did survive, the visit to the
emergency department.

51
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,352
And subsequent of that, made their point
to let their,

52
00:03:26,352 --> 00:03:30,972
his doctor know regarding medications that
he's taken to have it double checked to

53
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:35,060
make sure it's not going to effect his
potential bleeding status.
