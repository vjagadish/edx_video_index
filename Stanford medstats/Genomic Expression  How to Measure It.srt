00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:02,460
Hello, students.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,310
We're going to learn about how to measure
gene expression on a massive scale.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,550
We will learn about two methods, DNA
microarrays and RNA sequencing.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,030
So let's get started.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,750
The first topic will be DNA microarrays.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,710
These measure gene expression across the
genome.

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,800
They consist of arrays of microscopic
spots containing DNA probes for

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
every gene in the genome.

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:30,070
The first thing to do is to manufacture a
whole bunch

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,280
of these microarrays which can be used
over and over again.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,220
And what you do in the manufacturing
process is you take DNA probes and

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,470
you attach them to a solid support.

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,370
So as a result, each gene will have a
specific location.

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,820
Or, if you want redundancy, multiple
locations.

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,170
The strategy of DNA microarrays exploits
our knowledge of the entire sequence for

16
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:56,870
the human genome.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,360
In the second step you take the RNA sample
and

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,610
you label it with say, a fluorescent dye.

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,390
And the RNA sample is very

20
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,680
complicated with many kinds of RNA, but if
there is a spot on the solid

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,940
support that will hybridize to that RNA
sample, it will, you'll get hybridization,

22
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,740
of the labeled RNA and allow that spot to
light up.

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,900
And each spot here,

24
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,900
you'll, this is an example here of what a
microarray would look like.

25
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,670
Each spot reveals the level of expression
for a specific gene.

26
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,840
And under the microscope here, there's a
blow up, you can see that each

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,965
spot is lighting up to a different extent
depending on the level of expression.

28
00:01:56,965 --> 00:02:01,248
[COUGH] And you get huge amounts of data.

29
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:09,564
[SOUND]
Okay.

30
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:18,210
So, now that you have a snapshot of my,
DNA macroarrays let's move on.

31
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,120
And talk about RNA-Seq or RNA sequencing
concept.

32
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,990
Now in RNA sequencing, you end up

33
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,210
revealing a snapshot of that part of the
genome that's transcribed.

34
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,138
There are a whole bunch of different kinds
of RNAs in the cell.

35
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:37,720
There are microRNAs, and

36
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,960
I'm going to draw all of the RNAs as
little, short wiggly lines.

37
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,849
So the microRNAs would be these short
wiggly lines, and

38
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:50,258
you have messenger RNAs, which.

39
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:56,445
[SOUND] Are longer and have poly A tails.

40
00:02:56,445 --> 00:03:03,761
[SOUND] And finally you have ribosomal
RNAs,

41
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:11,689
which are the most abundant RNAs in the
genome.

42
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:16,810
And so I'm going to draw many, many wiggly
lines to indicate that.

43
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,940
The microRNAs are involved in gene
regulation.

44
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,120
The messenger RNAs, are involved in code
proteins.

45
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,280
And the ribosomal RNAs are part of the
translational machinery

46
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,920
that decodes the messenger RNAs.

47
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,620
So, what you want to do if your

48
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,120
interested in studying these things, is
you might want to isolate them.

49
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,620
For example, if your particularly
interested in microRNAs,

50
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,670
you would do a size selection and select
for the small RNAs in the mixture.

51
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:55,415
So you end up with a pool of microRNAs.

52
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:59,230
And then the next step is to use pi
throughput or

53
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,930
next generation sequencing methods to
sequence all the microRNAs.

54
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,260
How do you do that?

55
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,480
Well first you have to convert the
microRNAs into DNA and

56
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,880
you need a, a known sequence to get
started.

57
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:20,560
So, first, you get oligonucleotides,

58
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,270
or n oligonucleotide with a known
sequence.

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,088
And then, you get RNA ligase.

60
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:44,433
[SOUND] To attach these oligos of a known
sequence

61
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:52,790
to the three prime end of each of the
microRNAs.

62
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:02,130
And in step three, you anneal a
complementary oligonucleotide primer.

63
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,460
And the fourth step you add reverse
transcriptase, or

64
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:24,450
RT, to make a complimentary copy of the
microRNAs.

65
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,620
Extending the primers.

66
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,990
What about the messenger RNAs?

67
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,760
Well in the messenger RNAs you do what's
called oligo-T selection.

68
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,652
You have strings of Ts attached to beads,
and

69
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:49,163
what you do there is, first you take the
sample and

70
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:52,899
you hybridize to the beads.

71
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:56,945
And the species that hybridize to

72
00:05:56,945 --> 00:06:02,615
the beads will be those RNAs with poly A
tails.

73
00:06:02,615 --> 00:06:08,222
[SOUND] And in the second step,

74
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:15,410
you add reverse transcriptase or RT.

75
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,360
And you end up making a CD make copy.

76
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,112
With the messenger RNAs.

77
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:31,503
[BLANK_AUDIO]

78
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:33,910
Now.

79
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,260
What do you do now?

80
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,050
Well, now you use next generation
sequencing to sequence all of

81
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,440
these species, so lets concentrate on, for
now on the messenger RNAs.

82
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,560
So, these are the sequence leads you'd get
from RNA-Seq.

83
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,208
Here's a example of a gene.

84
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:56,583
And this gene, of course,

85
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:04,073
has exons in tan and introns in black.

86
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:05,246
Okay.

87
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:10,523
And the, when the gene is transcribed into
a pre-RNA it

88
00:07:10,523 --> 00:07:14,575
gets spliced into a mature messenger RNA.

89
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:17,166
And then using the methods we just
described,

90
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,455
you can get short sequence reads off of
the messenger RNA.

91
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:27,143
[NOISE] And, what I'm showing you in red
here,

92
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:32,118
in this microscopic image, are,

93
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:38,141
are reeds, sequence reeds, that span.

94
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:41,525
[SOUND] Two exons.

95
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:49,445
[NOISE] And, they define, splicing events.

96
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:59,000
[NOISE]

97
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,615
So, let's summarize what we've talked
about.

98
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:09,565
[NOISE] For DNA micro arrays, we've

99
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:18,310
exploited the human genome sequence.

100
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:32,012
And we measure.

101
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:40,461
[SOUND]
Genomyte expression.

102
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:47,275
[SOUND] And for RNA-Seq methods, RNA
sequencing methods.

103
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:54,250
[SOUND]
We also exploit.

104
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,915
The human genome sequence.

105
00:08:55,915 --> 00:09:01,570
[SOUND]
But

106
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:11,220
with the added exploitation of next
generation sequencing.

107
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,660
We also measure genome expression.

108
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,530
Because the more sequence reads we have
from a particular gene,

109
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,920
the higher the level of expression.

110
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:45,110
But in addition to that, we can find new
RNAs, unexpected surprises.

111
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,590
So there you have it, class.

112
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,428
Measuring expression across the entire
genome.

113
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:51,617
Thank you.

114
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:53,999
