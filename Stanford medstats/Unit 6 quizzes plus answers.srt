1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,180
The answer to this question is true.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,096
You can only make a type II error, which
is a false negative error,

3
00:00:06,096 --> 00:00:08,730
when the null hypothesis is false.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,825
The correct answer is B.

5
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:16,353
Statistical power is the probability of
getting a statistically significant result

6
00:00:16,353 --> 00:00:18,900
when the null hypothesis is false.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,522
Statistical power is the probability of
detecting a real effect, or

8
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,130
rejecting a null hypothesis when you
should.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:29,410
Out of the options that we have for this
question, the only element that does not

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:37,310
increase statistical power is increasing
the significance level from 0.05 to 0.01.

11
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,638
It is harder to achieve a significance
level of 0.01 does a statistical power

12
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:43,862
will actually go down if we reduce the
statistical significance from 0.05

13
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:45,734
to 0.01.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,930
This question has a sample size of a
100,000 children.

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,960
Now because the sample size is so very
high, we cannot safely say that we

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,280
have actually found a correlation between
blood sugar and IQ.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,350
Even though the p value is very small.

18
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,230
P values tend to become smaller as we
increase the sample size.

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,826
So we should, we should find out the
actual size of the effect before we

20
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:15,412
make any strong statements of the
correlation between blood sugar and IQ.

21
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:20,410
In this case we had researchers who ran 50
statistical tests.

22
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,060
And we would expect to get at least two or

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,790
three tests which have p values less than
.05 just by chance.

24
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,800
That's the fact that we have these two
significant p

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,160
values isn't a very strong statement.

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,970
It's just likely a reflection of chance
rather than a finding of true effect.

27
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,378
In this question we have researchers who
found that women who take,

28
00:01:39,378 --> 00:01:43,136
who took a particular drug, x, had a
significant increase in bone density.

29
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:48,729
But women who took a drug y did not have a
significant increase in bone density.

30
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:51,065
The correct answer here is B.

31
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:53,135
The fact that the p value is significant
in one group but

32
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:57,230
not the other does not tell us whether the
two groups differ significantly.

33
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,887
It also does not guarantee that the effect
is bigger in the drug x group because p

34
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:06,070
values depend on the effect size, the
variability, and the sample size as well.

35
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,982
The question here,

36
00:02:06,982 --> 00:02:11,029
has researchers who attempted to determine
whether babies who are exposed to x-ray,

37
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:16,303
while in the womb have an increase risk of
certain childhood cancers.

38
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:20,920
We see that the odds ratios comes out to
be 2.44.

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,908
The confidence interval is 0.95 to 6.33
and

40
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:28,220
the p value is actually greater than 0.05.

41
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,620
Failure to find statistically significant
result may reflect a lack of

42
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,590
statistical power than the lack of an
effect.

43
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,568
Thus we should pay more attention to the
effect size and

44
00:02:35,568 --> 00:02:38,263
confidence interval rather than to the p
value.

45
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:41,154
Both myeloid leukemia and inutero X-rays
are rare events,

46
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:46,140
thus the statistical power for this
association was likely to be very low.

47
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,522
The correct answer just turns out to be B.

48
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:52,694
Out of the five options given in this
question, the only two for

49
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:56,730
which we have correlated observations are
c and e.

50
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,783
In c, we are,

51
00:02:57,783 --> 00:03:05,152
comparing the pre-treatment with the post
treatment values of certain patients.

52
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,276
And these are obviously correlated because
we're looking at the same patient before

53
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:10,260
and after treatment.

54
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,392
And E has a group of cases where we were
looking at sibling controls and

55
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:17,334
these are again, these again would tend to
be correlated because the siblings would

56
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:20,629
share some genetic information.
