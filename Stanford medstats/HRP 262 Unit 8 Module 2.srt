[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,610
In this next module,

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,880
I'm going to show you how to analyze
time-independent predictors, that is,

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,130
predictors that don't change over time,
using generalized estimating equations.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,710
So first of all, what do I mean by a
time-independent predictor?

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,490
So you can probably guess what that is,
but the easiest way to see it.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,230
To see what a time interdependent
predictor is,

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,272
is to just look at the long form of the
data.

9
00:00:27,272 --> 00:00:29,890
As I've got in this box over here.

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,900
If your predictor of interest has the same
value for every time point.

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,960
Within an individual then that is a time
independent predictor.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,310
It is not changing over time.

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,390
So for example, I've been using the spine
bone density example.

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,650
Here's a person, ID number one.

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,180
Her bone density, her outcome is changing
over time.

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,110
Her time value is changing over time.

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,630
But her group, which group she's in,

18
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,250
whether black, blue or red, is the same at
every time point.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,080
So you can see it in the data set.

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,980
If her group were to change then that
would be a time changing predictor.

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,000
Of course the case of time independent
predictors is easier so

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,320
we're going to start there.

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,680
So, in this data set, I had actually
grouped women into whether or

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,250
not they got their periods back or didn't
and these are static groups.

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,060
I didn't allow the groups to change over
time.

26
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,720
I've shown you these pictures before the
red group and

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,750
the black group improve more that the blue
group over time.

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,930
You've already seen that.

29
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,100
I now want to fit a GEE model to these
data.

30
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,600
So what's the model that we're going to
fit?

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,070
So my outcome here is bone density.

32
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,850
I'm going to have an intercept in this
model.

33
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,170
I'm essentially fitting a linear model.

34
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,540
My model is going to have very similar to
what we had in

35
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,640
the repeated measures ANOVA, it's going to
have time in it.

36
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,520
That represents a time effect.

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,090
It's going to have a variable for the main
effect for which group you're in.

38
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,460
And essentially like the group effect in
repeated measures ANOVA.

39
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,210
And then you have to interact any
variables,

40
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,250
any time independent variables that you're
interested in seeing.

41
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,530
What their effect is on the change in bone
density over time,

42
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,330
you have to put an interaction with those
variables, with time into the model.

43
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,300
And you have to remember to put that in.

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,410
So for, when we're talking about
time-independent predictors,

45
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,550
you must include an interaction term with
time if you want to

46
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,740
get it within subjects effect.

47
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,830
That is if you want to see what's the
effect of group on the changes over time.

48
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,820
And usually that's what we care about so
that's the model that I fit to these data.

49
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,060
And let me just show you the results.

50
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,140
I chose an exchangeable correlation matrix
to start with because I've

51
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,760
already looked at the correlation matrix
for these data.

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,200
And either exchangeable or autoregressive,
when we just had time in the model,

53
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,340
both of those seemed to do, pretty close
to one another.

54
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,120
So we just started with the simpler one,
the exchangeable correlation matrix.

55
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,410
So it's the same data set,

56
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,730
that I showed you in the last module,
where I was showing you that we have,

57
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,650
indeed, significant changes in bone
density over time.

58
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,200
Now we want to see whether that differs by
which of these groups you're in.

59
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,290
So I'm going to just walk you though, how
to interpret all of these coefficients.

60
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,300
All of these parameters from the model.

61
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,040
So starting with the intercept, what does
the intercept represent here?

62
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,990
So the reference group, I've chosen the
reference group to be the blue group.

63
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,060
They are the ones that had the lowest bone
density and the lowest bone

64
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,640
density changes over time, so it just made
sense to make them the reference group.

65
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,970
The intercept of course represents when
everything else in the model is

66
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,950
set to zero.

67
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,750
So, because we have time in the model that
mean that

68
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,590
the intercept represents a base line value
when time is equal to zero.

69
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,400
The intercept also represents the
reference group for

70
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,390
all the group variables so it's
representing the blue group.

71
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,840
So the intercept represents the value for

72
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,220
the spine bone density for the blue group
at baseline.

73
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,720
So if you remember from last week, the
blue group actually started with

74
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,350
a little bit lower bone density than the
other two groups.

75
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,120
It was right around 0.93.

76
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,910
So that's the baseline average spine bone
density in the blue group.

77
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,580
And that's highly significant.

78
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,960
All that means that it's highly
significant is that they didn't have

79
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,350
a bone density of zero which clearly we
wouldn't expect that.

80
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,880
Obviously they're going to have a bone
density something other than zero.

81
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:21,680
Alright, then we get to the time
coefficient, the parameter for time here.

82
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,270
The time effect from the GE model has a
slightly different interpretation than

83
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,390
the time effect that we saw with the
repeated measures ANOVA.

84
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,700
What the time effect represents here, is
the time effect for the blue group.

85
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,330
This is the change over time,

86
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,780
the rate of change in bone density over
time, for only the blue group.

87
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,840
If you'll remember from the ANOVA.

88
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,200
The time effect in the repeated measures
ANOVA was sort of an average of the change

89
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,740
in time for all the groups.

90
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,800
So, that's not the case with the
regression.

91
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,880
With the regression this is just the time
effect for the blue group, this is

92
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,320
representing the rate in change in spine
bone density over time for the blue group.

93
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,630
Now we know if you saw the picture, go
back to the picture,

94
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,160
they basically were pretty static over
time, they basically kind of stayed flat,

95
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,150
they went down a little and went back up a
little back.

96
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,946
We're assuming a line, we're fitting
lines, so

97
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,590
if we fit a line to those data that I just
showed you.

98
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,550
We're going to get something around a rate
of change of zero which is exactly

99
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,120
what we get here.

100
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,311
The rate of change is essentially zero.

101
00:05:22,311 --> 00:05:24,768
It the p value is totally non-significant.

102
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:27,080
That tells you that the rate of change for

103
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,980
the blue group in spine bone density does
not differ from zero.

104
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,770
Well, clearly we can see that from the
picture they stayed right about the same.

105
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,990
Alright, so that's the time effect from a
GEE model.

106
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,110
Then we get to the group effect.

107
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,460
And there's two groups here: the black
group and the red group.

108
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,990
And again, this is being compared to the
reference group of, of blue.

109
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,630
So what does the main effect for the black
group and

110
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,190
the main effect for the red group?

111
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,730
This is akin to the group effect from
repeated measures ANOVA.

112
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,020
But they mean, again, something slightly
different than what

113
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,260
the group effect meant in repeated
measures ANOVA.

114
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,750
So if you remember from repeated measure
ANOVA,

115
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,970
the group effect was sort of an average
across all time periods.

116
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,010
Across all time periods is the black group
greater than the blue group for example.

117
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,620
In generalized estimating equations in the
regression model,

118
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,510
the groups effects only, are only
pertinent to base line.

119
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,370
So when time is equal to zero.

120
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,830
When everything else set in the model is,
is set to zero.

121
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,170
You're going to bring in the interaction
effects once your time is

122
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,480
something other than zero.

123
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,120
So, the main effect for group in the GEE
model is

124
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,640
the difference at baseline between the
black group and the reference group, and

125
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,740
the red group and the reference group.

126
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,890
So remember, if you remember from last
week, that the black group and

127
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,600
the red group both were a little bit
higher in bone density at

128
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,590
baseline than the blue group.

129
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,490
And there were both around 0.03, 0.04 more
than the blue group.

130
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,150
So, if we add together the intercept and
the main effect for the black group,

131
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,840
that would give you the average bone
density for the black group at base line.

132
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,300
Notice that the P values are totally non
significant, saying that there is,

133
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,530
that at baseline, there was some slight
differences between the groups in

134
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,650
bone density, but it was not a significant
difference.

135
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,920
The blue group again is the reference
group, so that's just set, fixed at zero.

136
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,290
Then we get the time by group interaction.

137
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,240
And what the time by group interaction
represents is the rate of change,

138
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,970
the difference in the rate of change in
bone density over time for

139
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,500
the black group versus the blue group.

140
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,670
And the time by red group interaction
would represent the difference in the rate

141
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,260
of change over time in spine bone density
for the red group versus the blue group.

142
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,320
So the rate of change for the blue group
was right around zero.

143
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,240
For the black group it's going to be this
0.0108 plus the negative 0.0007.

144
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,950
So you would add the time effect plus the
time by

145
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,710
black effect to get the rate of change for
the black group.

146
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,920
Because this coefficient represents the
difference in rate of

147
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,780
changes between the black and the, the
reference group.

148
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,840
So.

149
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,220
You know, the black group was going up
about one

150
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,960
percent more over time per year than the
blue group.

151
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,250
The time, we set the time to be years so
that this is a rate of change per year.

152
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,940
The red group was also very similar,

153
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,628
was going up just slightly more than the
black group.

154
00:08:19,628 --> 00:08:21,640
0.014.

155
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,180
And notice that both of these are
statistically significant.

156
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,640
That's telling you that the rate of change
in bone density is higher in

157
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,320
those two groups compared with the
reference group.

158
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,010
All of that is very similar to what we saw
in the picture.

159
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,370
But now we have P values and effect sizes
to go with them.

160
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,010
We are assuming here, so go back to the
picture here,

161
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,638
we are assuming what we have done
essentially here is to fit straight lines.

162
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:47,070
We have assumed that there is a linear
rate of change over time for

163
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,990
all of these three groups, so we fit
straight lines to them.

164
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,140
So just keep in mind that if the changes
over time were not linear.

165
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,130
If they were quadratic or something, we
would have to take that into account.

166
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,310
But linear seems like a good choice here,
they, they look pretty close to lines.

167
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:06,350
So that was with if I used the
exchangeable correlation matrix.

168
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,110
I'm just going to show you

169
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,370
what the exchangeable correlation ends up
being here.

170
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:14,150
It estimates the same correlation of about
0.976 5 at all the time periods.

171
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,320
The QIC for this model comes out to be
133.4.

172
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,280
I then just for fun also used

173
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,350
an auto-regressive correlation matrix just
to see if it made any difference.

174
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,990
So here's the results from the
auto-regressive correlation matrix.

175
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,840
You can see we get the basically the same
results.

176
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,800
The changes over time in the blue, black
group and

177
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,240
the red group are significantly different
from the blue group.

178
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,990
Pretty much all of the same answers,
slightly, slightly different estimate.

179
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,460
But basically the same answer.

180
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,450
and, if you go and look at the working
correlation matrix, so

181
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,570
what you'll see is you get two correlation
coefficients.

182
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,475
This one and then you square 0.9999 you
get 0.9998 so

183
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:57,240
we only, cost us only one degree of
freedom.

184
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,780
The QIC is just slightly smaller than what
we saw with the exchangeable, but

185
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,130
I would say either one of those would be a
good fit.

186
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,890
And going to give very comparable answers.

187
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,570
I also just wanted to show you so

188
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,160
I've now shown you a time independent
predictor that's a categorical predictor.

189
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,030
I wanted to also show you a continuous
time independent predictor so

190
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,130
you have that example as well.

191
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,950
So, I used an example here that comes from
another, version of my runners data set,

192
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,984
but this is from a larger sample from that
runners data set.

193
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:28,640
A sample of a 125 women.

194
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,320
And I want to look whether or not a
woman's base line calcium intake

195
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,440
was related to her subsequent changes in
spine bone density over time.

196
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,670
And, so notice that calcium is something
that could be a time changing predictor.

197
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,070
I could have measured it and in fact did
measure it at multiple time points.

198
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,740
But for the purposes of this model, I'm
only using the baseline calcium intake,

199
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,720
sort of their first measure of how much
calcium they eat.

200
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,140
And so this is actually I'm making this
into a time independent predictor.

201
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,170
You'll see why there's maybe some
advantages to that when we get to

202
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,704
a later module.

203
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:08,580
I used here, not the absolute calcium
intake but I use the calcium residuals.

204
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,170
So I did a regression where calcium was
the outcome,

205
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,000
calories was the predictor, and so I get
the residuals from that regression.

206
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,670
Those residuals represent whether or not a
women has a high or

207
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,260
low calcium diet for her caloric intake.

208
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,370
And I put those in standard deviation
units.

209
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,990
So everything here is in standard
deviation units.

210
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,920
So the model that I fit, the outcome is
bone density again.

211
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,140
I have an intercept in the model, I have a
beta for time.

212
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,820
And then I have a beta for your baseline
calcium, that's the main effect for

213
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,970
the time independent predictor of calcium.

214
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,280
And then I've got that interaction with
timing again.

215
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,850
You have to put that interaction with time
in to see what,

216
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,860
what is the effect of calcium on the
changes over time.

217
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,430
So I've got a baseline calcium value
interacting with time.

218
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,080
I went ahead and fit that to these 125
women, fit that model.

219
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,870
And here's the results.

220
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,900
So let me just walk you through what all
these results mean.

221
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,940
So, first of all the intercept, what does
the intercept actually represent here?

222
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,200
So again the intercept is the value when
everything else in

223
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,910
the model is set to zero.

224
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,370
So this would be so time would be set to
zero.

225
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,480
So this would represent baseline.

226
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,630
And remember that calcium is in standard
deviation units.

227
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,070
So a value of zero here represents that
you have the average calcium intake for

228
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,060
the sample.

229
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,250
So a woman with the average calcium
intake.

230
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,020
For this sample at baseline had a spine
bone density on average of about 0.9888.

231
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,480
The value for

232
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,560
time, which is again is in years here,
that does come out to be significant.

233
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,262
it comes out to be about 0.0035.

234
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:44,460
This would represent the rate of change in
spine bone density.

235
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,850
For a woman whose calcium intake is
average,

236
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,870
who has a standard deviation of calcium
intake of zero.

237
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,620
So if you're kind of average calcium
intake,

238
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,950
you're going up about 0.0035 units of
spine bone density per year,

239
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,770
and that is highly significant, so that is
a significant increase over time.

240
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,760
If you're at the average calcium intake
for the sample.

241
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,910
The main effect for calcium.

242
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,550
You can see is very close to zero, is not
statistically significant.

243
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,970
What that is telling you is that if you
had a higher calcium intake and

244
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,680
base line that was uncorrelated to your
baseline bone density.

245
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,210
However, if you had a high calcium intake
at baseline that predicted that

246
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,830
your changes in spine bone density over
time in the rest of

247
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,800
the study would be significantly positive.

248
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,710
So if you were one standard deviation
above average in

249
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,990
calcium intake that predicts that your
rate of change in spine bone density would

250
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:43,050
be about 0.0018 higher than somebody who
had just the average rate of change.

251
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,280
So someone with the average calcium
intake,

252
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,380
their rate of change is going to be 0.0035
per year.

253
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,916
Somebody who has, is one standard
deviation above average in

254
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:58,472
Calcium intake at baseline, meaning that
they kind of have a high calcium diet,

255
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:02,747
their rate of change is predicted to be
0.0035 plus 0.0018.

256
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:05,760
So, that comes out to be about .0053 per
year.

257
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,280
And the difference between the average
intake and

258
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,170
one standard deviation above is indeed
statistically significant.

259
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,340
So your having a high calcium intake
predicts a higher change in

260
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,870
bone density over time.
