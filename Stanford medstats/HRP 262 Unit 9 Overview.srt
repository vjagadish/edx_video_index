2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,650
Welcome to Unit 9.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,960
This is the final unit of the course, so

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,727
after this all you have left is the final
exam.

5
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:14,960
This week I'm going to introduce you to
the use of mixed models for

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,920
analyzing repeated measures data.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,680
Last week we talked about the use of
generalized estimating equations for

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,030
analyzing repeated measures data.

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,860
This week, I'm going to take those same
data, and show you

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,160
how analyze them using a different
technique, called the mixed model.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,766
The good news is that whether or

12
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:38,853
not you choose to analyze your data with a
generalized estimating equation, or

13
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:43,090
a mixed model, for most cases, you're
going to get fairly similar results.

14
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,810
The answer ought to be the same, even if
there are slight differences in,

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,160
say, the point apex, and the P values.

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,960
I tend to, if I've got a continuous
outcome, I tend to prefer the mixed model.

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,360
If I've got a discreet outcome,

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,660
I tend to prefer the generalized
estimating equations.

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,856
There are slight advantages to each of
those, for each of those cases.

20
00:01:00,856 --> 00:01:03,325
[BLANK_AUDIO].

21
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:05,437
Before we jump into the discussion of
mixed models,

22
00:01:05,437 --> 00:01:07,550
I just wanted to point one thing out.

23
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,566
We have been mostly focusing on,

24
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:13,760
all of our examples have centered on
repeated-measures over time.

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,110
So, longitudinal data.

26
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,520
That's the focus of this course.

27
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,570
I wanted to point out,

28
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,540
however, that if you had a different kind
of repeated measure.

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,870
Where you had repeated measures over
conditions, rather than time,

30
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:30,070
that the general approaches to analyzing
the data would be the same.

31
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,977
So again, we've been focusing on you've
got the same subject

32
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:36,600
measurement measured at different time
points, like in a cohort study.

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,490
But what if you had a situation where you
had the same subject measured not over

34
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,880
time, but in different, say, experimental
conditions.

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,050
So imagine you did a study where you were
measuring people's brain activity in

36
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,190
the laboratory.

37
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,635
When you have them exercise, and maybe
when you have them drink alcohol, and

38
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:54,180
when you have them listen to music.

39
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,410
There is no time element there, but it's
the same person at different,

40
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,490
under different conditions rather than at
different times.

41
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,090
All the things we have talked about, where
we were talking about time,

42
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,090
can be easily adapted to the case where we
have different conditions.

43
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,220
And so what, how you would do that is that
rather than having a mean effect for

44
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,920
timing the model,

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,350
wherever we've been seeing time in our
models you replace that with a condition.

46
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,110
The condition will act sort of like the
time effect.

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,661
If you have different groups you'd have a
group effect, and you would also have

48
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:28,490
a group by condition interaction rather
than a group by time interaction.

49
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,250
So, you can just kind of go through the
code, and

50
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,480
replace wherever you see time, replace
with condition.

51
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,540
The only slight difference that your
going to have is that the correlation

52
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,890
structures may be different.

53
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,607
So when you have correlations over time,
it tends to be that the further and

54
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:46,750
further apart you get in time, the less
and less correlated observations are.

55
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,614
With conditions, there usually isn't some
odd priority structure that you'd expect,

56
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:55,500
some operating pattern that you'd expect
for the correlations.

57
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,750
So for that reason you're probably
going to end up choosing something like

58
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,150
an exchangeable, or an unstructured
correlation matrix rather than something

59
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,550
that you might choose when you were doing
time, like an auto-regressive one.

60
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,170
All right, now let me just give you a very
brief introduction to mixed models just to

61
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,329
set up the picture for you.

62
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,380
So recall that a couple of weeks ago we
talked about something called

63
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,910
a slope analysis.

64
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,560
So this is where we fit separate linear
regression lines for

65
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,520
each person based on their repeated
measurements.

66
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,040
And it was a two step process, so

67
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,750
we took each person's individual slope
from those individual linear regressions.

68
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,849
We stored those slopes, and then we used
those slopes for further analyses.

69
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,870
Well, in a way, the slope analysis is kind
of a poor man's mixed model.

70
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,630
So if you understood the slope analysis,

71
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,780
you're going to understand, the mixed
models.

72
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,110
the, drawback of the slope analysis is
that we

73
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,850
had to do it as a two step process.

74
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,050
But what if you could actually, in one
single linear regression model,

75
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,210
fit a separate linear regression line for
each subject?

76
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,142
That's essentially what a mixed model
does, and

77
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,550
I'm showing you the picture of that here.

78
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,150
So we had some data last week where I had
just six subjects, and

79
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,000
they had depression scores measured over
time.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,010
I am showing you here the predictive
values from the mixed model for

81
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,870
those subjects.

82
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,447
And what you'll see, is that each subject
has their own,

83
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:22,608
linear regression lines, so there's a
predicted intercept, and

84
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:26,115
a predicted slope that's different for
each subject.

85
00:04:26,115 --> 00:04:29,642
So we're getting subject specific linear
regression line.

86
00:04:29,642 --> 00:04:33,890
Which is great, because this controls for
the, within subject correlation.

87
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,434
Now, if I were actually to ask you to go
out, and, accomplish this,

88
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:43,340
to fit subject specific linear regression
lines, your first instinct,

89
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,120
might be to say, okay, well, I guess I
could run a linear regression,

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,703
with my continuous outcome at my
intercept, and

91
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:54,390
then I could actually fit separate
coefficients for each subject, right?

92
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,886
If I want a subject specific intercept for

93
00:04:56,886 --> 00:04:59,950
subject one, I would have to fit a beta
for subject one.

94
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,130
And then if I wanted a, a slope for

95
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,880
subject one, I could fit a subject one
times time interaction.

96
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,840
And then same thing if I wanted to fit one
for subject two.

97
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,461
And the slope for subject two, and I would
literally have to do this in the model for

98
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:17,120
every person in my data set.

99
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, that would control for subject, and
give me subject specific effects.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,700
However, of course there's an obvious
problem with this,

101
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,960
which is that you can see clearly that we
don't have enough degrees of freedom.

102
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,736
This model's just going to blow up,
because there's no way we can fit so

103
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:31,795
many parameters.

104
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:35,920
However, a mixed model kind of
accomplishes this in a clever way.

105
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,230
So rather than fitting a specific
parameter for each subject, or

106
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:39,920
two parameters for

107
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,780
each subject, which is clearly, we don't
have enough degrees of freedom for.

108
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,330
What our next model does instead is very
clever.

109
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,411
It says well, we can fit subject specific
intercepts simply by

110
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:54,940
assuming that those intercepts follow a
particular distribution.

111
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,636
We are going to assume that they follow a
normal distribution, and

112
00:05:58,636 --> 00:06:02,926
normal distributions have only two
parameters, a mean, and a variance, so

113
00:06:02,926 --> 00:06:06,820
we can estimate a whole set of
subject-specific intercepts simply by

114
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,830
estimating just the two parameters of that
normal distribution.

115
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,639
There'll be a mean intercept, which in
this case is going to fall

116
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,342
somewhere around here, and then there'll
be a variance for

117
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:21,200
the intercept, which will help us to
define, the subject's specific intercepts.

118
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,960
That's if the variance is represented by
the, different values at baseline here.

119
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,770
And we can do the same things for the
slopes.

120
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,400
We can define a distribution of slopes,
that again depends on only two parameters,

121
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,780
a mean and a variance.

122
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,430
If we fit that mean in the variance,

123
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,050
then we've got a whole set of subject
specific slopes.

124
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,210
And in this way, with very few degrees of
freedom is used,

125
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,170
we are able to fit subject specific
regression lines.

126
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,408
And therefore, account for the within
subject variability.

127
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,430
That's the general idea of mixed models.
