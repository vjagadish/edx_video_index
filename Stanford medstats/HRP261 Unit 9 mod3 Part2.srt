1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,020
Now I'm going to return to my two
hypothetical eye trial examples.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,890
These are nice, some nice,

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,720
simple data that I can use to illustrate
how GE modeling works.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,070
So remember, the first trial, every
patient,

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,110
there were 50 patients with bilateral eye
disease.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,180
Every patient received both the drug in
one eye and the placebo in the other eye.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,010
The outcome was a binary outcome of
improvement, yes or no.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,320
In the second hypothetical trial, it was
basically the same except,

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,260
every person got the drug in both eyes, or
the placebo in both eyes.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,570
So they only got one or the other.

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,130
Now, if we're talking about the first
example, the within person example where

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,690
we're having different things happening
within a person.

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,960
I can, we first need to look at what is
the correlation between you know,

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,330
within eyes in a person.

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,300
So, what is the left and right eye in a
person are they correlated?

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,940
And in fact, in these made up data.

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,800
Of course, they're made up, so I made sure
they were.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,120
They were in fact correlated.

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,430
So there was a correlation of about 0.36
for within eye, you know, within a person.

20
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,480
A person who improves in one eye is more
likely to improve in the other eye.

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,090
That's what that means.

22
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,725
Now the as I said, for

23
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:10,530
GEE models, you have to start by choosing
a correlation structure.

24
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,552
So it's really easy here because the
correlation matrix there's only one

25
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:15,410
correlation coefficient.

26
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,780
I made a really simple example right.

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,470
So there's only one correlation
coefficient.

28
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:23,710
So we can just choose the exchangeable
correlation which is actually going to

29
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,590
be the same as the unstructured here
because there's only a single correlation.

30
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,110
There's only one choice here, which is
exchangeable and

31
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,526
that's the same as structured.

32
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:36,340
So I, I'll get, for a lot of cases, we're
just talking about cluster data.

33
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,820
Even if there is more than one correlation
coefficient,

34
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,150
oftentimes we're still just picking the
exchangeable.

35
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,810
That is sort of the most commonly used.

36
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,730
You might choose unstructured if you, you
know,

37
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,620
if there aren't too many correlation
coefficients to estimate.

38
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,040
Now interestingly, it turns out that in
this example, we could also,

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,550
I'm going to show you, we could also
choose the independent structure.

40
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,120
That way, as you know, we could pretend we
had that the correlation between the eyes

41
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,170
was actually zero.

42
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,160
And you might say, well how, how can that
be.

43
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,180
Because we, the whole point of GEE is to
correct for non-independence.

44
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,320
But it turns out that GEE modeling relies
on something called,

45
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,240
you can calculate something called robust
standard errors.

46
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,630
And those standard errors, when you
calculate those they're fairly.

47
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,240
Robust against the misspecification of
correlation.

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,570
In fact, if you put independents in here
but choose the robust standard errors,

49
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,570
you're still going to get clues to the
right answer.

50
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,950
So of course, you, in this case, want to
choose the exchangeable.

51
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,860
But if you got it wrong and choose the
independence, which is really wrong,

52
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,120
you still do well as long as you report
the robust standard error.

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,570
I'll, I'll talk more about that in a bit.

54
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,410
So first of all, I just applied regular,

55
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,340
all this logistic regression to these
data, ignoring the correlation.

56
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,360
This is the incorrect analysis.

57
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,660
So when I do that, what you'll notice is
that I get a P-value of 0.07 that's

58
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,248
too high, because the correct analysis
here is, is comparing within subjects.

59
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:58,880
And so ignoring the correlation makes are
P value too high.

60
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,900
Our odds ratio is about two.

61
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,690
We have an intercept because this is
ordinary logistic regression.

62
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,090
Recall that then also fit these data with
conditional logistic regression which is

63
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,750
a perfectly valid to set these data if you
just want to do with or

64
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,060
within person to person comparison.

65
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,450
The odds ratio is a little higher here.

66
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,640
But the P value went down because we, when
we analyze these data,

67
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,050
correctly accounting for correlation, the
P value becomes smaller.

68
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,170
Conditional Logistic Regression is a
possible choice here.

69
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,940
For this situation, I probably prefer to
use

70
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,980
the GEE model rather than Conditional
Logistic regression, but

71
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,399
you'll see that we get very similar
answers.

72
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,480
Again the correlation structure here is
just exchangeable because there's only one

73
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,180
correlation to estimate.

74
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,010
So I asked the computer to do a GEE model,
I specified

75
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,310
an exchangeable correlation matrix, and
here is the results that I get.

76
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,290
Now when we do the GEE model we are back
to getting the intercepts.

77
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,410
So we now do get in a unlikely with a
conditional logistic regression Where we

78
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,940
didn't get an intercept, with a GEE model
we will get an intercept.

79
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,330
We're not doing any kind of conditioned
likihood where things are cancelling.

80
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,960
The P value here comes out to be 0.0248.

81
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,617
I'll just remind you that when we analyze
the same data with McNamera's test the P

82
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:08,770
value was 0.029.

83
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,990
So, this is very close.

84
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,180
Its a little bit closer to the McNamera's
test than the conditional logistic

85
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,770
regression is.

86
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,920
Notice that the odds ratio here the 2.078
output in Sass, for

87
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,340
the odds ratio is a little funny, because
you have to ask specifically for this, but

88
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,770
this is just the odds ratio.

89
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,628
Notice that the odd, the odds ratio 2.078
and beta coefficient 0.7357.

90
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:34,310
If you go back to the incorrect analysis,
with regular logistic regression,

91
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,700
the beta, and of course the odds ration
then are identical.

92
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,650
So you're getting the exact same magnitude
of the effect is

93
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,880
only the standard errors that really gets
effected by doing GEE modeling.

94
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,970
So the point estimates don't change it's
just the standard errors.

95
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,270
So that's it, that's our GEE model.

96
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,360
Again, got the same beta coefficient as
with the ordinary logistic regression, so

97
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
if I didn't care about P-values and
standard errors.

98
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,000
I, you know, that would have been fine.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,875
But usually I care about reporting
confidence intervals and

100
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,770
P-values, so I need to do the correct GEE
model.

101
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,000
I then ask the computer here to give me
the working correlation matrix.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,770
So you can actually ask a computer to just
say,

103
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,050
well what did you come up with for that
correlation matrix at the end of the day?

104
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,230
So remember that when we look at the
actual correlations in this simple case.

105
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,418
The correlation within I's was something
like 0.3, it was close to 0.36,

106
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:22,530
it was 0.35 something.

107
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,645
Let me go back here and get that actual
number.

108
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:29,070
0.358 essentially.

109
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,380
So, that's what we actually, that's the
actual correlation.

110
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,040
Of course, we're doing some kind of
quasi-likelihood method here, and

111
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,350
it's estimating things, and it's coming
out to be pretty close.

112
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,120
It's right around where we'd expect, about
0.36.

113
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,190
So that's the working correlation matrix
we came up with.

114
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,160
It corrected our standard, and

115
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,290
therefore our P-values by the fact that we
have correlation here.

116
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,330
These standard errors that I reported back
here are what we call

117
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,570
robust standard errors in SASS.

118
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,510
This is the default.

119
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,270
You get out what are called the robust
errors.

120
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,830
They're also called the empirical standard
errors.

121
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,530
So that's the same thing as robust
standard errors,

122
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,880
I've been talking about robust standard
errors.

123
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,200
But you'll see it also as empirical
standard errors.

124
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,450
Those are the defaults, those are the ones
that you generally want to report.

125
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,380
Now, I want to just show you that there's
another type of standard error that you

126
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,930
can ask for.

127
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,970
That you have to actually ask for in SASS,
specifically, but

128
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,810
it's something called the model-based
standard error.

129
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,140
And I'll just show you that as long as we
specify,

130
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,510
I've specified an exchangeable correlation
matrix here, as long as we specify

131
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,220
the correlation structure correctly we get
about the same P value, but still 0.02.

132
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,910
So the model-based standard errors will be
fine if you

133
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,740
get the correlation structure right.

134
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,040
Notice beta doesn't not effected again
only the P value is.

135
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,860
So, I'll talk a little bit more about the
difference between these two

136
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,450
standard errors and

137
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,300
when you might want to use the model based
errors and just in just a minute here.

138
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,000
But I just want to point out that as long
as you're

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,840
getting the correlation structure right
they actually come out pretty,

140
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,220
fairly similar but I just want to show
you.

141
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,370
I then ran the GEE model but I specified I
wanted independent correlation structure.

142
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,340
Okay, that's the totally wrong correlation
structure.

143
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,370
Because clearly the eyes are correlated
within a person here.

144
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,640
But I got the robust standard errors
again, that's the default in SASS,

145
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,030
so here is when I ask for the independent
correlation structure.

146
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:13,540
I get basically the same P-value as when I
asked for the exchangeable.

147
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,720
As long as I'm using the empirical or
robust standard error, so nothing changes.

148
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,030
However, if I specify independent
correlation structure, but ask for

149
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,450
the model-based standard errors,

150
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,560
I'm basically going back to a regular old
logistical regression.

151
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,820
This is the same P-value I got out of an
ordinary logistic regression.

152
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,324
So, if I get the correlation structure
wrong and ask for

153
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:34,010
the model-bases standard errors, I could
be very off.

154
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,940
I'm essentially gone back to not
correcting for the correlation here.

155
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,170
but, the robust standard errors do well
even if I get the correlation structure

156
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,190
totally off.

157
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,009
So, ju, that's just something to keep in
mind.

158
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,920
again, there's two types of standard
errors, what we call robust or

159
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,790
empirical and model-based.

160
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,070
And in general, you're going to report the
robust standard errors.

161
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,750
That's generally what you report.

162
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,790
It's the default in SASS.

163
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,330
You have to specifically ask for the other
type, type of standard error.

164
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,750
The robust errors are great because they
are robust against the incorrect choice of

165
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,068
correlation structure, as we've seen.

166
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:06,890
Whereas the model-based standard errors
are very sensitive to that.

167
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,370
There are a few cases, however, where the
model-based standard errors are preferred.

168
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,250
So I'll just point those out.

169
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,190
If you have a situation where you have a
low number of clusters.

170
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,790
So you know,

171
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,350
this could be, like, a randomized cluster
trial where you have, you know,

172
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,560
you randomized five schools to one thing
and five schools to another thing.

173
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,300
So you'll only have ten total clusters.

174
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,268
There's situations where you might have a,
kind of a low number of clusters.

175
00:08:28,268 --> 00:08:31,250
Then the model-based standard errors are
actually preferred.

176
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,830
Of course you're going to try to get the
right correlation structure, so

177
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,340
that in a way it doesn't matter.

178
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,110
So this latter situation with low number
of clusters,

179
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,670
you wouldn't find that usually for
something like repeated measures where

180
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,050
you're measuring a whole bunch of people
over time.

181
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,560
Usually with repeated-measures, you have
kind of a large number of subjects and

182
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,050
a few number of time points so they're
not, you know,

183
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,190
you don't have a low number of clusters.

184
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,390
But sometimes, we had you know,

185
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,390
again, something like a randomized cluster
trial, this situation could come up.

186
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,380
So that I'll just point out that those
model-based standard errors are there for

187
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,640
that kind of situation.

188
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,040
Now let's move to this hypothetical eye
trial two.

189
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,170
This is a situation where the patients
were

190
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,820
treated in both eyes with the same
treatment, either the drug or the placebo.

191
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,050
When I look at the correlation between
eyes in the same person from this

192
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,030
trial it's much higher.

193
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,690
And the reason being is that you got the
same treatment in both eyes.

194
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,630
So when you don't get the same treatment
in both eyes,

195
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,240
of course, if the treatment does anything
the correlation is going to be lower.

196
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,540
When we treat both eyes with the same
treatment, we're getting somewhat more

197
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,580
similar outcomes and so we get a little
bit of a higher correlations.

198
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,530
The correlation here is 0.6, which is just
quite a bit high.

199
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,600
Of course, these are made up data so

200
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,790
I just made the correlations come out high
like this.

201
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,980
So, that's the correlation matrix, the
observed correlation matrix for

202
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,950
the hypothetical trial two.

203
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,710
I then took those,

204
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,700
those data, ran them in the incorrect
ordinary logistic regression.

205
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,640
Remember, here we're doing between cluster
comparisons, right,

206
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,290
because we're comparing a person who got
treatments in both eyes, or, or

207
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,580
the, the eyes from the same person.

208
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,620
To and an, another person's eyes; who
didn't get treatment.

209
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,260
So we're comparing across people.

210
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,010
And so when we do the incorrect analysis,
we fail to account for

211
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,500
correlations, our P values are too small.

212
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,260
As we've already seen with this example,

213
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,360
our P value here comes out to be
significantly lower,

214
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,234
essentially over counting eyes The beta is
0.8, and the odds ratio is about 2.28.

215
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:24,720
So that's the incorrect analysis.

216
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,450
When I then run the GEE model, I'm
specifying I

217
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,620
want an exchangeable correlation matrix,
and I run my GEE model on the same data.

218
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,120
Notice I get the same data coefficient,
same odds ratio, so

219
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,670
that doesn't change, but my P-value goes
up.

220
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,180
This is no longer statistically
significant anymore.

221
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,250
Because now we've we've corrected for
that.

222
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,980
We've gotten rid of that double counting
of eyes, essentially.

223
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,920
So here's the, the correct P value.

224
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,150
I asked the computer to give me the
working correlation matrix.

225
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,007
Remember that the observed correlation was
about 0.66.

226
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,940
When it goes through this whole estimation
method,

227
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,500
it estimates the correlation matrix and

228
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,240
gets correlations of about .59 so that's
very close.

229
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,630
It's, it's doing you know, what we'd
expect here.

230
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,840
Now I also asked to get the model based
standard error just to show you,

231
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,370
If I correctly specify exchangeable
correlation matrix.

232
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,850
Which is the right structure here, you
know,

233
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,676
I get the same beta, I get about the same
P-value with this

234
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:21,800
model-based standard error as I get with
the robust standard errors.

235
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,210
However, when I incorrectly specify the
correlation structure,

236
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,890
I say it's independent when clearly these
are not independent.

237
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,220
The robust standard errors still do
perfectly.

238
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,040
So notice that the P-value's still 0.11.

239
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,860
That, that's the correct P value here.

240
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,450
So the robust standard errors are
empirical standard errors.

241
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,510
I get the right answer even if I specify
the totally wrong correlation structure.

242
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,750
However, the model based standard errors
take me back to just

243
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,210
a regular logistic regression now, and so
I get the wrong P value.

244
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,810
So again, there's only certain situations
where you might want to

245
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,880
think about the model based errors, but in
general you're going to chose the robust.

246
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,190
And I just want to add one last example
here just to show you again the,

247
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,700
the effect, the impact that this can have
upon standard errors and P values.

248
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,670
So hypothetical eye trial three, is the
same as hypothetical eye trial two.

249
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,440
But I rejiggered the data to make it so

250
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,550
that there's perfect correlation between
eyes.

251
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,250
So in a, in a single person who got
treatment Both eyes improve or

252
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,190
both eyes don't improve.

253
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,340
And the same with the person who got
placebo.

254
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,770
So I made it you know, a mock dataset
where the correlation is perfect.

255
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,790
So here's the observed correlation matrix.

256
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,810
There's perfect correlation between the
eyes.

257
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,100
I just want to show you that the bigger
the correlation the more impact it's going

258
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,000
to have if you fail to account for it.

259
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,740
So, when I did ordinary logistic
regression,

260
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,380
I'm still getting this overly optimistic P
value of about 0.04.

261
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,680
When I then run the correct GEE model now,
when I have this much correlation.

262
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,340
Same outcomes, same number of eyes
improved, in each group.

263
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,876
But more correlation between eyes than the
P-value,

264
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:55,210
the correct P-value was even smaller.

265
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,490
Because I'm totally double counting,
right.

266
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,560
If everybody always improves, both of
their eyes always improve, or

267
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,930
both of their eyes always don't improve,

268
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,410
then I'm completely double counting when I
count two eyes from the same person.

269
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,750
There's no longer any additional
information from the second eye.

270
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,230
So there's even more of an impact on my
p-values from over counting here.

271
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,070
The true P-value is even, is even worse
here.

272
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:20,420
So just to kind of bring home the idea
that it's very important to

273
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,220
account for correlation.

274
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,800
The bigger the correlations, of course,

275
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,560
the more impact they're going to have on
your standard errors and your P-values.

276
