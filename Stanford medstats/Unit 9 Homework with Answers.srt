1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,540
What's the reference group here?

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,450
Well we can see that from the table so
you'll notice that the category of greater

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,930
than or equal to four months, they all
have odds ratios here of 1.0, so

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,990
you, you know that that was set as the
reference group.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,820
So the correct answer here is b.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,550
Predominant breastfeeding of at least four
months.

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,940
So how do we interpret this adjusted odds
ratio of 1.24 42 for

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,580
the women, for the men who were breast fed
less than one month.

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:36,320
This is the, increase in odds in those
breastfed less than one month.

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,340
Compared with those breastfed at least
four months.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,680
That's our reference group.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,050
And it, the confidence interval crosses
one.

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,330
So the effect is not statistically
significant.

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,270
So we have a 43% increase in the odds of

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,750
being obese at 18 years but it is not a
statistically significant.

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,840
The you might have got confused here
because there's a significant p value for

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,830
linear trend over here.

18
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,620
That only tells us that the decrease in
the prevalence of

19
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,470
obesity across different breast feeding
categories is statistically significant.

20
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,320
That's not the same as saying that this
particular comparison between the less

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,240
than one month group.

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,610
And the the reference group is
statistically significant, so that's

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:23,040
a little tricky there but this confidence
interval you can see does cross one.

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,280
You can see that across this table, the
difference between the crude ratio and

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,370
the adjusted odds ratio was not very large
really anywhere.

26
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,970
That tells you that this, the correct
answer here, is false.

27
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,100
The crude and adjusted odds ratios are
extremely similar.

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,940
It looks like there's very little
confounding going on.

29
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,880
There's very, it's unlikely that there are
any strong confounders here.

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,130
If we had strong con founders,

31
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,900
it would greatly change the magnitudes of
these odds ratios.

32
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,058
So the data coefficient for a cardiac
surgery is negative.

33
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:57,280
This means that A is correct.

34
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,100
The patients who had cardiac surgery were
less likely to

35
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,270
die after discharge than patients with
other conditions.

36
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,910
If you have a negative data,

37
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,170
remember we're exponentiating here to get
the hazard ratio.

38
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,820
That would give us a hazard ratio below
one which would say that the rate of

39
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,750
death for these patients was lower than
the other groups.

40
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,250
To translate the beta coefficient of
0.2501 into an odds ratio we're

41
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,616
just going to exponentiate here.

42
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:26,950
If you exponentiate 0.2501 you get an odds
ratio of 1.28, so

43
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,820
that's the correct answer there.

44
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,810
So this question is asking about the
length of ICU stay as a predictor.

45
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,290
If you look at the data coefficient here,
and if you exponentiate that,

46
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,350
you see that you get an odds ratio of
1.046.

47
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,400
That seems like a really small odds ratio,
right, it's very close to, to one.

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,540
You look at the P value, however, and it's
statistically significant.

49
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,180
Well, what's going on here is that b is
correct.

50
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,720
The odds ratio here is giving the change
in odds for every one day

51
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,610
increase in ICU stay, so the units here
for ICU stay are in only one day units.

52
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,349
That's a small unit, cause somebody can
stay in the ICU for

53
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:06,677
many, many days, even weeks.

54
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:10,330
So because we'er only talking about the
odds ratio associated with

55
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,705
a one unit increase, it looks pretty
small.

56
00:03:12,705 --> 00:03:16,280
Obivously if we were talking about staying
a whole week,

57
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,850
this odds ratio would be much bigger.

58
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,340
So it depends on the units.

59
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,710
The odds ratio depends on the units, when
you have continuous variables.

60
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,305
So, b would be correct here.

61
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:28,950
So age is a continuous variable here.

62
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,470
This is given in units of one year
increases in age.

63
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,085
Our beta is given in one year increments.

64
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:36,160
In, increases in age.

65
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,530
If you wanted to say, what's the odds
ratio for a ten year increase in age,

66
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,960
you'd have to take that beta coefficient
and multiply it by 10.

67
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,260
You would see that that gives you a value
of 0.532, and

68
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,585
then you exponentiate that value.

69
00:03:50,585 --> 00:03:53,910
0.532 to get the corresponding odds ratio.

70
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,280
So the odds ratio here would be 1.70.

71
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,500
The goal of this model, this was a
predictive model so

72
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,960
the goal here was to find the combination
of variables that

73
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,780
identifies the patients most likely to die
after discharge.

74
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,540
So the correct answer is a.

75
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,360
They really weren't after a particular
hypothesis here, so

76
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,930
they're not try to adjust for con founders
or test for interactions here.

77
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,998
They're really trying to do prediction
here, so a is the correct answer.

78
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:24,474
So this next one you literally just have
to crank through,

79
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:26,450
plug into the model here.

80
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,800
So we get our intercept is negative 4.58.

81
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,640
This person had a ICU stay of 10, so I'm
multiplying that by the beta for ICU stay.

82
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:42,720
Their age here was 50, so we multiply
0.0532 times 50.

83
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,840
They have one on both the chronic health
points and the acute physiology points, so

84
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,910
each of those gets a one.

85
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,050
When you do this all out, you get that the
predicted logit is 1.182 ,

86
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,330
and then if we want to get from there the
predicted probability.

87
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,630
We have to do this little trick of raising
e to the predicted logit, and

88
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,310
then dividing by 1 plus e raised to the
predicted logit.

89
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,650
If you calculate that all that out, you
get a a percentage,

90
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,244
a predicted probability of 54% so the
correct answer here is e.

91
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,530
In including continuous predictors in the
model, the authors are assuming that these

92
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,120
predictors have a linear relationship with
our outcome here,

93
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,220
which is the logit of death.

94
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,230
So the correct answer here is b.

95
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,666
The correct answer here is a.

96
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:32,874
Our hazard ratio is 1.35 so that indicates
a 35%

97
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:39,230
increase in the rate of dementia after
accounting for confounders.

98
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:44,110
And it is statistically significant,
because that confidence interval does not

99
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,095
cross one, it goes from 1.14 to 1.60, so
that is statistically significant.

100
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:55,195
So, how do we interpret these hazard
ratios for the underweight for women?

101
00:05:55,195 --> 00:06:00,280
So, what you'll notice is that they are
all elevated by similar amounts as

102
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,365
the overweight and the obese, compared
with normal weight.

103
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:05,400
However all of the confidence intervals
cross one.

104
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,910
Well how do we interpret this?

105
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,529
Well, what's probably going on here is
that, that under weight category is small,

106
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:13,130
there aren't that many people running
around who are under weight.

107
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,265
So it does look like there's some
elevation in the risk of dementia here,

108
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:20,000
but perhaps because of the small sample
size we have low statistical power.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,310
And that's why the findings don't reach a
statistical significance.

110
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,875
So the best choice here would be a.

111
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,360
Being underweight may increase the risk of
dementia, but the findings are not

112
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,668
statistically significant, likely due to
small sample size.

113
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:41,730
For this question you have to be careful
about how you determine interaction.

114
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,120
In fact, the correct answer here is c, we
don't have enough information in

115
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,770
this table alone to tell whether or not we
have a significant act.

116
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:54,130
Interaction between gender with the weight
category and

117
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,785
our outcome here, dementia in midlife.

118
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:58,690
It does look like there's less of a
relationship, right?

119
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,980
For men, it doesn't look like there's a
It's a huge relationship between

120
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,820
the weight and the outcome.

121
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,880
And for women it does look like there's a
significant relationship.

122
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,990
But remember, that's not proof of
interaction.

123
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,300
Just because it's, the relationship is
significant in one group but

124
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,340
not significant in the other group, that
does not constitute proof of interaction.

125
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,900
We'd actually have to do a formal
statistical test, in which we compared

126
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,300
these particular relationships to say
whether or not, say for

127
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,920
example, this 2.07 is significantly higher
than this 1.3 for men.

128
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,250
So that's a little bit of a trick, a
tricky question there,

129
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,400
but you have to do a formal test of
interaction to know if these were

130
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,150
actually statistically different from one
another.

131
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,014
The, the relationship in men versus the
relationship in women.

132
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:47,210
The correct answer here is actually false.

133
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,920
You'll notice that as we adjust for
confounders here,

134
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,980
what's happening is that the hazard ratios
are actually going up, so, for

135
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,010
example, for the obese, it goes from 1.59
to 1.8 to 2.07.

136
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,060
So, we've seen some examples in the
modules where you, when you adjust for

137
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,960
things, the relationship attenuates, but
it can go the other direction.

138
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,330
Sometimes, adjusting for things will
actually increase the relationship, so

139
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,660
the adjusting is kind of going the other
direction.

140
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:17,040
So this, therefore, this is not likely to
be due to residual confounding,

141
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,540
because, if anything failing to adjust for

142
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,350
confounding here seems to be
underestimating our effects.

143
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:29,510
Also, a value of 2.07 is beyond the range
that we would normally consider for

144
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,780
residual confounding usual.

145
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,330
Usually residual confounding, confounding
would give us spurious relationships

146
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,220
in the range of like a 0.6 to 1.6 hazard
ratio, so

147
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:45,246
this is probably beyond the range we would
expect for just residual con founding.
