1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,940
[SOUND]
This

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,940
is chapter two on our series on homologous
recombination, and what this is, is

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:19,270
going to be a description of how holiday
junctions are resolved.

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:29,250
So I'm starting out with a diagram showing
the formation of two Holliday junctions,

5
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,200
following a double-strand break in the
blue chromosome, and

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,750
the formation of the Holliday junctions,
by forming a D-loop in conjunction with

7
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,920
the intact red chromosome, which did not
have double-strand break.

8
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:50,860
I've colored the DNA carefully according
to the sequences that were copied so

9
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,580
that when, when a sequence was copied from
three time over

10
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,160
pane of the blue chromosome for example,
right here, but

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,160
it was copying off of the right chromosome
by drawing red and similarly down here.

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,130
Where there's three prime end for

13
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,190
the blue chromosome that was then used as
the primer for

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,330
synthesising DNA from the red chromosome
so that's all in red.

15
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,288
So this is two holiday junctions.

16
00:01:21,288 --> 00:01:28,360
Now, holiday junctions can be resolved by
making cleavages, because

17
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,910
this two chromosomes are now attached by
the DNA at two different locations, and

18
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:42,370
so, one way of making the cleavages is by
making two longitudinal cuts.

19
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,528
So, I'm going to draw in.

20
00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:50,760
They cut here.

21
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,320
'Kay.
That's a pair of longitudinal cuts,

22
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,370
and I can draw pair of longitudinal cuts
here, and

23
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:06,470
here, and if I do make those cuts, then
all I have to do is take.

24
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:12,770
The three prime end of the blue chromosome
up here, and join it to

25
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:18,120
the five prime end of this red piece of
DNA.

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:25,100
So, that as a result of those two cuts, I
am now going to have the following.

27
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,160
So we're going to draw that in, and I'll
have the red chromosome.

28
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,220
The red DNA and now the blue DNA.

29
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:42,163
So the three prime end, the five prime
end, and now I"ll put in what happens

30
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:48,090
to the upper strand, the upper DNA here,
the upper piece of DNA.

31
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,665
I'm going to have the three prime end over
here, and

32
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:59,372
we're going to come over here, and we're
going to come

33
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:06,152
up to a cut on that strand, and that cut
will allow ligation.

34
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:15,470
At this point let's continue, with the
cuts at the other Holliday junction.

35
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:21,370
So this bottom strand on the upper
chromosome is going to end up

36
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,070
being joined right at this point.

37
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:27,810
Okay.

38
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,750
[BLANK_AUDIO]

39
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,150
After those cuts, now, let's draw, the,
re,

40
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,130
resolution of the Holliday junction, and
how it affects, the bottom chromosome, and

41
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,220
as you can see, I'll draw this for you the
bottom strand of the bottom chromosome,

42
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,000
of course, is intact; nothing was ever
done to it.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,830
But the upper strand, of course, after the
cuts.

44
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,700
[BLANK_AUDIO]

45
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:02,440
What will happen is red DNA will get
ligated to red DNA and

46
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,426
maybe a little bit of blue here, but then,
that will be ligated to the red DNA.

47
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:15,944
Just so, okay?

48
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:23,330
So, the bottom strand of DNA here is
going to be virtually completely red.

49
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:28,150
So the intact, the original intact DNA is,
is been restored.

50
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,840
After the resolution of the holiday
junction.

51
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:39,000
The difference is the upper strand, the
upper DNA molecule.

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,310
Now has been repaired by copying from the
intact chromosome, and

53
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,110
that's the areas that were copied are
shown in red here,

54
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,910
and this kind of resolution of the holiday
junction

55
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,170
actually converts some of the sequence in
the blue chromosome to a red sequence, and

56
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,920
if the sequences aren't exactly the same
you're going to have a slight difference.

57
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,350
Of course since this is homologous
recombination,

58
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,650
the sequences are pretty close to the same
but.

59
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,980
There will be some differences depending
on whether the blue chromosome and

60
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,350
the red chromosome have exactly the same
sequences, and

61
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:25,059
because they're slightly different, we
call this process here gene conversion.

62
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:30,222
So, the damaged chromosome has undergone a
gene conversion.

63
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:35,770
All right, now, there is a different

64
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,710
way you can resolve the holiday junctions,
and we're now going to talk about that.

65
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:46,070
So I'm going to erase this way of
repairing or

66
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:53,500
resolving the two holiday junctions, and
show you a different way to resolve them.

67
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,350
So let's get the eraser.

68
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,290
Get rid of gene conversion here, and,
let's see,

69
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:07,245
I'm going to be judicious in how I do
this, because, I'm going to make

70
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:09,750
[BLANK_AUDIO]

71
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,220
one pair of cuts the same.

72
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,680
And so one pair of cuts will still be

73
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,970
these longitudinal cuts that I drew
previously.

74
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,340
But the other pair of cuts are going to be
transverse cuts.

75
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,870
Here are the transverse cuts.

76
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:32,970
All right, now as a result of those
transverse cuts.

77
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,210
I'm going to have a different species.

78
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,030
So, let me erase things here.

79
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,838
Let's see, let's clean this thing up a
little bit.

80
00:06:41,838 --> 00:06:46,660
Let's get rid of that.

81
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,710
Now, we're going to make this transverse
cuts,

82
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,220
and I'm going to show them to you here.

83
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,360
Where the cuts are.

84
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,110
So imagine that this enzyme here nicks the
DNA,

85
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,900
boom, there it goes, and boom, there it
goes.

86
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:08,700
Lemme restore that arrow so you can
remember where the cut was.

87
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,760
There you go, and so, that is where the
transverse cuts are.

88
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,060
Now, keeping track of the three prime, and
five prime ends, all right.

89
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:26,179
There's going to be a three prime end over
here,

90
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:34,495
okay, and a five prime end on this side of
the cut,

91
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:41,380
all right, and, there is no cut here.

92
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,960
So this is still okay, and, there is no
cut over here.

93
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,630
So this is still okay.

94
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,990
All right

95
00:07:51,990 --> 00:08:02,690
[BLANK_AUDIO]
But there was a cut down here, so

96
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:10,240
I'm going to re-draw it for you.

97
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,290
Drawing in the five [UNKNOWN].

98
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:16,090
So, I've made these two cuts, I have four
single stranded ends, and

99
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:22,087
those have to be rejoined in a [UNKNOWN],
re-combinational way.

100
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:29,100
So, this three prime end is going to end
up joined to this five prime end,

101
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,090
and this three prime end is going to be
joined to this five prime end.

102
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:34,810
So let me denote that

103
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:42,160
in the following way, just so we can keep
track of book keeping.

104
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:48,610
I'm going to make a triangle here, because
this three prime end.

105
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,842
Is going to be joined to this five prime
end.

106
00:08:53,842 --> 00:09:00,450
That's a triangle and it's too red pieces
of DNA, okay,

107
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:08,490
and then I'm going to make, a circle over
here to denote.

108
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,740
Which two ends are going to be joined.

109
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,490
So, the circles will be joined,

110
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,380
one circle from the red DNA and one circle
from the blue DNA.

111
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,940
So, that's how these things are going to
be joined.

112
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,300
So now, all we have to do redraw this sort
of unfolding things and

113
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,190
the way we can unfold things.

114
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,160
Is we can flip this strand and this strand
over and let me just draw an arrow for

115
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,450
you so that there's going to be a flip
between these two,

116
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:45,110
and I'm going to show you how that's looks
as a result.

117
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:53,350
What you're going to see now, this is the
first half

118
00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:00,760
and then this is going to be that triangle
on the upper strand,

119
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,490
that's going to be joined to the triangle
in the lower strand after the flipping.

120
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,220
Okay.

121
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,454
[BLANK_AUDIO]

122
00:10:13,454 --> 00:10:19,017
And this piece of DNA

123
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:24,251
[BLANK_AUDIO]

124
00:10:24,251 --> 00:10:32,600
and flipped over at this end.

125
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,870
Is intact, nothing has happened to it.

126
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,900
So that's the five prime end.

127
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,030
That's now the new upper DNA.

128
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:47,105
[BLANK_AUDIO]

129
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:51,440
And now the lower DNA I'm going to draw in
here

130
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,402
[BLANK_AUDIO]

131
00:10:57,402 --> 00:11:02,242
[INAUDIBLE]

132
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:05,500
Prime end and

133
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:13,179
here is the five prime end of the lower
DNA.

134
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:21,320
All right, remember, that's going to be
joined to the circle on the upper strands,

135
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,330
so I'm flip that over to the blue DNA.

136
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,840
So, I'm going to actually make a little
blue circle, so

137
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,220
you can see they came together.

138
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:34,402
[BLANK_AUDIO]

139
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:39,520
All right, and actually, let me draw it
just so you can see that there are two

140
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,580
triangles here and two circles on the
bottom.

141
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,880
So now you have two chromosomes that have
been restored, and

142
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,610
they've been separated by resolution of
the Holliday junction.

143
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,070
The resolution occurred because of a
longitudinal cut.

144
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:00,070
At this holiday junction, and a transverse
cut at this holiday junction, and

145
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,100
as a result of the combination of the
longitudinal cut and

146
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:09,000
the transverse cut, okay, what I end up
with is a chromosome,

147
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,380
an upper chromosome here that starts out
blue and ends up red, and

148
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,930
a lower chromosome, here, that starts out
red and ends up blue, and, so,

149
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:26,621
that is not an easy thing to draw, so we
have congratulate ourselves and say voila.

150
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:32,520
All right, what is this product called?

151
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,280
This product.

152
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,760
This method of, or this particular way of
resolving the two holiday junctions.

153
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,960
These products are now called a
cross-over.

154
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:49,208
So, I'll just write that, cross-over, from
homologous recombination.

155
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,470
Okay, that was very complicated, but if
you keep track of the five prime and

156
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,690
three prime ends of the DNA, you should be
fine.

157
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,760
So thank you very much.
