>> Hi, I'm Dr. Larry Chu.

00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,880

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,110
>> And on behalf of The Stanford
Anesthesia and Informatics Lab or AIM Lab.

7
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,150
I want to thank you for

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,120
spending your time with us to learn, about
the essentials of geriatric anesthesia and

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,010
more importantly, the perioperative
management of our elderly patients.

10
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,660
This is really an area of growing
importance in anesthesia as we

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,580
have many more patients who are elderly
coming in for

12
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,380
surgery, for surgical interventions in the
later parts of their life.

13
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,310
And so, I, I really hope that you will let
your colleagues as

14
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,820
well know about this resource, especially
if you've found useful for yourself.

15
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,750
You know, Kevin Jenner you, he is a,

16
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,090
an anesthesia resident for the Medical
College of Wisconsin.

17
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,160
He came here to the AIM Lab for

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,350
a month long research rotation where we
created this project together.

19
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,260
Kevin, I want to give you a moment to
thank people who made

20
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,150

26
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:50,040
And I'd also like to thank the DW Reynolds

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,830
in this project through a generous grant
from the Medical College of Wisconsin for

28
00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:00,430
the furtherance of medical education in
the area of geriatrics.

29
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,310
>> Again, thank you so much for
participating in this course with us.

30
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,205
