00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,870
[BLANK_AUDIO].

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,556
In this next module I'm going to be giving
you sort of the 30,000 foot overview of

3
00:00:09,556 --> 00:00:10,740
mixed models.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,370
So before I delve into any of the
mathematical details I

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,770
just want to tell you how mixed models fit
in with generalized estimating equations.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,340
And also, I want to point out that there
are actually two different ways to

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,160
handle repeated measures data from within
a mixed model.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,810
So what's the difference between a
generalized estimating equation and

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,070
a mixed model?

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,540
So first of all, obviously both of them
can handle correlated data such as

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,520
repeated measures data.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,600
The key difference is that mixed models
can incorporate what

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,570
are called random effects whereas GEE
models cannot.

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,790
So mixed models are actually called mixed.

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,510
Because they include both what are called
fixed effects and random effects.

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,260
Fixed effects are our normal effects that
we've been dealing up with until now.

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,250
Random effects allow you to do things like
have

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,100
subject specific intercepts in slopes.

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,960
So we are going to be handling repeated
measures data

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,350
with subject specific effects.

21
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,665
GEE models cannot handle those, so they
are only estimating

22
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:14,210
population-average effects rather than
subject-specific effects.

23
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,329
And for that reason they're sometimes also
called marginal models.

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,730
So that's the major difference between
mixed models and GEE.

25
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,030
Another major difference is that GEE and

26
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,190
mixed models actually use different
estimation techniques.

27
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:31,280
So, as we saw last week, GEE uses what's
called quasi-likelihood estimation,

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,014
that's the reason that for our fifth
statistics we got QICs rather than AICs.

29
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:41,060
In contrast mixed models uses maximum
likelihood estimation actually.

30
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,910
Restricted maximum likelihood estimation
but

31
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,850
that's very similar to maximum likelihood
estimation.

32
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,540
And we will be getting out our normal AIC
model fit statistics.

33
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,380
Because these two modeling techniques use
slightly different estimation methods.

34
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,870
We will get slightly different parameter
estimates and P-values and such.

35
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,980
The other thing I want to point out is
that for when I'm dealing with

36
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,610
continuous outcomes, I tend to choose
mixed models for various reasons.

37
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,560
And there's some advantages when I have
discrete outcomes of picking

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,730
the generalized estimating equations.

39
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,300
So often, the choice of which model that
you're going to use may be related to

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,550
what type of outcome you have.

41
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,050
Now, I just want to give you a broad
overview of what a mixed model looks like.

42
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,290
So first of all,

43
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,550
we are going to be focusing exclusively
this week on continuous outcomes.

44
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,385
As I mentioned, I actually kind of prefer
to use GE models when I,

45
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:36,430
have discrete outcomes.

46
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,192
The other major reason we're going to
focus on continuous outcomes is

47
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:43,500
that we're going to be using the procedure
PROC MIXED in SAS.

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,300
And PROC MIXED only handles continuous
outcomes.

49
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,508
So we're going to be dealing with
continuous outcomes,

50
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:51,490
presumably, roughly normally distributed.

51
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,280
The right hand side of the equation here
looks

52
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,204
an awful lot like all regression models
we've seen before.

53
00:02:58,204 --> 00:02:59,479
The only thing that's new and

54
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,140
different here is the inclusion of these
random effects.

55
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,240
So the fixed effects would correspond to
our normal alphas and

56
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,510
betas in our normal regression models.

57
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,870
And the error term is exactly the same
error term that we've seen in

58
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,780
all the regression models up until now of
the residuals.

59
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,320
The only difference here, the only thing
that's new is the random effects.

60
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,180
Now there are actually two ways to handle
repeated measures data from within

61
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,090
a fixed model.

62
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,310
So let me go over the first of those now.

63
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,850
So the first strategy actually does not
include any random effects in the model.

64
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,045
Instead it handles the within subject
correlation by

65
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:37,104
focusing on the error return, and

66
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:42,920
this is very similar to what we did when
we fit generalized estimating equations.

67
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,690
So remember, with generalized estimating
equation, what we did is to say,

68
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,518
well, normal linear regression assumes
that these errors are independent of

69
00:03:50,518 --> 00:03:51,520
one another.

70
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,390
Clearly that's violated when we have
repeated measures data.

71
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,166
And the way that we handle that with
generalized estimating equations was to

72
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,976
allow the correlation structure to be
something other than independent.

73
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:04,696
To make it be exchangeable or auto
regressive to

74
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:09,680
explicitly estimate the correlations
between different time points.

75
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,330
Well we're going to do basically the same
thing as strategy one in our mixed model.

76
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,120
So if your in SAS and you're using PROC
MIXED.

77
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,580
If you want to fit a correlation matrix
for

78
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,240
the errors, we're going to be including
what's called a repeated statement.

79
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,080
So you would be including a repeated
statement.

80
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,830
And that repeated statement is going to
look very similar to

81
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,280
the repeated statement that we saw in PROC
GENMOD.

82
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,530
You're going to be specifying type equals
where you

83
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,650
specify a particular covariance structure.

84
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,430
We're actually going to be specifying the
covariance structure rather than

85
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,480
the correlation structure but same idea.

86
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,590
So you might specify for

87
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,850
example that you want a compound symmetry
covariance structure.

88
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,620
By explicitly estimating the within
subject correlation,

89
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,680
we are in that way correcting for it.

90
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,020
And so that would involve the repeated
statement in PROC MIXED.

91
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,610
The, we are estimating essentially the
co-variance matrix variance for

92
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,320
the residuals.

93
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,250
And for that reason it is sometimes called
the R matrix.

94
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,330
Or at least in SAS that is called the R
matrix, so

95
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,920
just that you know the terminology in SAS.

96
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,690
So that is one way of dealing with a
repeated measures data, and

97
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,070
it's very akin to what we did in a
generalized estimating equation.

98
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,620
In fact, because we're not fitting any
random effects,

99
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,300
I would call this a marginal model, same
as a GEE model.

100
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,290
All right, so that's one strategy.

101
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,913
The only advantage of PROC MIXED to GE to
PROC GENMOD there are more choices for

102
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:39,410
the types of correlation, covariance
structure that you can specify there.

103
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,710
All right.

104
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,490
So that's started our strategy one.

105
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,820
The second strategy is actually to include
random effects in the model.

106
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,086
To include a random effect for subject,
and allow us to

107
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:56,450
estimate subject specific intercepts and
sometimes subject specific slopes.

108
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:03,793
To do that in PROC MIXED in SAS what you'd
be including is a random statement.

109
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:06,693
And on that random statement you would
specify things like I

110
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:10,780
want a random intercept would be and I
want subject-specific intercepts.

111
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,960
If I want a random slope I always specify
that I want subject specific slopes.

112
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,169
So along with that you also do have to
specify a covariance matrix and

113
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:23,585
I just want to point out that this is a
different covariance matrix than the one

114
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:25,820
we specify for the error terms.

115
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,170
So just to avoid any confusion here
there's a covariance matrix you have to

116
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,110
specify for the random effects because the
random effects themselves will

117
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,730
have a covariance matrix.

118
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,382
That is, in SAS, called the G matrix and

119
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:42,680
I will just usually set that as an
unstructured covariance structure.

120
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,200
Usually there aren't too many parameters
that have to be estimated for

121
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,390
the random effects matrix, and therefore I
would just usually set it

122
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:52,260
as unstructured so I don't have to worry
too much about it.

123
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,851
But I just want to point out that that's
a, you're going to see that on

124
00:06:55,851 --> 00:07:00,077
the random line you have to do a type
equals and specify covariance structure.

125
00:07:00,077 --> 00:07:04,037
That's a different covariance structure,
that's for the random effects, not for

126
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:05,040
the residuals.

127
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,930
So, different things here.

128
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,780
Now, if you put a random effect for

129
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,930
subject into the model, if you include
that, it turns out that you

130
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:19,210
are actually redefining changing what a
residual, what this error term means.

131
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,980
So, once you have put a random effect in
the model.

132
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,270
You have most likely taken care of the
issue of within subject correlation.

133
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,610
That's probably sufficient.

134
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,900
You probably don't have to additionally
put in a repeated statement.

135
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,400
So, once I have a random effect for
subject in the model, then the error

136
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,030
terms are no longer the distance between
an observation and the population average.

137
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,930
These residuals are redefined now and they
become

138
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,500
the distance between an observation and
the mean for a specific subject.

139
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,902
And so, what that usually means is that
these errors are now

140
00:07:53,902 --> 00:07:55,980
reasonably modeled as independent.

141
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,360
And so we don't have to do anything with
them.

142
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,584
Practically what that means is that I do
not need to include in my PROC MIXED,

143
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:04,340
a repeated statement.

144
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,290
Once I have a random statement, usually
that's sufficient.

145
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,220
If I put a repeated statement, I usually
don't have to include a random statement.

146
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,000
In other words, I'm only probably going to
be including either a random

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,610
statement to account for the repeated
measures data,

148
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,250
or a repeated statement, and usually I'm
not going to be including both.

149
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,975
Now if you get to more complicated data
sets that are beyond the scope of

150
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:28,650
this course, there may be occasions where
in fact there is

151
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:34,070
some additional correlation in the error
term that needs to be accounted for.

152
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,090
And then you would have to have both a
random statement and

153
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,840
a repeated statement in the model,

154
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,270
where you would specify the correlation
matrix again of the aura matrix.

155
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,460
But again those examples are beyond the
scope of this course so for

156
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,790
our purposes, it's going to be sufficient
to have one or the other of those.

157
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,920
Since we already fit GE models which is
essentially are very similar to

158
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,190
using the repeated statement in PROC
MIXED, I am going to focus this week on

159
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,079
adding the random effects rather than
focusing on the repeated statement.

160
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,520
So I'll be ref, focusing on the random
statement in PROC MIXED.

161
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,284
So again in this module, I just want to go
over how to fit

162
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:16,420
those marginal models with PROC MIXED and
then after this module,

163
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,540
I'll be focusing on that random statement
I'm putting in the random effects.

164
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,493
So PROC MIXED has a repeated statement
similar to PROC GENMOD, which allows you

165
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:28,180
to specify a covariance structure for the
within-person correlation.

166
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,144
It allows you to specify the covariance
matrix for the residuals for

167
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:32,920
the R this is what SAS calls the R matrix.

168
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,290
If you use PROC MIXED with a repeated
statement you're actually going to

169
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,860
get very similar results.

170
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,620
To when you use PROC GENMOD with a
repeated statement,

171
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,840
they are both fitting marginal models.

172
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,470
There are no random effects.

173
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,260
So therefore, you know, they're kind of
doing the same thing.

174
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,036
Now, if you do with the same data set you
fit those two models in MIXED and

175
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:54,809
GENMOD and you choose the same correlation
structure,

176
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:57,720
you will actually get slightly different
answers.

177
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,400
Because, as I pointed out before,

178
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,840
the two modeling techniques are using
different estimation methods.

179
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,258
One is using quasi-likelihood, the other
is using maximum likelihood.

180
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:09,014
And then the other reason, at least off
the bat you're going to

181
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:11,822
get slightly different answers is that the
default is to give you

182
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:14,788
the robust standard errors in generalized
estimating equations.

183
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:18,599
In PROC GENMOD and SAS you get the robust
standard error is by default.

184
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:21,811
Whereas, in PROC MIXED, the default is to
give you the model-based standard error,

185
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:25,111
so since you're getting slightly different
standard errors, at least if you don't ask

186
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:28,090
for them in PROC MIXED, again you're
going to get slightly different answers.

187
00:10:30,098 --> 00:10:32,378
If you want to fit a marginal model
however, and

188
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:36,083
you have a continuous outcome, even though
GEE is doing something similar,

189
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:40,320
I would actually recommend that you use
PROC MIXED to fit the marginal model.

190
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,950
And the reason is, is that PROC MIXED
offers many more choices for

191
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,260
the covariance, the structure of the
covariance matrix.

192
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,990
There's very limited choices in your
generalized estimating equations.

193
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,490
So for example PROC MIXED gives you the
power, in generalized estimating equations

194
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,560
we were actually talking about the
correlation structure.

195
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,130
We never did anything with the variances
with for each time point.

196
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,250
We did PROC MIXED, so the variance is
like, image you have three time points.

197
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,590
Make this a little bigger.

198
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,250
So imagine that I've got three time
points.

199
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,730
Time one, time two, and time three.

200
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,480
When we're estimating the covariance and
the correlation.

201
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,040
We have correlation between every two time
points.

202
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,160
So, you know, if I have an exchangeable
correlation matrix that looks like that.

203
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,887
But I also have the variance at each time
point.

204
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:31,318
And one of the assumption,

205
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:34,290
one of the things we've been assuming is
that variance is equal.

206
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,100
So the variance of the outcome at time one
is equal to the variance of the outcome at

207
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,770
time two, is equal to the variance of the
outcome at time three.

208
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,470
That's that homogeneity of variances
assumption.

209
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,942
Well, we didn't have a way to deal with
that in PROC GENMOD but

210
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:50,220
actually in PROC MIXED, you can choose to
make those variances heterogeneous and

211
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,170
actually to fit three separate variances,
you have that option.

212
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,032
Another additional option that you have in
PROC MIXED, is

213
00:11:57,032 --> 00:12:00,812
you can actually allow different groups,
like the treated and the control group,

214
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:04,376
to actually have different values for
their covariance structures their, so

215
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:07,640
for their correlation coefficients and
their variances.

216
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,940
And so, there's some flexibility there
that doesn't exist in PROC GENMOD.

217
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,106
So, generally again if,

218
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,551
even if you want to fit a marginal model,
I would do it from within PROC MIXED if

219
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:18,480
you've got a continuous outcome rather
than from PROC GENMOD.

220
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,235
But just to show you that you get very
similar results last week we fit a GEE

221
00:12:24,235 --> 00:12:29,080
model for the spine bone density data with
these three groups, black, red and blue.

222
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,240
And here are the results.

223
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,467
We went over these results last week.

224
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:34,476
We saw that the time by group interaction
was significant for

225
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:37,957
both of the, the black and the red group
compared with the blue group,

226
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,494
saying that they do have a higher rate of
change of,

227
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:44,450
of spine bone density over time than the
blue group as we can see in the picture.

228
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,760
I'll just point out the P-values here are
0.0456, 0.0057.

229
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,422
The point estimates are 0.0108, 0.0140.

230
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:56,090
If you scroll across, you can see you can,
there's a lot of different estimates here.

231
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,323
But I went ahead and fit that same data in
a PROC MIXED, but for

232
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:05,950
the, asking for the marginal model, using
the repeated statement.

233
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:11,280
And in this, these results, I had chosen
an exchangeable correlation matrix.

234
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,590
So for PROC MIXED, I went ahead and chose
compound symmetry.

235
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:19,670
Compound symmetry means exchangeable
correlation plus, that the same,

236
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,370
the variance is, at different time points
are all the same homogeneity of variances.

237
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,000
So I went ahead and chose compound
symmetry.

238
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,640
I also, specifically requested a robust
standard error just to

239
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,530
get these as similar as possible.

240
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,520
I just want to show you that you get
pretty much the same results.

241
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,915
So, the P-values are 0.4, 0.0491, rather
than 0.0456,

242
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:44,952
0.007 rather than 0.0057, 0.01079 rather
than 0.0108.

243
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:47,250
I mean these are really, really close.

244
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,410
We are in the third decimal place before
you see any difference.

245
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,160
So these models are very much essentially
doing the same thing.

246
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,515
Again, I slightly prefer PROC MIXED here
because you have more flexibility for

247
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:00,900
that correlation covariance structure.

248
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,410
I am actually going to show you some SAS
code this week, just because there's a lot

249
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,220
of different ways of modelling these
things, and it can be a little confusing.

250
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,910
And sometimes just seeing the code can
help clarify what we're talking about.

251
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,595
So again, last week we did generalized
estimating equations, with PROC GENMOD.

252
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:22,100
Using the repeated statement to specify
the structure of the correlation matrix.

253
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,929
We can do a similar marginal model in PROC
MIXED,

254
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:27,920
by using the repeated statement in PROC
MIXED.

255
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,660
The syntax looks very similar to PROC
GENMOD, a few differences in the syntax.

256
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,442
And we can there specify again, the core,
same correlation matrix, and

257
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,417
we are getting a mixed a marginal model
out this way.

258
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:41,948
We're going to get similar results.

259
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,380
Again with, with some slight advantages
for PROC MIXED in terms of choices for

260
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,750
your covariance structure.

261
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,469
