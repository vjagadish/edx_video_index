1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,330
In this next module, I'm going to
introduce you to parametric regression,

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,454
specifically exponential and [UNKNOWN]
regression [SOUND].

3
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:20,700
So where are we now on our statistical
chart, tests for survival data.

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,760
So if we have time to event data, last
week we talked about descriptive methods.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,130
Such as the rate ratio [SOUND], incidence
rates and Kaplan-Meier statistic.

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,530
In this week, we are moving towards
regression and of course we

7
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,640
want to be able to do regression so that
we can accommodate multiple predictors,

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,970
continuous predictors and adjust for
things and so on.

9
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,980
So this week I am going to tell you about
parametric regression.

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,200
In parametric regression we're going to be
estimating all the parameters.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,700
So we're actually going to have to assume
that our survival times take on some

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,020
known probability distribution,such as the
exponential [SOUND].

13
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,160
Next week I'll tell you about Cox
regression.

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,830
In Cox regression we're not going to
assume that our

15
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,520
survival times take on any particular
distribution.

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,100
So that's the difference between those two
[SOUND].

17
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,180
So then in parametric regression we have
to make more assumption.

18
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,240
We're going to assume that the survival
times take on some

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,750
known mathematical distribution, such as
the Weibull or the exponential.

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,720
And I'm specifically going to talk about
the Weibull and

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,010
the exponential, but we could assume other
distributions for

22
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,600
the survival time, such as the normal or
logged normal [SOUND].

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,650
We're then going to estimate the
parameters of these distributions.

24
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,780
So for example [SOUND], the exponential
distribution was defined by the fact that

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,110
the hazard function was constant over time
it does not change over time.

26
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,530
So for the exponential we are going to
have to estimate one parameter for

27
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,760
the baseline hazard function because
there's only one hazard function that

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,960
doesn't change over time.

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,047
For the Weibull distribution however
there's an additional parameter that we

30
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:54,966
are going to have to estimate [SOUND].

31
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:58,720
So remember that the hazard function for
the Weibull distribution.

32
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,160
Regression actually is allowed to change
over time.

33
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,540
We are multiplying a constant times time
raised to a power.

34
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,700
If k here is greater than one, the hazard
will be increasing over time,

35
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,450
if k is less than one, the hazard will be
decreasing over time, and

36
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,360
remember is k is one, we'll just be back
on an [UNKNOWN] Exponential.

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,120
So there'll be one additional parameter
that we have to estimate.

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,414
This power is often called the shape
parameter [SOUND].

39
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,080
We'll be estimating these parameters using
maximum likelihood estimation.

40
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,760
So now let me just show you what the model
looks like.

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,280
I'm going to start with the model for

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,120
the exponential regression because that's
the simplest.

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,630
So, we're actually going to be modeling
the hazard function as a function of

44
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,120
predictors of your risk factors.

45
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,260
We're not going to be directly modeling
the hazard function [SOUND].

46
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,460
However, we're actually going to be
modeling the log hazard function.

47
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,210
So you'll notice that it's the log hazard
function that's over

48
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,750
here on the left-hand side of the equation
[SOUND].

49
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,240
We've dealt a lot with logs before.

50
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,010
This is the natural log here that I'm
talking about [SOUND].

51
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,790
We've dealt a lot with logs before.

52
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,200
Logs have nice mathematical properties, so

53
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,938
we're going to deal with logs rather than
the hazard directly [SOUND].

54
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,838
So what's in the exponential model?

55
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:10,960
Well, we going to have an intercept that
looks, the, the right hand side of this

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,000
equation looks like every other regression
model that we've dealt with.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,560
So, we're going to have an intercept,

58
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,820
that will represent here the hazard
function for

59
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,810
the reference group when all of the other
predictors in the model are set to zero.

60
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,050
And then we're going to have some linear
combination of betas and

61
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,680
predictors like we've always had, this
could be age, weight, whatever your

62
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,146
risk factors are, treatment group, that
you want to model the effects of.

63
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:40,570
In this module [SOUND], I'm mostly going
to be focusing on just the intercepts of

64
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,250
this model, and then in the next module
we'll actually add back the predictors.

65
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,940
Let me just show you though essentially
what we are modelling here again we

66
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,370
are modelling the log hazard [SOUND], you
know, the hazard change over time and

67
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,180
indicating it has hazard as a function of
time, but of course for

68
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,880
the exponential it's going to be constant
over time.

69
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,710
Let me just take a simple model.

70
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:05,390
So, imagine that I wanted to have, model
the effect of age on the log hazard.

71
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,810
So, if we had one parameter in the model
that was age,

72
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,460
we are modeling things again as straight
lines so the betas here represent slopes.

73
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,420
The alpha represents dy intercept.

74
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,490
So, if I had a model that just had age in
it.

75
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:24,190
So, my model was alpha plus beta [SOUND]
times age, what I'd essentially be

76
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,110
modeling is I would say there is some
hazard function for a zero-year old.

77
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,000
Of course there, you know, probably not
going to be any zero [INAUDIBLE] in

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,350
my study but that's the intercept, the
reference group.

79
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,580
That's the hazard, the log hazard for that
group and

80
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,870
then as we go up in age, probably, we are
increasing in the hazard or

81
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,440
potentially and we are assuming that there
is a straight line relationship there.

82
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,990
So we'll talk more about the betas again
in the next module but

83
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,830
it's essentially the same.

84
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,290
Same kind of regression model we've been
dealing with all along except our

85
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,774
outcome here is log hazard [SOUND].

86
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,380
Again, I want to focus just on the
intercept for

87
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,380
the purposes of this module, however.

88
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,204
The intercept for the exponential is easy
because it's just a constant [SOUND].

89
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,330
It gets slightly more complicated with the
Weibull Model however, because there is

90
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:14,100
an additional parameter that we have to
estimate to characterize the hazard

91
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,620
function and because the hazard function
[SOUND] for Weibull can change over time.

92
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,280
So recall again that the hazard function
for

93
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,250
a Weibull is just some constant times time
raised to a power.

94
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,780
Well, if I want to model the log of the
hazard function,

95
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,476
I can take the log of both sides here.

96
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:33,510
So the log [SOUND] of the hazard function
then would be the log of

97
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,740
a constant which is just a constant,
that's what it's representing.

98
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,290
Here by alpha plus [SOUND]
the log of this second term, but of course

99
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,070
with logs you can bring the powers down in
front so that's what's happening here.

100
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,640
We're ending up with the log of time with
a power in front.

101
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,420
There's one additional parameter that we
have to estimate which

102
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,210
characterizes is the hazard increases or
decreasing as a function over time.

103
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,230
So now we have a situation.

104
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:04,210
Where if we put time [SOUND] on the x
axis, there's going to be a,

105
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,600
an intercept for an alpha here represents
the intercept.

106
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,010
So that represents the hazard rate at time
equals zero, at baseline, and

107
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,050
then that hazard rate [SOUND] or log
hazard rate.

108
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,936
Is allowed to change as a function of time
[SOUND].

109
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:24,310
[SOUND] And again we then can additionally
talk about how do [SOUND]

110
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,840
certain predictors increase or decrease.

111
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,976
Your hazard rate but we are not going to
add that in right now for,

112
00:06:29,976 --> 00:06:32,608
for in this model we're going to be
focussing [SOUND] just on

113
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:35,860
that baseline hazard function without any
predictors in the model.

114
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,880
It's once we are spending a few minutes
here just to go over what does

115
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,480
the likelihood function look like if for
doing parametric regression.

116
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,790
So I'm going to just kind of.

117
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,740
Conceptually put out right out a, a very
simple example for a likelihood function.

118
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,760
Just to give you a sense of what the
likelihood function looks like here.

119
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,850
The likelihood function for the parametric
models will have one probability,

120
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,820
one term in it for each person and each
observation in the study.

121
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,640
I am assuming all of you have seen maximum
likelihood estimation before so

122
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,550
that you're familiar with the concept of
the likelihood function.

123
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,070
So again, I'm going to use a really really
simple example here.

124
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,910
Imagine that we're trying to fit a model.

125
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,990
The log hazard rate,

126
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,800
this is an exponential model, so the log
hazard is equal to

127
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,850
alpha the reference hazard rate plus a
single binary predictor in the model.

128
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,240
So x is either equal to one or zero we
have one beta in the.

129
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,040
In the model, very simple exponential
model.

130
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,230
So again, the likelihood [SOUND],
remember, is the probability of our data.

131
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,420
We're actually going to write out a
probability function that

132
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,090
gives the probability of our data and in
this case we're going to

133
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:44,350
have one term in the likelihood for every
person in our study.

134
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,540
[SOUND] And what are those terms actually
going to look like [SOUND]?

135
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,500
So I'll write it out, it won't write out
completely but kind of give you a sense of

136
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,200
it, so there is two types of people in our
data set, for time to event outcomes.

137
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,210
There are people who had the event, I'm
going to write died here, but of course

138
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,210
it, the outcome doesn't have to be death,
it could be some other event [SOUND].

139
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,650
But people who died or had whatever the
event was, and we have people who

140
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,230
are censored, meaning the last time we saw
them, they had not yet had the event.

141
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,140
They had not yet died or whatever the
event might be.

142
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,450
So, depending on which of those two
categories somebody falls in,

143
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,410
they're going to get different Terms in
the likelihood.

144
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,300
So somebody who actually died, who
actually had the event.

145
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,640
The probability that they are going to get
in the likelihood is going to be equal to

146
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,560
the [SOUND], their survival probability up
until time t,

147
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,250
the last time we saw than the time at
which they actually had the event.

148
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,920
It's going to be their survival pro,

149
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,640
the probability times [SOUND] the hazard
function, their hazard [SOUND].

150
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,640
So, because they survi, we know that they
survived up until time ti.

151
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,520
That's the time that they died.

152
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,400
They survive up until that time and then
they died at time ti.

153
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,770
So we're representing their probability,
what actually happened, as thei,

154
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,930
their survival probability, their chances
of surviving up until time TI

155
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,980
times their chances of dying right at TI
given that they've survived up to TI.

156
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,350
Remember that's what the hazard function
represents.

157
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,570
So everyone who died will get.

158
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,740
These two probabilities in the model.

159
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,860
And of course these probabilities are
going to be functions of

160
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,560
the alpha and beta.

161
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,190
And I'll fill those in in a minute.

162
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,526
For somebody who's censored [SOUND],

163
00:09:15,526 --> 00:09:19,110
however all we know is that they survived
[SOUND].

164
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,250
Up until the last time that we saw them,
up until the their ti their time to event.

165
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,150
But they didn't die in the next instant,
we don't know what happened next,

166
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,330
so all we are going to put in the model
for them is their probability of

167
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,970
surviving up until time ti, the last time
that they saw them [SOUND].

168
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,190
So they just get the survival probability.

169
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,080
So let me just actually fill in with some.

170
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,880
Show you where the alpha and betas [SOUND]
appear here.

171
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,470
So again if we're on a, an exponential
distribution, we're

172
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,210
adjusting the log [SOUND] of the hazard
function is equal to alpha plus beta if

173
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,420
you were somebody, who have, let's say
this is a treatment in a control group.

174
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,700
So if you have the treatment You get beta
times one.

175
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,530
If you're somebody who's in the control
group who didn't get the treatment,

176
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,110
you only get alpha, because you'll get
beta times zero,

177
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,370
so that term is going to go away.

178
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,690
So there's only kind of two types of
people here [SOUND].

179
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,080
This is the, of course, where we're
modeled the log hazard, so

180
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,430
the hazard function itself I have to
exponentiate both sides [SOUND].

181
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,050
So if I exponentiate both sides [SOUND],

182
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,190
I'm going to show that the hazard function
for

183
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:23,310
a person who had the treatment is going to
be equal to e raised to alpha plus beta.

184
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,560
And the hazard function for somebody.

185
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,950
Who have not had the treatment, who's in
the control group [SOUND].

186
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,190
Again I'm just going to exponentiate both
sides when we erase the alpha.

187
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,610
Now there's something that you need to
know if you're working specifically in

188
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,670
SAS, is that SAS actually require to
negate the alphas and

189
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,900
betas that it gives you out.

190
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,950
So in the output, if you want to translate
from the output into the actual

191
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,850
hazard function, you first need to negate
the model to multiply it by a negative.

192
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,630
So we are actually going to take negative
alpha plus beta,

193
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,370
exponentiate that to get the hazard
function, or negative exponentiate that

194
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,870
to get the hazard function, just a little
detail you need to know.

195
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:03,840
So if I, imagine I'm putting a term in the
model now for somebody who in my data set

196
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,320
who died at twelve months into the study,
so their Time ti is 12 and they died.

197
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
They had the event.

198
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,080
So I'm going to fill in their survival
function [SOUND].

199
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,570
So what's the survival function for an
exponential.

200
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,020
Remember, it's going to be e raised to
negative ht.

201
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,160
That's the survival probability for on an
exponential.

202
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,760
That's the survival function.

203
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,382
And then I can just plug in okay [SOUND],
what was t

204
00:11:26,382 --> 00:11:30,060
they died [SOUND] at 12 months so I'm
going to be plugging in 12 months for

205
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,130
t we wanted their, their probability of
the, of surviving up until time 12.

206
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,820
It's, that's how long they survive.

207
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,870
And then in the hazard function,

208
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,840
we have, let's say that they're in the
control group.

209
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,040
If they're somebody that's in the control
group [SOUND],

210
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,740
then their hazard function is going to be
e raised to negative hazard function, and

211
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,380
remember, hazard function here is e raised
to negative alpha, it's just this.

212
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,610
That's for somebody in the control group.

213
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,750
That's there hazard function.

214
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,280
So I am going to plug in their hazard
function.

215
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,360
So now, we are a, tha likelihood is a
function of alpha.

216
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,910
We also have to plugin a hazard.

217
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,600
So remember that the hazard function,

218
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,730
if I am on an exponential, is just a
constant hazard.

219
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,760
It's just age, well age here [SOUND], is
simply e raised to negative alpha.

220
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,720
So that's for somebody who is in the
control group.

221
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,780
And died at 12 months, I'd put that term
in the model for that.

222
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,670
Now imagine I've got somebody who was
censored the last time we saw them,

223
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,960
they were still alive.

224
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,050
And let's say they were censored at 11
months and

225
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,000
let's say they were in the treatment
group.

226
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,510
So their survival function again is going
to be e raised to negative.

227
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,480
Each t, their t is 11 months.

228
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,100
But their each, their hazard function
[SOUND] now includes beta because there is

229
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,110
somebody in the treatment group, so

230
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:43,730
we would plugin e raise to negative alpha,
minus beta there.

231
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,180
And every person in the data set would get
one of these terms in the model.

232
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,160
That's the basic idea of the likelihood
function here.

233
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,440
We would, of course, then what happens to
this likelihood function.

234
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,460
We take the log of the likelihood
function.

235
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,180
We maximize the likelihood function to
solve for

236
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,050
the alpha and beta to make our data the
most likely.
