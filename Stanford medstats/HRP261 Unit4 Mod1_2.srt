1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,160
In this next module,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,950
I'm going to talk about one of the
assumptions of linear regression that

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,930
you really should test if you've got
continuous predictors in your module.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,000
I think it's often an ignored assumption.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,120
So when you're reading papers you should
look to see whether or not it was tested.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,180
And if you're doing your own data analysis
it would be important to run this test.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
This assumption is something called linear
in the logit.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,390
And it's, it's as simple as just when we
do a linear regression,

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,020
remember what do you want to do of course?

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,390
When you do a linear regression, you
want to do the plot.

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,360
And you want to see if it actually looks
like a line.

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,130
This one looks like a line, here's a
scatter plot that doesn't look like

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,140
a line, it actually looks like a
quadratic.

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,400
So for linear regression, it's really easy
because we can just plot x against y.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,120
We can see immediately if it looks like
the, the scatter plot roughly fits a line.

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,850
For logistic regression we're still
fitting lines but

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,800
it's harder to draw this graphic, because
the outcome, remember,

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,630
is this logit function, and there's no way
to directly see the logit function.

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:13,150
The best you can do, as I did some logit
plots in the first module for this week.

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,750
And how I did that, in order to be able to
do that,

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,020
I had to group people according to their
level of the predictor.

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,360
So I can group people who did the lowest
number amount of homework and, you know,

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,760
like the ten lowest, ten people with the
lowest homework time, and

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,770
then the next ten, and then the next ten.

25
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,830
So I have to somehow group you people in
order that I

26
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,540
can calculate the proportion who've had
the binary outcome.

27
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,100
From that proportion I can then calculate
the logit.

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,420
If you do that, then you can make some
plots.

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,460
But of course the plot's going to depend
slightly on how you bin people,

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,840
how you group people.

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,720
So I'm going to show you in a minute some
examples of testing this,

32
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,010
a linear in the logit assumption and
you'll see that I,

33
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,850
we'll usually run several different graphs
with several different bin sizes so

34
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,070
that I can get a sense of the data
without, you know, being too arbitrary.

35
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,580
And we're looking for that.

36
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,880
What we're testing is that,

37
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,450
if you have a continuous predictor in
logistic regression,

38
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:12,790
what we're doing is we're fitting a line
that says that continuous predictor acts.

39
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,680
Has a linear relationship, roughly, with
the logit of the outcome.

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,960
So you actually want to make that plot as
best you can and

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,010
see if the relationship is really linear.

42
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,680
Or if, maybe it's not.

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,680
If it's something else, if the
relationship looks, you know,

44
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,560
quadratic, that means you're going to have
to model a quadratic variable for x.

45
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,660
You're going to put in an x squared into
the model or you might have to

46
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,520
transform that continuous variable into a
categorical variable.

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,720
It may not be simply fine to just put that
continuous predictor

48
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,640
directly into the model.

49
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,820
Notice, if you have a binary or

50
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,590
a categorical predictor, you do not have
to worry about this assumption.

51
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,330
Because, if you have a binary variable, a
binary predictor,

52
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,260
you're only doing a zero, one.

53
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,490
You've got only two dots therefore, and

54
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,110
anytime you connect two dots it's
automatically a line.

55
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,850
If you've a categorical predictor, you're
going to be dummy coding it, so

56
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,780
you're going to have a series of zero,
ones, those are all going to make lines.

57
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,980
So this is only a worry when you have a
continuous predictor in

58
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,820
logistic regression.

59
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,810
I'm going to show you some real examples
with real data.

60
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,150
Various examples where I have had to draw
linear in the logit plots.

61
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,980
This example was from a data set where the
outcome is heart disease,

62
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,670
the predictor that we're looking at here
called tobacco,

63
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,750
this is the number of cigarettes smoked
per day.

64
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,740
And I grouped the data set up into four
bins as well as ten bins,

65
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,340
just to give us a, a sense of the
relationship between the number of

66
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,680
cigarettes per day and the logit of heart
disease.

67
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,727
And again, I have to group people, what
I'm graphing here is the,

68
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:48,610
I'm graphing their mean cigarettes per
day.

69
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,610
The mean cigarettes per day for

70
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,750
the group against the logit for that
group, the observed logit for that group.

71
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,900
What you can see here is that for this
particular variable,

72
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,130
the number of cigarettes per day, it does
not look linear in the logit.

73
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,500
The relationship between cigarettes per
day and

74
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,480
are, the logit of having heart disease
appears curvealinear.

75
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,390
There tends to be a curved relationship.

76
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,420
In both of these graphics you can see it
that there's sort of

77
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,312
a curved relationship here.

78
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,850
Why is that?

79
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,860
Well think about the variable cigarettes
per day.

80
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,050
You have a bunch of people who smoke zero
cigarettes per day, and

81
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,300
then you've got people increasing on their
cigarettes per day.

82
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,560
What you're seeing in this graphic here,
is when you dump from being a non smoker,

83
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,670
to smoking you know, some little amount
per day,

84
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,910
there's a huge jump in your odds and risk
of getting heart disease,

85
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,630
its a major seed jump, jump But then there
are sort of diminishing returns.

86
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,530
Once you're already a smoker, whether you
smoke a couple of cigarettes per day,

87
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,140
or more, it, you're risk does go up, but
it doesn't go up as steeply.

88
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,160
And then it, when you go from being kind
of a moderate smoker to being a heavy

89
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,000
smoker, your risk also goes up, but it
goes up even less steeply.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,550
So the relationship is really curved,
rather than linear.

91
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,550
How might you account for this?

92
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,510
Probably the best way is to think about
cigarette smoking as

93
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,260
a categorical variable.

94
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,290
You might want to model this as non
smokers versus light to

95
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,320
moderate smokers versus heavy smokers.

96
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,440
And that might be the best way to actually
model this.

97
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,200
This is the.
This might be a case where it

98
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,210
makes sense to treat tobacco smoking,

99
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,640
cigarettes per day, as a categorical
variable, rather than continuous, so

100
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,535
that's an example that violated the linear
in the logit assumption.

101
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:30,040
Here's an example where we're actually
meeting the linear in the logit assumption

102
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:36,460
pretty well, this was some data that I had
on women athletes.

103
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,640
And the outcome variable here is low bone
mineral density.

104
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,160
So, low skeletal strength.

105
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,820
It turns out that women athletes sometimes
don't menstruate normally.

106
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,940
And, if you don't have normal menses, that
actually can reduce your,

107
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,430
your skeletal strength, your, your bone
mineral, bone mineral density.

108
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,410
So that, this was a dataset looking at
that.

109
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,020
Again, I did too many earlier in the logit
part, so

110
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,180
I'm getting a sense depending on how I bin
things,

111
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,880
how many people per group that I'm getting
the right relationships.

112
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,160
So I grouped into about 12 bins as well as
five bins.

113
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,080
And you can see that there's, of course,
more local noise when you have 12 bins,

114
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,200
but the pattern looks pretty similar in
both cases.

115
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,760
I would say that this is pretty close to
fitting the line.

116
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,850
It's not a perfect line but

117
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,950
it looks like it actually is reasonably
linear in the logit.

118
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,390
In both cases, you can imagine kind of
drawing a line,

119
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,120
again with lots of points there's going to
be some local variability.

120
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,230
But essentially that's well fit by a line.

121
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,920
So, in this case our predictor variable
here is the number of menses,

122
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,800
the number of menstrual periods per year.

123
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,400
So where, you know, normal is sort of
around 12.

124
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,810
A lot of women athletes are having many
less than that.

125
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,410
And it turns out there's a linear
relationship here.

126
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:52,870
As the number of menstrual periods goes
up, from zero all the way up to a normal

127
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,970
of 12, the chances, the odds of getting
low, of having low bone density go down.

128
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,490
And it appears to be well modeled as
linear, so

129
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,600
I could put the number of natural cycles
per year in as the predictor variable and

130
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,770
get an odds ratio for every one unit
increase in menstrual,

131
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:15,010
in menses, how does that decrease my odds
of getting low bone marrow density.

132
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,250
This one seems reasonably modeled as a
linear variable.
