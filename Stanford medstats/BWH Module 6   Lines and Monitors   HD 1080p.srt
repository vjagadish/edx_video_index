2
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,939
Hi I'm Larry Cheu.

3
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,152
>> Hi I'm Carly Guthrie.

4
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:31,300
>> And in this segment we're going to
learn about lines and

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,550
monitors and what you need to know for
cardiac anesthesia.

6
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,940
So Carly, tell me a little bit about what
students can expect to learn from you and

7
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,630
your lecture in this module.

8
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,480
>> So, what students should expect to
learn from this module is,

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,470
the indications, and the reasons why you
should put in an arterial line, and

10
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,170
the central line, and we'll also go
through some of the basics of what is

11
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,310
in a kit and how you can expect to set
that up so you're prepared for

12
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,955
your first day in cardiac anesthesia.

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,840
>> Wonderful.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,850
Well you know, one of the things that
people really get experienced with,

15
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,250
on cardiac anesthesia, is line placement.

16
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,800
Is learning how to do the,

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,630
get a lot of experience in doing central
lines, and doing arterial lines.

18
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,830
So let's, let's dive in and watch the
lecture.

19
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,490
>> Hi, my name is Carly Guthrie and

20
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,599
today we're going to talk about placement
of Arterial and central lines.

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,490
First, let's start by talking about
arterial lines.

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,730
Some of the indications for arterial line
placement include the need for

23
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,850
continuous direct blood pressure
monitoring.

24
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,810
Or if your indirect blood pressure
monitoring fails,

25
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,990
it means your frequent arterial blood gas
sampling.

26
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,310
Or measurement of the blood glucose or
chemistries.

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,420
Let's talk about the arterial line
waveform.

28
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,660
First of all, any time you're replacing an
arterial line you

29
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,330
should place it under sterile conditions.

30
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,940
The waveform that you'll see once you
place the arterial line

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,250
will show a high pressure.

32
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,340
Which corresponds to the systolic
pressure, as seen in the image to

33
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,370
the right, and the lowest pressure, which
will correspond to the diastolic pressure.

34
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,810
The mean arterial pressure is a calculated
number, and

35
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,770
it's calculated by the equation, MAP is
equal to 2 times the diastolic pressure.

36
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,000
Plus the systolic pressure, divided by 3.

37
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,520
Additionally, you'll notice that the wave
form has a small dip or

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,710
the dicrotic notch or incisura, which will
coincide with the aortic valve closure.

39
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,630
You can see that also on the image to the
right.

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,980
That about sums up arterial lines, now
let's talk about central lines.

41
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,990
Indications for central line placement
include,

42
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,510
any patient in which you will need to use
vasopressors.

43
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,069
Patients that may have difficult
peripheral access.

44
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,090
Measurement of the central venus pressure,

45
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,900
especially anytime you'll have hypovolemia
or large fluid shifts during the case.

46
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,270
The administration of TPN or

47
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:15,510
hemodialysis, and anytime you'll need to
do frequent blood draws.

48
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,060
Normal CVP values.

49
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,100
Will be 5 to 10 centimeters of water in a
spontaneously breathing patient, and

50
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,420
3 to 5 centimeters higher, in a
mechanically ventilated patient.

51
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,020
In a normal patient, we believe that the
CVP or

52
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,000
Central Venus Pressure, closely
corresponds to the left atrial pressure,

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,530
and therefore, to left ventricular end
diastolic pressure.

54
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,030
However, this is true only in the absence
of right ventricular dysfunction,

55
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,090
in the absence of abnormal pulmonary
vascular resistance, and

56
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,990
in the absence of valvular disease.

57
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,590
Let's go through the CVP waveform.

58
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,050
First of all, the A wave corresponds to
the atrial contraction at end diastole.

59
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,240
The C wave is due to isovolemic right
ventricular contraction.

60
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,970
When the, tricuspid valve closes and
bulges back into the right atrium.

61
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,360
This occurs in early systole.

62
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,320
You'll notice that the C wave occurs after
the QRS oh the EKG and

63
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,240
the A wave occurs after the P wave.

64
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,910
The V wave is caused by filling of the
atrium with blood from the vena cava.

65
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,010
This happens while the tricuspid valve is
closed during late systole.

66
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,900
There are two descents.

67
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,160
Firstly the X descent is caused by atrial
relaxation,

68
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,570
which causes a decline in atrial pressure
during ventricular contraction.

69
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,430
This occurs in mid systole, so

70
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,310
you'll notice it occurs just before the T
wave of the EKG.

71
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,850
The Y descent is caused by a decrease in
atrial pressure as the tricuspid valve

72
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,240
opens and blood begins flowing from the
right atrium into the right ventricle.

73
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,380
Some tips to remember when you're looking
at CVP waveforms.

74
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,160
First of all, three of the waveform parts
are systolic events, the c,

75
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,280
the x, and the v.

76
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,710
Two of the waveform portions are diastolic
events,

77
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,190
this is the a wave and the y descent.

78
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,250
We use the EKG to properly identify the
parts of the waveform and

79
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,010
where they occur with reference to the
cardiac cycle.

80
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,530
The terms systole and diastole always
refer to ventricular events.

81
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,500
Lets move on and talk about pulmonary
artery catheters.

82
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,140
Pulmonary Artery Catheters are
triple-lumen catheters which have

83
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,940
a proximal port, for measuring the right
atrial pressure and distal port for

84
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,160
measuring the pulmonary artery pressure,
and a thermistor for

85
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,400
calculating cardiac output by
thermodilution.

86
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,010
Some values that you can get directly from
you PAC line include the cardiac output.

87
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:01,860
CVP, the right ventricular pressure,
pulmonary artery pressure, and

88
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,476
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

89
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:09,810
Also, you can get SvO2 and temperature
directly from your PAC line.

90
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,130
Indirect measurements include the cardiac
index,

91
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,490
the stroke volume resistance, and the
stroke volume.

92
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,310
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is used
to approximate left ventricular end

93
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,060
diastolic pressure.

94
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,870
Again, some normal values include a CVP of
0 to 8 millimeters of mercury,

95
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,410
right ventricular pressure of 15 to 30
over 0 millimeters of mercury,

96
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,580
pulmonary artery pressure of 15 to 30 over
5 to 15 millimeters of mercury.

97
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,650
And a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
of 5 to 15 millimeters of mercury.

98
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,390
Indications for pulmonary artery catheter
placement include significant left

99
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,600
ventricular or right ventricular
dysfunction, significant valvular heart

100
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,760
disease, pulmonary hypertension, if you
think you'll have a long operative or

101
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,920
bypass time, or a recent or a current MI.

102
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,590
Again let's go through the waveform that
you may see with pulmonary artery

103
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,460
catheter placement.

104
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,338
You can see the waveform to the image to
the right.

105
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:19,550
As you path, pass through, first the right
atrium, then the right ventricle,

106
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,960
pulmonary artery, and then, when you
finally wedge your catheter.

107
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,800
Typical depths of catheter insertion from
the right IJ access include the right

108
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,040
atrium at 20 to 25 centimeters, the right
ventricle at 30 to 35 centimeters,

109
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,120
the pulmonary artery at 40 to 45
centimeters, and

110
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,820
the wedge at 45 to 55 centimeters.

111
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:46,120
The corresponding waveforms, as you see
there, the right atrium,

112
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,640
and then you'll have a large increase in
your systolic pressure when you

113
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,900
go into the right ventricle.

114
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,220
The pulmonary artery will then have a
increase in your diastolic pressure, and

115
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,795
then the wedge pressure will have
decreases in pressure as you can see.

116
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:04,060
[NOISE]
That concludes our brief

117
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,870
discussion of central lines, pulmonary
artery catheters and arterial lines.

118
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,770
Thank you very much for your attention.

119
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,770
Please feel free to see the corresponding
video about how to

120
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,300
place them and kit setups.

121
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,190
Thank you again, very much.

122
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,090
>> Carly, that was a great lecture, thank
you so much.

123
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,030
I, I do want to ask you though,

124
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,720
what if our viewers out there really
want to get more of

125
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,010
a sense of how this is actually done on
real patients, how lines are placed.

126
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,770
What can we do to help them?

127
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,350
>> Sure we thought of that.

128
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,740
So what we would like you to do now is go
to New England Journal of

129
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,610
Medicine's website, and look for

130
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,580
their, their examples on how to place
arterial and central lines.

131
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,060
And then we will come back and talk, talk
more about it.

132
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,300
>> Okay, great, and we put those links on
the course website, so you can click

133
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,000
through those links now, and then when
you're finished viewing those videos, come

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,220
back and we're going to show you how the
kits look, that we use for placing lines.

135
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,400
So we'll see you in a little bit.

136
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:08,334
[BLANK_AUDIO]

137
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:17,420
Great, well Carley, we have a kit right
here in front of us.

138
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,460
Why don't you go through it for me and
show me some of the features.

139
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,790
>> Sure, so this is how I like to set up
my arterial line kits.

140
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,900
I use the board to place under the
patient's arm to keep it in

141
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,170
the correct position.

142
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,840
Then I clean it with a sterile cleaning
solution, and

143
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,150
cover it with a sterile drape.

144
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,550
This is our arterial catheter that we use.

145
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,650
Yours may differ at your institution.

146
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,570
At ours it's similar to our IV catheters,

147
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,930
in which it has the small plastic catheter
over the needle.

148
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,830
Once you insert that into the artery, you
can then put a line a,

149
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,510
the wire through the plastic portion,
collecting any blood that may

150
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:59,740
spill out in the gauze, and once the line
is in, then you connect the soft

151
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,320
plastic portion to the sterile saline
flush that you have preset up.

152
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,110
If you're doing your arterial line under
awake conditions, you can use

153
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,420
the lidocaine drawn up with a straw, and
use a small bore needle to inject it so

154
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,520
the patient is comfortable while you're
doing the procedure.

155
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,120
We then have a sterile adhesive locking
device, and

156
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,320
a sterile ecclusive dressing that you
place over the arterial line once it's in

157
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,800
place, and, and the saline has been
flushed.

158
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:31,080
>> Okay Carly, well looks like we have
another kit in front of us.

159
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,450
This one looks like it's for a central
line.

160
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,260
Why don't you take us through it?

161
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,000
>> Sure, so, I like to be very organized
when I put together my central line kit.

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,610
I have my disinfecting swab, then my
sterile dressing, and

163
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,105
I always have my ultrasound probe cover in
addition to the sterile ultrasound jab.

164
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,500
You'll have an assistant to put those
together when you're,

165
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,990
when you're doing your essential line,
it's very important.

166
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,590
Then, I set everything up in my kit.

167
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,430
I have the catheter here, which is your
Triple Lumin Catheter.

168
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,580
Now, it will come with these attached.

169
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,550
What I do is I take them off, and I put
these blue claves on.

170
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,410
As you see on the blue and the white part.

171
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,040
The brown port I leave open so that the
wire can go through,

172
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,820
and I always have a third clave ready for
when I have the line inside.

173
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,830
>> Now, tell me, Carly, why do you do
that?

174
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,700
>> It helps with our sterile technique.

175
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,200
The claves are they prevent any blood from
coming back, but

176
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,400
they also allow you to use alcohol or some
other sort of disinfectant so

177
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,080
that the line stays clean, and the patient
doesn't get an infection.

178
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,260
The other things you'll find in you kit
are a syringe,

179
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,100
with a needle attached to it.

180
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,300
Some people prefer to use this syringe,
there's others in the kit,

181
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,920
whatever your preference and your
institution's preference is.

182
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,750
The blue syringe will have a hole in the
back here, so

183
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,710
that you have the option of placing the
wire through.

184
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,370
This is the wire, we put the wire in
through the syringe or

185
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,920
through the needle after you've placed the
central line.

186
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,950
It is mobile here.

187
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,180
As you saw in the video, the steps can be
quite complex,

188
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,220
so we'll reference you back to the New
England Journal video for the exact steps.

189
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,510
Other things that are contained in the kit
are the dilator here.

190
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,310
Which goes over the wire and, and can help
open up the skin for

191
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,690
placement of the, of the line.

192
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,410
This is also true of the scalpel, which is
quite sharp and

193
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,200
should always be covered and, and used
safely so that no one gets injured.

194
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,240
The other things that come in the kit are
a transducer probe,

195
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,800
which we don't use very often at our, our
institution.

196
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,450
You can check with your attendings and

197
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,080
other teachers at your institution to use
that.

198
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,140
You'll also have an 18-gauge needle as
well as some stables for

199
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,060
fixing any of your ultrasound covers or
anything you might need to.

200
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,040
There's also lidocaine and

201
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,260
a syringe if you ever need to put in a
central line while the patient is awake.

202
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,680
Things which al, also come in the kit are.

203
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,620
The needle, with a needle driver to secure
the line after it is in place, and

204
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,990
then we also have our sterile [UNKNOWN]
dressing, and a patch, which helps

205
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,170
again with sterility to, make sure that
the, the area that the line is placed.

206
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,070
Does not have any bacteria that can in, go
into the patient.

207
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,620
>> Okay Carly well we have another kit in
front of us.

208
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,380
It looks similar to the last one but a
little different.

209
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,770
Can you explain it to us?

210
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,220
>> Sure, it is similar but there's a few
things that we'd like to point out.

211
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,330
So first of all you'll recognize this
sterile dressing,

212
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,980
again this is a line that should always be
placed under sterile technique.

213
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,030
You'll also have this syringe and

214
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:38,240
the needle that you will use to place the
the central line, and other

215
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,070
things you'll recognize are the lidocaine
if you do it under sterile conditions.

216
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,810
However, there's some very different
items.

217
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,240
This is a large introducer catheter.

218
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,620
You'll notice it doesn't have the triple
lumens, like we have on the other one.

219
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,480
It has one large one and it's 9 French so
it's used more often for

220
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,650
transfusing large volumes.

221
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:03,100
It also is handy because you can place
what's called a pulmonary artery catheter.

222
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,370
We have one curled up here, it's quite
long, and this goes into the patient,

223
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,315
much like you saw in both the New England
Journal video,

224
00:14:10,315 --> 00:14:14,440
video as well as in our lecture we talked
about some of the indications and reasons.

225
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,070
Things that are different are, you'll have
a balloon on the end,

226
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,100
which actually is able to be pumped up,
with the,

227
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,870
a syringe that attaches especially here,
and has a little locking device.

228
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,920
So if you do blow the balloon up.

229
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,930
Then you can lock it in place, so that it
stays.

230
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,660
>> Oh Carly let me ask you a question.

231
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,320
>> Sure.
>> If you don't happen to have a 33,

232
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,960
3CC syringe can you stick a 20CC syringe
on that?

233
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,770
>> Absolutely not.

234
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,580
It's a good question, but no, it's really
important that you don't do something like

235
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,350
that and you use only the syringe that
comes with the kit or a small syringe.

236
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,580
Because you don't want to over fill the
balloon,

237
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,490
while it's in the pulmonary area because
you can actually rupture the artery.

238
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,840
>> Okay, well we don't want that.

239
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,710
>> We don't want that, absolutely not.

240
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,830
Other things that you'll notice in this
kit are, again, your scalpel,

241
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,970
which you use to help cut the skin, and
then you can insert the dilator.

242
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,190
Again, you'll notice that this is a larger
and longer dilator.

243
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,080
Which is necessary,

244
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,980
because as we mentioned before, this is a
much larger catheter that you'll place.

245
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,630
Other things that are different, and this
is something that I always forget.

246
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,470
You have to remember, make a note to
remember, to place this little

247
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,350
protective sheath onto your pulmonary
artery catheter, before you place it in

248
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,900
the patient, otherwise, you'll have to
take it out and start all over again.

249
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,420
Again, you'll notice that there's three
different ports here,

250
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,950
aside from the one that you use to blow up
a balloon, so

251
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,680
you can inject medications and infusions
like we do normally.

252
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,550
And that's basically it.

253
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,510
That's the big differences between this
one and the, and the central line.

254
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,100
>> And I see the wire there too.

255
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,160
>> You do have the wire here, and again,

256
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,430
at our institution, we actually on our
checklist, have a note.

257
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,670
That we make to remove all of the wires
and all of the dilators, so

258
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,030
that we all verbally confirm with
ourselves and the nurses and the surgeons.

259
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,190
That all of those have been removed from
the patient so

260
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,780
that we don't have any of them left
inside.

261
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,400
>> Wonderful.

262
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,530
Well I thought it was really helpful to
look at those kits, because it's always

263
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,930
great to get a sense of the equipment that
you're going to be working with, and I

264
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:15,370
encourage you out there watching, to take
a look at your own institution's kits.

265
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,130
They may be the same, they may be slightly
different, but

266
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,960
it's great to have a look at the equipment
that you'll be using.

267
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,380
So you're familiar with what you're
going to be

268
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,180
working with when you start doing these
procedures.

269
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,035
Now to recap what we learned in this
segment,

270
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:32,380
the first thing is that we really tried,

271
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:38,508
we really understood the indications for
when we want to use monitors and lines.

272
00:16:38,508 --> 00:16:42,550
For instance an arterial catheterization
is useful when you want beat to

273
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:46,210
beat monitoring of hemodynamics, and you
may consider into,

274
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:52,600
central venous lines when you want to
infuse medications or

275
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,260
also, consider lines when you want to get
frequent blood draws.

276
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,700
We also talked about the importance.

277
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,670
Of having help, when you place a line.

278
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,300
Someone to monitor the well being, the
vital signs,

279
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,230
the human dynamics of the patient,

280
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:13,210
while your attention is focused on the
procedure and the task of placing lines.

281
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:18,250
Of course also consider using check lists
and

282
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,870
also keep in mind the importance of
sterilities.

283
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:28,580
Because avoiding line infections is really
our responsibility as practitioners,

284
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,760
physicians who are placing these lines, to
avoid iatrogenic complications and

285
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,640
injuries toward patents.

286
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,410
Your institution may have checklists,

287
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:42,330
to help ensure that these safety measures
are followed, and I encourage you to look.

288
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,610
Into your own institution's policies and

289
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,350
checklists to make sure that as you're
learning these techniques, that you're

290
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,190
doing them in the right way and following
the expectations of your institution.

291
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,339
So, we hope you learned a lot on this
episode, and we'll see you soon.

292
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:58,241
Thanks so much.

293
00:17:58,241 --> 00:17:59,975
>> Bye.

294
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:09,975
