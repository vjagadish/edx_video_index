1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,000
All right.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,360
Now this is Part 2 of the V(D)J
Recombination Story and

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,300
Part 2 is the Mechanism of the V(D)J
Recombination.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,060
What happens in V(D)J Recombination is ,.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,820
There is going to be recombine, recombine,
recombination to bring a D segment next to

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,380
a J segment, and a V next to a DJ segment;
so we're going to show that.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,380
And of course all these segments, there
are many other D segments and

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,290
many J segments, and many other V
segments.

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,710
We're just going to, talk about the chosen
ones and,

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,530
use hatch marks here to indicate that
there are some indetermined amount of

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,120
space between these segments that I've
drawn,.

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,640
There are two kinds of recombination
signal sequences which are donated in blue

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,450
here and red.

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:51,200
And each of those recombination signal
sequences is really DNA

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,920
sequence denoted by a triangle.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,260
So in the red, let's say, that really
stands for the following type of sequence.

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,210
That.
[BLANK_AUDIO]

18
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,660
There are two conserve sequences.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,600
Represented by, the red.

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,410
And one is a 7mer.

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,430
[BLANK_AUDIO]

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,930
A 7 nucleotide, 7 base pair sequence, and
one is a 9 nucleotide sequence.

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,560
And they're separated by a spacer.

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,060
And in the reds, for example, that spacer
could be 12 nucleotides.

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,580
All right?

26
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,490
12 nucleotide spacer.

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,850
And then, the blue segment is exactly like
the red segment with one exception.

28
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,716
It also has a 7mer and a 9mer or nonimer
or

29
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:54,660
[UNKNOWN]
and nonimer separated.

30
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,720
By a spacer, but that spacer is different.

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,770
That spacer is, 23-base pairs alone.

32
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,040
So, I'll put a 23 there.

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:10,600
So, this thing, these things are called
recombination signal sequence dash 23.

34
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,280
And, recombination.

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,550
Signal sequence, dash 12, to indicate the
difference, is only in the spacers.

36
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:27,820
And a VDJ recombination always occurs,
between a, a RSS23 and an RSS12.

37
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,750
So that's the 12/23 rule.

38
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,270
The reason for that rule, is that the
first.

39
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,537
The first mobile element to hop in, to the
[UNKNOWN] genome.

40
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:46,350
I'm going to show you that say, say this
was, this was the original mobile element.

41
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,760
And remember, the mobile element hopped
in, and any mobile element hopped in,

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,590
can also hop out.

43
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,630
And so, this particular mo, mobile element
hops out.

44
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,270
And it came in with one, RSS-12 and one
RSS-23.

45
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,050
And it hops out in the same way.

46
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,230
It excises itself because, rag 1 and rag 2
for example, in code

47
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,660
in integrates that's also, a disintegrates
that allows it to hop out.

48
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,120
So.

49
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,318
Let me erase this bracket just to show you
that when, when this thing hops out Rag 1

50
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:31,090
and Rag 2 will do a cleavage at two
points.

51
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,040
All right, and that cleavage at the two
points.

52
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,690
Leads to four different ends from two
different double strand

53
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,770
cuffs, and those four ends now have to be
rejoined.

54
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:48,350
Let me sort of show a blow up of one of
those two, of those cuts.

55
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,740
So here's a blow up of the cut.

56
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,700
It's going to be a little bit.

57
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:01,260
Alright and I'm just going to separate the
DNA there to show the cut.

58
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,115
Okay there's the cut there and there is
going to be a cut here.

59
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:16,030
[SOUND]
And the cut is going to be there.

60
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:23,180
And now, I'm going to draw for you, the
new cut over here.

61
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,400
So there is a cut at these two locations,
that, that occurred with the cleavage.

62
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,800
And now we've got ends,.

63
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,895
That are free,.

64
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:36,590
Four different ends that have been created
by the cleavage event.

65
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:42,080
And what happens now, is, that the non
homologous and joining proteins.

66
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,530
I'll, I'll draw an arrow here for you.

67
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,010
The non homologous and joining proteins
will take these ends.

68
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,610
And join them in a way that it recombines
the genome.

69
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:02,620
And, and the reason, and they're going to
only join them in a particular order.

70
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,810
They're going to take the J segment and
the D segment and join them.

71
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,340
And the two recombination signal sequence
ends and join them.

72
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,945
And the reason it's going to do it that
way is because.

73
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:20,950
Rag 1 and Rag 2 after making the cleavage
end up bound to the recombination signal

74
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,430
sequences to prevent the joining of the
two ends for a little bit,

75
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,530
to delay the joining so that the only two
ends that can be joined are D to J.

76
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:35,030
So as a result of the joining event, you
get the following.

77
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:47,010
You get the D segment joined to the J
segment, okay?

78
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:51,020
And then of course, the DNA extends out
here and the DNA extends out here.

79
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,080
And, the rest of the genome is upstream.

80
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,670
Just put that in there.

81
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:11,325
And here's the upstream v region,

82
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:14,019
ready for recombination.

83
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:15,390
And.

84
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:21,330
At the same time this, this, the DNA
that's been excised from the genome,

85
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,400
containing the two recombination signal
sequences now becomes available for

86
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,620
joining, and the two ends there are joined
in the following way so

87
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,682
that the blue segment and the red segment.

88
00:06:34,682 --> 00:06:36,619
Get joined.

89
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:42,645
So that, you get junction, like this.

90
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:44,578
[SOUND]

91
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:48,019
[BLANK_AUDIO]

92
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:51,200
[SOUND] So the excision, comes out as a
circle.

93
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,360
and.

94
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,790
In the absence of nonhomogsenjoining of
course,

95
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,340
the excision looks like excision of a
mobile element but

96
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,590
because nonhomogsenjoining is out there,
cleaning up the end.

97
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:10,070
It'll just take the excised segment and
join the two ends.

98
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,700
So you have two pieces of DNA.

99
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,320
You have the intact chromosome.

100
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:22,590
Which I'll designate here.

101
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:30,070
And you have a circle and the chromosome
is now the immunoglobulin, heavy chain.

102
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,790
After D to J joining has occurred, and

103
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,580
what happens next of course is V to D J
joining.

104
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,300
And you just go through the whole thing
all over again.

105
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,130
So that is a quick overview of the
mechanism of V D J recombination.

106
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,630
Thank you.
