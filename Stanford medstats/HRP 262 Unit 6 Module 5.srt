00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:05,887
[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:08,969
In this next module, I'm going to give you
several different strategies, for

3
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:10,430
plotting repeated measures data.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,150
So, it's always important to plot your
data, but

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,920
it becomes even more important when we're
dealing with repeated measures.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,770
Because there's an additional layer of
complexity to the data, and

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,020
sometimes when you just throw things into
the black box of regression, it's hard to,

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,680
get the right answer, but if you look at
the picture,

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,100
you're always going to get the right
answers.

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,650
So, it's really, it's really important to
plot.

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,620
The data that I'm going to use as an
example for

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,910
this module is the same runner's data.

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,060
I've got longitudinal data on, bone
density in women runners, and

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,130
women runners are at risk for having low
bone density.

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,780
So, we measure their bone density at
baseline, about a year later and

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,220
about two years later.

17
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,280
And for the purposes of this module, just
have some groups to compare.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,170
I'm going to compare three groups.

19
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,340
So, there was a subset of women.

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,300
Who, had irregular periods at, baseline
and

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,510
that puts you at risk of having low bone
density, and

22
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,540
some of those women went on to a
spontaneously regain their periods.

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,970
Some of the women went on to take oral
contraceptives to get their periods back,

24
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,250
and other women still had, irregular
periods at the end of the study and

25
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:19,710
we can compare, the trajectory of changes
in bone density in those three groups, so

26
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,160
the first type of plot I'm going to talk
about is, what we call a mean plot or

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,660
a profile plot, and I already showed you
several examples of these.

28
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,570
When I, showed you the examples of
repeated measures from

29
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,650
the medical literature.

30
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,910
This is typically the way people will
plot, repeated measures data.

31
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,410
Now, the key is that we, are going to
assume,

32
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,370
that there are some regular follow-up
times so that, everybody in

33
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,840
our study comes back kind of at the same
time for their follow-up measurements.

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,250
We're going to set esssence treating time
as discrete.

35
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,820
At each of those, regular follow-up times.

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,910
We're going to calculate the mean value of
the outcome for, everybody or

37
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,110
you know, broken down by different groups
for

38
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,250
different groups, and we're just going to
plot those means against time so,

39
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,222
here's you know the mean for one group at
time one, and a time two and a time three.

40
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:10,270
We're going to connect those means, with
some lines and

41
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,725
typically we'll also add like some like
standard deviation or standard error bars.

42
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:16,270
[SOUND].

43
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,950
Now, one of the key things that you have
to keep in mind when doing these

44
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,570
mean plots is that, often with follow up
data.

45
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,680
With longitudinal data, our sample size
sort of shrinks over time.

46
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,390
So, maybe the first, at the first
follow-up time.

47
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,640
That baseline there's 105 people in our
study.

48
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,120
But then, by the second measurement
[INAUDIBLE] the first follow-up time.

49
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,400
Maybe we're down to 105.

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,870
And then, maybe by the third measurement
we're down to like 90, and

51
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,240
it keeps shrinking from there.

52
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,600
So, as you lose people over time, you're
essentially changing the groups, so

53
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,870
it's going to be very important that you
impute missing values,

54
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,170
because we don't want to compare our, one
group of people at time one bear mean,

55
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,160
to a totally different group of people at
time two.

56
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,240
The 20 people that we lose between,
between the first time and

57
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,720
the second time, might be the 20 who have
the highest values.

58
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,230
And so, it might look like we're having a
decrease in the outcome simply because of,

59
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,250
who we lost.

60
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,870
So, we want to be comparing apples to
apples, so

61
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,870
we need to make sure, that our ends remain
constant.

62
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,280
And the way that you can do that is by
imputing missing values.

63
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,830
A simple way to impute,

64
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,540
the missing values is something called
last observation carried forward.

65
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,710
That's what I've done for the plots I'm
going to show you on the next page.

66
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,220
What that does is, if a woman is missing a
follow-up value,

67
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,230
you take the last value that you saw on
her.

68
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,750
And you, carry it forward.

69
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,110
So, you fill in her value at say time two,
with her value from time one.

70
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,900
What that does is if, if a person if you
know, for

71
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,250
the example of bone density if a woman
happens to have really high bone density.

72
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,510
And she drops out, you're at least
carrying forward her high value, so

73
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,360
that there isn't an artificial drop in the
mean, at time two,

74
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,580
just due to the fact that we've lost her.

75
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,690
So, that's going to be important to keep
in mind.

76
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,350
There's kind of two ways you can do these
plots.

77
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,220
You can plot the, absolute value in the
outcome variable.

78
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,820
The, the absolute mean.

79
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:05,380
Value or, the mean percent change since
baseline I'll show you both of those, so

80
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,120
now, I'm just showing you the plots two
different ways of plotting, the outcome

81
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,090
here is spine bone density and again I'm
looking at these three groups of women

82
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,640
runners in my study, I'm going to start
with the graph on the left hand side.

83
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,490
This is plotting the mean, percent change
from baseline.

84
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,820
So, what you'll notice is that, everybody
starts at 0 because at baseline your

85
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,690
mean percent change, your percent change
since baseline, at baseline is 0.

86
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,270
So, everybody starts at 0.

87
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,110
And then, we're going to calculate for

88
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,730
every person in my data set, their percent
change, from baseline to Year 1.

89
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,410
So, imagine that I've got a woman,

90
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,320
who has a spine bone density at baseline
of 1.0 [SOUND] and then,

91
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,070
at one year into the study, [SOUND]
she has a value of 1.03.

92
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,940
And then let's say, at two years into the
study, she has a value of, 1.05.

93
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,849
So, her percent changes.

94
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,180
Are going to be, well 0 at baseline.

95
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,820
And then, 3% at Year 1.

96
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,650
She went up, 3% from baseline to Year 1.

97
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,860
And then, 5% at Year 2.

98
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,730
From baseline to Year 2 she went up 5%.

99
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,280
We're going to calculate these percent
change values for Year 1 and for

100
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,680
Year 2 for every person in the data set.

101
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,200
And then, we'll calculate the average for
each group.

102
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,570
So, for example, this blue group here,

103
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,690
these are the women, who had irregular
periods throughout this study.

104
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,620
You can see that on average, they went
down about .5% from baseline to Year 1.

105
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,370
And they were basically stable.

106
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,120
They didn't change much by the end of the
study.

107
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,270
By Year 2 is about, a 0% change.

108
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,250
In contrast, the red group which were
those who,

109
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,440
spontaneously regained their periods, and
the black group, which were those who

110
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,760
started taking oral contraceptives, and
got their periods back that way.

111
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,614
They went up about 1% in the first year of
the study and about, you know,

112
00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:51,980
2+ percent in the second year of the
study.

113
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,720
So, that's the graph on the left hand
side.

114
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,180
The graph on the right hand side is very
similar except rather than, plotting these

115
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,550
percent changes in space line we're just
going to, plot the actual absolute values.

116
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,060
So, you can see that, spine bone density
is measured in grams per

117
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,548
centimeters squared and a typical value is
1.0.

118
00:06:07,548 --> 00:06:10,550
These women were all a little low to begin
with because of

119
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,340
the fact that they were having irregular
periods at baseline.

120
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,940
So, they're a little below 1.

121
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,000
But, what's interesting is you can see
that the blue group,

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,050
they were even kind of a riskier group,

123
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,630
because they started with a lower,
baseline value than the other two groups.

124
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,310
So, that's something that the, the
baseline differences don't show up on

125
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,370
the percent change graph, that you do see
them on the absolute value graph.

126
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,470
And then, we're just going to calculate
the,

127
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,270
mean value of spine bone density for each
of those groups of baseline.

128
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,340
We do those mean values at Year 1 and at
Year two.

129
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,170
And again, connect them with some dots.

130
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,100
And, you can see that the base, the same
basic, general pattern emerges from

131
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,520
this plot, but you get the additional
information, on the opposite plot of

132
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,990
whether or not there were any, baseline
differences, as you can see here.

133
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,560
And, the other thing, as you can see,

134
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,970
that the percent change graph, well, it's
maybe a little bit.

135
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:58,610
Prettier.

136
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,810
Those tend to be a little bit neater.

137
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,760
It may be a little bit easier to
interpret.

138
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,220
So, depending on, the problem,

139
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,840
depending on what you're trying to show,
one of these graphs might be preferable.

140
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,570
But those are both, they're, they're
going to give you basically the same,

141
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,290
general pattern.

142
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,320
I also went ahead, and did the same plots
for

143
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,100
plots for whole body bone mineral content,

144
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,540
which is just the total amount of calcium
in your skeleton, just as another example.

145
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,320
You can see again, same, same general
idea.

146
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,750
There's the group, group in blue is kind
of going down over time.

147
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,810
The other two groups are going up over
time.

148
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,900
One is displayed as the percent change
since baseline,

149
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,370
which gives you a little bit more you
know, you can, the x axis, or

150
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,830
the y axis can be stretched out a little
bit more so you can.

151
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,780
You know, it gives you a little more
distinction.

152
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,960
But the absolute values,

153
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,480
actually tell you what the absolute values
were on the right-hand side.

154
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
So, those are the mean plots.

155
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,340
A second type of plot you can do is
actually,

156
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,680
rather than calculating the averages at
the discrete time points,

157
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,790
which assumes that everybody was measured
at the same follow-up time points,.

158
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,850
Another option is that,

159
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,020
there is a way to do the graph, where you
can treat time as continuous.

160
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,340
And this is important if you've got data,
where not everybody was measured,

161
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,710
at the same follow-up time points,

162
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,189
especially if there's a lot of variability
in those follow-up times.

163
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,310
When you do this graph, it's important
that, you have to have some way to

164
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,550
account for the fact that it's the same
person over time.

165
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,620
So, we're really only going to be able to
do the percent change since baseline,

166
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,280
that's the only way to.

167
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,100
Account for the correlation over time.

168
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,730
You're not going to be able to do the
absolute value graph, in this one,

169
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,890
because that won't account for, the fact
that it's the same person over time.

170
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,270
We're going to plot each subject's percent
change since baseline,

171
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,010
against their actual follow-up time,
whatever that follow-up time is.

172
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,350
We're not going to be calculating any
means here.

173
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,760
We're just going to be doing a scatter
plot,

174
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,670
of the percent change since baseline
against the follow-up time.

175
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,910
Then we'll superimpose a smoothing line
for

176
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,020
each of the different groups to figure out
what the patterns are over time.

177
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,450
Notice that, we're not calculating any
means here.

178
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,100
So, we don't have to impute the missing
values.

179
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,210
If a, person doesn't come back for their
follow up value, you know,

180
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,060
maybe they're only going to contribute
only one or

181
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,630
two dots, to the follow up to the scatter
plot.

182
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,720
So, maybe here's a woman who comes back,
the first time, but maybe she doesn't come

183
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,590
back at Year 1 like she was supposed to,
but she comes back at Year 2.

184
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,160
We can still, fit the smoothing line to
those data.

185
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,400
We don't have to do anything about.

186
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,430
Filling in, the values that are missing.

187
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,420
A person contributes, just when they were
measured.

188
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,180
Let me just show you some examples.

189
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,020
This will become clearer with an actual
example.

190
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,270
So, what I've done here is on the same,
same data as before,

191
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,660
the outcome here is this spine bone
density, it's the,

192
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,050
I've done the percent change since
baseline in, spine bone density.

193
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,600
Again you need to do percent change here.

194
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,620
And, I'm plotting that against the years,
since the baseline DXA.

195
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,620
Now, you can see that time is continuous,
there's some variability in

196
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,650
when women actually came back, for these
follow up measurements.

197
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,780
Women were asked to come back at one year,
and then at two years.

198
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,880
But here's what actually happened.

199
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,589
So, here's one year.

200
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,260
You can see that, women did come back, by
and large right around one year.

201
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,510
But there's some variability.

202
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,160
Not everybody came back right at one year,

203
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,830
some people were a little late, in coming
back.

204
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,830
If you go to two years, there's even more,
variability, right.

205
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,140
Women were supposed to come back at two
years.

206
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,730
But there's a huge amount of variability
in.

207
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,140
When people actually, came for those
measurements, the end of a study you know

208
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,300
people get busy, we had to chase people
down a little bit to get them in, and

209
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,495
sometimes took longer than, the two years
that it was supposed to take [SOUND].

210
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:25,300
[COUGH] Let me just tell you, what, you
know, is actually being plotted here so

211
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,180
let me give you an example, so this person
right here this little dot right here,

212
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,770
what is this represent so this is saying
that this.

213
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,650
This person had, was measured, they came
back for

214
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,620
their one year follow-up visit right about
one year, just a little after one year.

215
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,860
At that time point compared with baseline,
they had a, about a,

216
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,290
negative three and one half percent
decrease in their spine bone density.

217
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,920
I don't know, which other dot represents
that person, but

218
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,150
that's okay since, everything is.

219
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,890
Calculated as the percent change this
baseline sort of accounted, for

220
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,170
the within subject correlation.

221
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,330
Then I super imposed for each of the
different groups,

222
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,800
these smoothing lines to get the pattern
over time, and

223
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,115
you can see the general pattern that
emerges is very similar.

224
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:09,650
To the pattern, that we saw with the,
profile plots, with the mean plots.

225
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,190
However, there's a little more subtlety,
on where we treat time as continuous.

226
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,620
It's accounting for the, variation in
time, and

227
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,140
that can make, some difference in the
trajectory over time as you can see here,

228
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,923
especially with so much variation at Year
2.

229
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,313
You also, as I mentioned, [SOUND] do not
have to impute, the missing data for

230
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:33,150
this, left-hand graph because, if a person
didn't come back,

231
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,930
they just don't get a dot for Year 2 or
for Year 1 or around that time point.

232
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,250
Whenever they come back they get a dot,
and that's it.

233
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,460
And you see the general pattern is, the
same.

234
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,170
There's certain advantages again of the,
left hand plot here.

235
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,360
I went ahead did the same plot with whole
body bone mineral content.

236
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,110
Again, you can see that the general
pattern that emerges is very similar to

237
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,680
what we saw, for the mean plots.

238
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,350
You get a little bit more going on at the
end here, so, you know,

239
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,190
we were definitely decreasing, in the blue
group.

240
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,210
You know, with the, full body bone mineral
content.

241
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,690
And that pattern is borne out to about two
years.

242
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,690
And then, you can see though, there's a
few people who came back after that, and

243
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,680
that drags the, this line a little bit up.

244
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,220
So, you get slightly different patterns.

245
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,010
But generally it looks.

246
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,670
Pretty similar, but this can make a
difference, depending on the data set that

247
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,110
you have, if you have a lot of variation
in follow up times.

248
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,405
[SOUND] So, those are just a couple of
different ways,

249
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:25,300
that you can plot repeated measures data.

250
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,429
