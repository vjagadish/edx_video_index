1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,932
In the last module, I told you how to fit
the baseline hazard function, for

2
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:13,360
Y [INAUDIBLE] and exponential models,
essentially only fitting the intercept.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,149
In this module, we're also going to
incorporate predictors.

4
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,000
So just to remind you that what we're
modeling in these parametric regression

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,360
models is the log of the hazard rate for
exponential models fortunately it's

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,200
easy because we just have a constant
hazard rate it doesn't change over time.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,570
So we estimate the baseline hazard rate
for

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,500
our reference group with an intercept, and
that's it.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,820
We could then incorporate additional risk
factors.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,520
So we can put in, as we normally do with
regression,

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,180
a set linear combination of datas and
predictors.

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,520
And that would increase or decrease the
hazard rate.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,370
So say you have smokers perhaps the beta
for smoking would be positive, and

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,770
your hazard rate would go up because you
were a smoker.

15
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,820
So we can incorporate these additional
risk factors.

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,850
Just to remind you, for the Weibull model,
we had to estimate not only.

17
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,520
The hazard function at time equals zero,
which is what the intercept here,

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,260
alpha, represents, but also an additional
parameter that tells us how much or how

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,870
how much the hazard function is increasing
or decreasing as a function of time.

20
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,160
So, one additional parameter.

21
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,970
And, but again we can add some, some
predictors and

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,720
risk factors to that so that hazard rates
for different groups will be different.

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,830
So just to give and

24
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:35,748
example, I have some data on patients with
HIV early in the epidemic.

25
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:40,470
the're, the're were many potential risk
factors that could explain why people

26
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,120
survived or lived, survived or died
faster, than one another.

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,190
But I just fit some data, just to have an
example to fit the model.

28
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,270
I, I fit an exponential model, so we're
modeling, again, the log hazard rate and

29
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,070
I put one predictor in the model, which is
age.

30
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,490
So this is a continuous predictor.

31
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,600
And of course, regression can incorporate
continuous predictors, but

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,890
we can compare people at different age
groups.

33
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,140
So here's that the final model came out of
I've already fixed the negative so

34
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,670
the signs are correct.

35
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,390
So we can figure out the hazard rate by
just exponentiating and then we'd,

36
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,650
of course, have to plug in different ages.

37
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,270
So if I wanted to say, well what is the
hazard rate for

38
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,860
somebody who is 30 years old, for example,
I would plug in 30 for age?

39
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,220
I would solve this equation and it would
give me the hazard rate for a 30-year old.

40
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,810
The hazard rate for a 30-year old is
constant, but

41
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,280
it's different from the hazard rate for,
say a 40-year old.

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,670
And that's illustrated on this next slide.

43
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,640
I went ahead and plotted hazard rates for
different age groups.

44
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,840
So in red here this was age equals 20.

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,790
Blue was age equals 30.

46
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,685
So again, if you plug into that equation
for

47
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:58,650
the hazard function [INAUDIBLE] raised to
-5.859 plus .0939 times age.

48
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,340
You can see that the hazard functions, the
hazard rates don't go

49
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,100
up linearly with age, because remember,
we're running an exponential.

50
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,570
So as you go up in age, you know, here's
40, here's 50 year olds, and

51
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,550
here's 60 year olds.

52
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,730
You can see that there's a big jump in the
mortality rate as you jump up in age.

53
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,060
But that's all we've modeled, by the
exponential model that tells us as you

54
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,300
go up in age, you're rate of death goes
up.

55
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,500
We can then plot the corresponding
survival curves,

56
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,130
once you know the hazard rate, you know,

57
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,790
and you know you're on the exponential,
then you know the survival curve.

58
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,560
So here's the corresponding survival
curve.

59
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,065
Here's the 20 year olds, they're doing the
best.

60
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:33,790
[LAUGH] They're not dying as fast and

61
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,090
here is the 60 year olds, they're dying
much more quickly.

62
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,890
Actually it's a very, very steep drop in
survival for them.

63
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,180
So this is just illustrating that survival
depends on age and

64
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,720
now I have a model that predicts that.

65
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,710
The beta for age tells me that the older I
am the worse I am doing for,

66
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,560
at least for this data set.

67
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,090
We can take the betas from either a
Weibull or an exponential model, and

68
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,640
we can exponentiate them to get hazard
ratios, and

69
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,550
a hazard ratio is just a measure of
relative risk.

70
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,410
It's a ratio of two hazard rates.

71
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,280
So we can compare different groups.

72
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,680
Or if we have a continuous predictor, as
we do here.

73
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,910
We can say, what's the hazard ratio for

74
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,980
a 1 unit increase in the continuous
predictor.

75
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,810
And just to show you how that works here.

76
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,160
Again, this, and the numerator, is the
hazard rate for

77
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,230
a person who is one year older than the
person in the denominator.

78
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,500
So I, my model says this is hazard rate
for somebody's who's 51.

79
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,850
And this, and the denominator is the
hazard rate for

80
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,220
somebody's who's 50, for example.

81
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,548
And it doesn't matter, what exact ages I
plug in.

82
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:37,470
But I'm going to put one unit higher in
the numerator so that I can get

83
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,590
the hazard range, the hazard ratio for a
one unit higher age when an older age.

84
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,200
So, here's the hazard rate for a 51 year
old.

85
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,420
Here's the hazard rate for a 50 year old.

86
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,450
Well, they have the same baseline hazard
rates.

87
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,490
So those are going to cancel.

88
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,060
And they have only a difference of 1 in
age, so everything's going to cancel

89
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,930
except the e raised to [SOUND] one so,
we're going to cancel out this.

90
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,350
And essentially we're down, we end up with
0.0939, the beta for age exponentiated.

91
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,700
When you exponentiate that you get a
hazard ratio of 1.098.

92
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,640
So this would tell you that for every one
year older in age you were,

93
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,410
there was a 10% increase, or almost a 10%
increase in the mortality rate.

94
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,940
That's a big jump because a one year
increase in age is not a lot.

95
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,850
So we can get relative risks out of these
models.

96
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,920
These, particular models the Weibull and
the exponential, when we assume a Weibull

97
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,560
and an exponential distribution, they are
what we call proportional hazards models.

98
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,430
That means they're models from which we
can get hazard ratios.

99
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,150
We're assuming those hazards are might be
proportional and so

100
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,000
that we could calculate hazard ratios.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,420
There are other types of parametric
models,

102
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,520
like if you assumed a log normal
distribution that you can't get

103
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,430
hazard ratios out of, but from these two
you can get hazard ratios.

104
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,870
And I just want to point out, that if
you're working in SAS.

105
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,810
The way that SAS calculates things when it
gives you out the beta for an exponential

106
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,430
model to get a hazard ratio you first have
to negate the data and the exponential it.

107
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,410
I had already fixed that on the my output
when I presented the model for

108
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,750
the age and HIV data.

109
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,940
For the Weibull Model you have to take the
output from SAS.

110
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,840
The beta and gate it and then divide by
the scale parameter,

111
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,370
which we talked about what that scale
parameter is.

112
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,910
So the hazard ratio calculation takes a
few steps, so

113
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,720
just we'll practice doing that.

114
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,090
Now I want to show you an example where
we're just comparing two groups.

115
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,390
So remember that we had this hepatitis
trial last week,

116
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:39,080
where 22 people with chronic active
hepatitis were treated with a steroid and

117
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,060
22 were just in the control group, not
treated with anything.

118
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,360
And using data from the trial, I fit
exponential and Weibull models.

119
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,550
Just to remember you, remind you what it
looked like, here's the Kaplan Meier

120
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,420
curves from that data, this indeed had a
certain significant log rate to

121
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,340
test because you can see that the treated
group did a lot better than the control.

122
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,860
The control group is here in red, the
treated group is in black.

123
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,990
So you really wanted to be treated in this
study.

124
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,650
We can take the Kaplan-Meier curves.

125
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,580
And, plot the negative log of the
survival.

126
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,350
The cumulative hazard plots.

127
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:14,150
So, remember, that, if I plot the negative
log on the Kaplan Meiers curves, yes,

128
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,870
I end up with something that is a straight
line.

129
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,150
That would indicate that my hazard
function is constant over time.

130
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,400
I don't have a perfectly straight line
here so here's the control group.

131
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,400
It's not bad as far as real data go but
it's definitely a little bit curvy.

132
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,160
And the steroid group is even a little bit
more curved.

133
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,350
It's a little bit curved upward which
would,

134
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:37,570
curved upward would indicate somewhat of a
hazard, increasing over time.

135
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,970
So it's not a perfectly straight line.

136
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,740
Of course real data is never going to be
perfectly straight.

137
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,170
So we'll have to kind of choose carefully
between the exponential and

138
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,150
the viable functions here.

139
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,600
So when you get data, before fitting these
parametric regression laws.

140
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,930
You're going to want to plot this
cumulative hazard function again,

141
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,700
most computers will do it for you, very
easily.

142
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,060
Because we want to compare groups, and we
want to calculate hazard rations.

143
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,370
We also need to do one of these log, log
plots.

144
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,230
And again, all this is, is you take your
Kaplan-Meier estimates.

145
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,260
You take negative log of it, which is what
we just did for

146
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,200
the cumulative hazard plot, and then you
take another log.

147
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,720
And you don't have to do this by hand.

148
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,650
SASS will do this for you, or

149
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,820
whatever computer program you're, you're
in will do this for you pretty easily.

150
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,840
But the reason we want to do the log log
plots, is that,

151
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,240
if we're going to be calculating a hazard
ratio, a single hazard ratio.

152
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,460
The assumption behind that is that there
is one single hazard over time.

153
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,940
So we are assuming that whatever the
hazard function looks like over time.

154
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,510
It doesn't even have to be something very
smooth whatever it is, over time,

155
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,350
the distance between the hazard rate
curves between the two groups is

156
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,100
always the same because otherwise there
wouldn't be a single hazard ratio.

157
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,450
Imagine that, if I were to be able to plot
the hazard functions and I got something

158
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:59,060
that looked like [SOUND] this' here's
group one, and here's group two.

159
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,810
Well, at, you know, the beginning of the
study, the hazard ratio is 1.0,

160
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,740
there is no relative difference between
the two groups The end of the study,

161
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,520
the hazard ratio might be three.

162
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,770
So, there's not a single hazard ratio if
the hazard rates aren't

163
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,800
parallel over time.

164
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,210
The log-log plot evaluates whether or not
the hazard rates are parallel over time.

165
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,460
Again, we can't easily directly draw the
hazard functions, so

166
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,340
we do these log-log plots.

167
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,060
If I'm looking at these log-log plots, I'm
hoping that the lines are parallel.

168
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,100
These are not perfectly parallel lines,
you can see here,.

169
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,450
But, as real data go, they're not
terrible.

170
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,620
I'm probably not going to make too much of
a fuss.

171
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,228
Over this particular log-log plot.

172
00:09:35,228 --> 00:09:39,590
We are going to talk a lot more about
log-log plots when we get to

173
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,420
Caulk's regression, so I will leave it at
that for now.

174
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,650
But for real data these are kind of
reasonably parallel, probably good enough.

175
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,350
So I took the data from those two groups,
and

176
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,679
I then fit in exponential regression
model.

177
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,410
So here is what I got from the results of
the out put from my computer.

178
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,820
So now I have as an exponential so I have
one constant intercept.

179
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,090
So this would represent, this intercept
would represent the hazard rate for

180
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,650
the control group.

181
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:12,160
We also get a beta for treatment and that
would represent the increase or

182
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,110
decrease in the hazard rate for the
treated group.

183
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,640
And this is a nice binary predictor here,
so it, you either have it or you don't.

184
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,670
Now, as I mentioned before, you have to be
a little careful because if you wanted to

185
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,035
get the hazard rate for the treated group.

186
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:26,740
[BLANK_AUDIO]

187
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:33,180
If I wanted to calculate that directly the
hazard rate for the treated group here.

188
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,860
I would have to do remember we're
going to,

189
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,300
the model is the log of the hazard rate is
equal to alpha plus beta here.

190
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,620
So we have to exponentiate it but

191
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,360
you not only have to exponentiate you
actually have to change the signs for

192
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,936
alpha and beta so this is going to be
exponentiate 4.4886 minus

193
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:56,410
.89008 That would give me the hazard rate
for the treated group.

194
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,960
The hazard rate for the control group
would be equal to E raised to

195
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,750
negative 4.4886, there's, and they don't,
they get nothing.

196
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,110
The beta is multiplied by zero there.

197
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,850
Treated as quoted as one in control of
zero here.

198
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,535
They're going to have a higher hazard
rate,

199
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:13,870
the treated group is going to have a lower
hazard rate.

200
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,310
I can then divide those two hazard rates
to get the hazard ratio or

201
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,980
I could just take the beta for the
treatment, negate it,

202
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,143
as I mentioned before, you have to negate
it, exponentiate it [SOUND] and

203
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:32,630
when you do that, you will come up with
the hazard rat, ratio.

204
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,495
So if I do that, and I've already done
that out here, if I exponentiate negative

205
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:41,650
.9008, that's the treatment effect, I get
a hazard issue of .406.

206
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,560
And as we saw in the Kaplan–Meier curves,

207
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,990
being in the treatment group definitely
protected, reduced the mortality rate, and

208
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,740
that's what the hazard ratio is telling
us, there's about a 60% decrease in

209
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,550
the mortality rate in the treatment,
versus the control.

210
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,270
I'll just point again,

211
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,770
since we're doing likelihood estimation We
get a negative 2 log likelihood.

212
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,130
We also get these AIC criteria,

213
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,810
these information criteria, which I
mentioned in the last module.

214
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,360
Basically, smaller is better, and

215
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,570
you can use them to compare different
models in the same data.

216
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,530
We can use all of these to help us decide
whether or

217
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,630
not an exponential or a Weibull model is
better here.

218
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,900
Oh, I should point out that the treatment
effect the beta does turn out to

219
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,660
be statistically significant.

220
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,450
The p value here is very similar to the p
value we got from the log ranked test

221
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,309
thing, that treatment does significantly
increase mortality.

222
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,720
So then a I sent a Weibull model to these
same data.

223
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,930
So here's the Weibull model fit.

224
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:36,870
So the estimate,

225
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,270
the intercept is very similar the treated
value is pretty similar,

226
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:46,470
it's just a little bit higher and then we
additionally estimate the scale parameter.

227
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,052
It comes up to be 1.26 here.

228
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:49,250
And ab,

229
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,140
since it's above one that would indicate
that the hazard is increasing over time.

230
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,180
And, we saw that in the, cumulative hazard
class.

231
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,990
Those curves were a little bit curved
upward.

232
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,870
Indicating a little bit of increase, in
the hazard, over time.

233
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,590
Now, how do we decide whether or

234
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,940
not we want to stick decide to stick with
the, why the model here?

235
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,560
Or with the exponential model.

236
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,180
We have to kind of compare the two models.

237
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,560
So we can look at the negative two log
likelihoods and these AIC statistics.

238
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,650
So the negative two log likelihood, we've
done before.

239
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,660
If we want to compare two nested models,
and

240
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,990
these are, one has one additional
parameter, we could take the negative two

241
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,020
log likelihood from the exponential model
which is 136.069.

242
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,320
That's the smaller model.

243
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,380
We subtract the negative 2 log likelihood
from the bigger model.

244
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,160
That's roughly going to come out to be,
it's a little bit more than 2,

245
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,030
about 136 minus roughly 134, it's going to
be, just a little bit over 2.

246
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,200
This is going to have a chi square of one
degree of freedom because we have

247
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,250
estimated only one additional parameter,
with a Weibull model and we know that

248
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,950
a chi-square of one freedom 2 is not
going to be statistically significant.

249
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,220
We have to closer to 4 to get statistical
significance.

250
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,180
So that's not going to be a statistically
significant difference

251
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,930
that indicates that it's,

252
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,870
that we're probably not gaining too much
by estimating the additional parameter.

253
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,140
It doesn't seem to add significantly to
the model.

254
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,340
We can also get the AIC.

255
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,430
Now the AIC, the, the first one, which
doesn't have the additional penalty is,

256
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,320
and remember the difference between the -2
Log Likelihood and

257
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,340
the AIC is just two times the number of
parameters.

258
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,278
So we're estimated three parameters so

259
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:33,860
we're just going to add 6 to the -2 Log
likelihood.

260
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,820
So 132.89, becomes 139.898.

261
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,760
There's a penalty incorporated for the
number of parameters in the model.

262
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,670
The Weibull model, the just a plain AIC is
actually slightly smaller in

263
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,840
the Weibull model compared with the
exponential.

264
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,390
So that one I'm

265
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,600
going to actually argue that the Weibull
model is a little bit better.

266
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,080
But I prefer the AICC which has this
additional [UNKNOWN] for some samples.

267
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:02,140
That one is 140.36 in the exponential and
140.49 in the Weibull and

268
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,420
again, you're looking for smaller being
better so

269
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,620
that one would say that the exponential
was slightly better than the Weibull.

270
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,480
So you could make an argument either way
here, but I, I probably would default to

271
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,720
the simpler model in this case and just go
with the exponential.

272
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,790
Although, there is a little bit of,

273
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,810
the hazard rates seem to be changing a
little bit over time.

274
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,890
We can also then calculate the hazard
ratio.

275
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,050
So how to you calculate the hazard ratio
from a Weibull model?

276
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,660
So getting sash you first have to negate
the beta, and

277
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,170
you have to divide by the scale perimeter.

278
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,000
So I'm going to take the -1.05 divide by
the scale perimeter 1.267 and

279
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,410
then I'm going to exponentiate that.

280
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,310
That gives the me the hazard ratio for
treatment versus control, it comes out to

281
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,280
be .43, very similar to what we've got out
of the exponential model.

282
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,200
So you can see, it didn't make a heck of a
lot of difference,

283
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,770
which baseline underlying model we assumed
here, to how the ratios come out to be

284
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:57,080
reasonably similar, about a 60% decrease
in mortality, in the mortality rate.

285
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,480
And then I went ahead and plotted, again,

286
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,060
since we've completely estimated the
survival curve as a mathematical function,

287
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,630
we can plot these beautiful smooth curves.

288
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,890
So, I went ahead and plotted, this is the
Weibull model, for the two groups, and

289
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,910
this is the exponential model, for the two
groups.

290
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,770
And, visually, I can't see too, too much
difference between the two [UNKNOWN].

291
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,270
They're definitely a little bit different,
but you can see that it doesn't make,

292
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:24,000
the Weibull versus the exponential, didn't
make a huge difference here.

293
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,220
The, Kaplan-Meier curve, is at the bottom.

294
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,630
That's just our observed survival curve,
directly from what we see in our data.

295
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,660
And you can see that you know, are smooth,
parametric estimates, this is,

296
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,530
again, the non-parametric, just what we
see in our data.

297
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:41,290
This is the parametric models, and when we
plot that kind of as a smooth,

298
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,270
pretend we have a perfect mathematical
curve,

299
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,750
it looks like pretty close to what the
Kaplan-Meier curves look like.

300
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,940
You'll see that the only difference is
that the Kaplan-Meier curves do

301
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,540
have this funny thing of trying, sort of

302
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,850
coming together which would be due to
small numbers at the end of the course and

303
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,330
of course, our perfect mathematical curves
are never come together.

304
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,470
They are always going to be separate.

305
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,540
So it looks like an exponential or

306
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,670
viable as a reasonable fit of the, of the
data here.

307
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,390
I want to just show you one more thing
because next week we

308
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,190
are going to be moving to cox regression
and the difference between

309
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,550
the parametric regression models and the
cox regression model,

310
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:19,070
is that with parametric regression we are
only going to estimate the hazard ratios.

311
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:24,270
So if you kind of go back to the model, to
the [SOUND] equations here.

312
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,350
Go way, way back.

313
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,600
So here's like the equation for a Weibull
model.

314
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,460
What we're going to do is

315
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,330
we're not going to bother to estimate the
intercepts at all.

316
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,850
We're going to say, we're going to cancel
out the intercept.

317
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,660
And only estimate the betas.

318
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,340
Okay, so there's going to be no intercept
in the model.

319
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,180
We're not going to assume it fits any
particular function.

320
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,780
Any particular mathematical function and

321
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,483
we're just going to get the hazard ratios
out.

322
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,500
Sometimes that's all we care about, is
just comparing different groups.

323
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,280
So, I then took these data just to show
you to prepare you for

324
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,410
next week how, what happens when I run a
cox regression on these data.

325
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,860
I'm just going to get hazard ratio out, so
I went ahead and

326
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,170
fit these data in a cox regression model,
no intercept because we're

327
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:06,090
not making any assumptions about the
underlying baseline hazard function.

328
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,010
But we do get a beta for the treatment,
and that's the beta.

329
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,820
You can exponentiate this one directly to
get the hazard ratio, and since that knows

330
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,140
that your, or that your computer problem,
probably from is going to know that you

331
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,490
want the hazard ratio with cox regression
it does it automatically.

332
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,470
We do get a, this is a statistically
significant effect.

333
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,240
And a hazard ratio is 0.435.

334
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,940
So very similar to what I got out of the
exponential in the viable models

335
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,020
in the confidence interval of course this
not cross one since the p value

336
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,040
is significant.

337
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,240
So in terms of that hazard ratio, if
that's all I care about,

338
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,510
it didn't really matter too much if I fit
parametric regression or

339
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,140
cox regression but the cox regression will

340
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,160
not give me out a nice smooth mathematical
curve like the parametric regression will.

341
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,690
