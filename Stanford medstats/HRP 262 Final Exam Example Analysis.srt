2
00:00:05,531 --> 00:00:09,466
In this next module, I'm going to walk you
through a real data analysis experience,

3
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:13,900
to help you synthesize all of the things
that you've learned in this course.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,320
And, as the example data, I'm going to use
the data set from the final exam,

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,380
since you've all just had to grapple with
that data.

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,870
I've laid out a series of steps here that
I think you should take,

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,540
when you're doing a real data analysis.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,170
And these are really just guidelines, but

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,520
you'll see that the emphasis, is to make
sure, that you spend ample time

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,520
doing things like checking your data set,
understanding your variables,

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,940
thinking about missing data, exploring
simple relationships, graphing, graphing,

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,800
graphing and just really understanding
what you've got in your data.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,430
You really need to do all of that before
you jump to the model building.

14
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,620
So that's the emphasis of this list.

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,880
I also want to remind you, that we always
want to document all of our steps.

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,460
We're striving for a reproducible
research.

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,760
Which means that I could hand my code to
somebody else, and

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,390
they would be able to recreate the steps
that I used in my analysis, and

19
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,910
also reproduce the tables and figures in
my paper.

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,430
So now, I'm going to walk you through,
each of these steps in turn,

21
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,287
as applied to this example data set.

22
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,860
So, first thing we're going to do is
going to prep the data set, just make sure

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,740
we've got the variable names that we want
formatting the variables correctly,

24
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,670
importing the data set into SASS or
whatever statistical program that

25
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,260
you're using, making any new variables
that we need.

26
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,620
I asked the authors of this original
paper, this was a data set from a cluster,

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,760
randomized trial, and I this was a paper
that was published in BMJ open.

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,710
I asked the authors to send me the data.

29
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,098
They had indicated that the data were
available.

30
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:48,720
They sent it to me in the long format.

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,790
It was also sent to me with variable names
that were in Italian.

32
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,160
So first thing I went through and did, was
fortunately the data dictionary was in

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,520
English, so I was able to go through and
rename all of my variable names into

34
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,409
something in English to make it easier for
myself.

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,000
These data were collected as part of a
cluster randomized trial, so

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
there were six pregnancy clinics, three
were randomized to

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,090
be intervention clinics, three were
randomized to be control clinics.

38
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,560
They enrolled women from within each of
those clinics, a total of 89 women women

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,960
enrolled into the in, intervention clinics
received lifestyle counseling to

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,240
help them lose their pregnancy weight
faster after the birth of their babies.

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,490
And women in the control groups didn't get
anything.

42
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:39,100
And the primary outcome of that trial was
the mother's weight loss postpartum.

43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,610
However the authors went back, and they
did a secondary analysis.

44
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,350
These data set represent that secondary
analysis.

45
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:51,460
They were able to get data on the birth on
the weights of the babies up until

46
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,420
four years of age, on 64 of the original
89 infants from the original trial.

47
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,590
I went ahead and took this data set, and
also converted it into the broad form of

48
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,900
the data, so it was sent to me in the long
form, I used a proc transpose in SASS.

49
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,460
When you use proc transpose, you can
change one outcome variable,

50
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,170
one repeated measures outcome variable at
a time into the broad form, and

51
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,070
then you have to merge the data sets.

52
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,750
But I went ahead and did that, because
there are a few things, like, I want to

53
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,290
get correlation matrices where I'm
going to need the broad form of the data.

54
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,470
I also went through, and

55
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,610
there were a few binary variables that
were coded as 1,2 rather than 1, 0.

56
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,190
I prefer them as 1,0, so I recoded those.

57
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,160
But the data set was pretty clean.

58
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,980
There wasn't a huge amount to do in terms
of prep.

59
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,690
The next thing we're going to do, is we're
going to check the data set for

60
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,040
data errors and also if there are
outliers, extreme values, we want to

61
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,220
learn about those early, even if those are
not errors, if those are real values.

62
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,510
It turns out that, that, the these data
again were from a published paper, so

63
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,720
as you might expect or you would hope.

64
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,700
The data set when the author sent it to
me, was quite clean.

65
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,430
So you'll see that I didnt' have to spend
a lot of time on checking the data set

66
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,530
here, though I didn't find anything that
was worrisome,

67
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,626
it looked like a nice clean data set.

68
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:08,520
If you're dealing with your own real data,
it's probably not going to be this clean.

69
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,060
These have sort of been pre-cleaned for
us.

70
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,780
So I went ahead and

71
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,000
just got basic statistics, like the number
max and min, for all of the variables.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,800
I'm looking to see if there's anything
outside of the range that I would expect.

73
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,850
I'm looking to see how many babies have
these values.

74
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,250
For each of these variables.

75
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,240
Again, everything looks pretty clean,

76
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,100
I didn't find anything that looks
worrisome here.

77
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,860
There's a lot of variables here,

78
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,980
I'm using the broad form of the data to
generate these statistics.

79
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,990
So there's a lot of variables because I've
got the variable for

80
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,300
each one of the time points.

81
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,880
The babies were measured about ten times
in the first year of life they had

82
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,720
their weights and heights measured, and
they were measured also at their

83
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,940
second birthday, at the third birthday,
and at their fourth birthdays for

84
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:59,340
a total of about 13 weight length
measurements per baby.

85
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,120
What you can see is that the birth weight
is we, weight length z

86
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,280
one of the outcomes was to translate that
weight into a z score that adjusted the,

87
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,610
you know, the z score takes into account
how long or how tall the baby is.

88
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,240
So, that's, that's sort of like a baby
BMI, and into a z score.

89
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,740
You can see that at the, at birth we had
63 measurements out of 64 so

90
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,050
one baby was actually missing the birth
weight.

91
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,440
You can see there's a lot of the interim
measurements are missing small amounts of

92
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,060
data, because not every baby had every
measurement, so just keep that in the back

93
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,930
of your mind, but again, I won't spend a
lot of time on checking the data here,

94
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,260
because everything looks pretty clean.

95
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,280
They also had, so there were three outcome
variables that I looked at.

96
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,180
So the weight for length z-score, that's a
z-score, adjusted for height.

97
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,360
The authors also had provided a BMI
z-score.

98
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,790
But that was only available for the
infants after they turned two years of

99
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:03,608
age, and that's because this conversion to
a z-score is based on population norms,

100
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:08,100
and they only, there is only a conversion
after the babies are older than two.

101
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,640
So they are, there's not a calculation for
it prior to two years of age.

102
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,720
So we only have that available for three
time points,

103
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,580
the 11th, 12th and 13th measurements in
this data set.

104
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,800
And I also looked at weight in kilograms
as an outcome.

105
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,195
Again that was measured at all 13 time
points.

106
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:33,675
Few things to notice, the the max of 24.3
kilograms, this is at the fourth birthday,

107
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:36,530
that, that's a little high but it's
probably a real baby.

108
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,920
But we'll see when we graph it that, that
baby actually stands out a little bit as

109
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,000
having a little bit higher then everybody
else.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,290
But again, I don't think it's an error,

111
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,050
I think it's just an extreme value that
we'll need to consider.

112
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,250
So, data set looks pretty clean.

113
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,220
I then went ahead and went through each
variable, and asked for

114
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,460
univariate statistics and histograms on
each variable separately.

115
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,830
So that I could just understand the
variables in my data set.

116
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:06,000
I also examined correlation structures,
using, using the broad form of the data.

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,300
Because I know we're going to be doing
dealing with repeated measures

118
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,920
outcome here.

119
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,930
we, it's important to understand the
correlation or

120
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,280
covariant structure of those repeated
measures outcomes.

121
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,220
Now at the end of the day, we ended up
using a random effects.

122
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,550
I ended up using a random effects model
for this data, and

123
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,330
you don't actually have to do much in
terms of specifying the, within

124
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,710
subject correlation across time points,
when you do the random effects model.

125
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,836
But if we were doing a generalized
estimating equation, or

126
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:35,281
a proc mixed with a repeated statement,

127
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:38,310
we would really need to understand those
correlation structures.

128
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,600
So they were important enough that I
tackled them early.

129
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,930
So first of all I went through and took,
for all my variables that are not my

130
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,450
repeated measures variables I went ahead
and asked for my simple statistics.

131
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,090
Yeah, in SASS, you can do that with a proc
univariate.

132
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,660
I'm just, going to go through these
quickly.

133
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,860
So one thing to notice is that on the
group variable.

134
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:07,330
The original trial enrolled 89 women, but
only 64 women provided data about their,

135
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,190
their infant's weight trajectory over time
because, again,

136
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,500
this is a second-degree analysis.

137
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,090
So it turned out that the women who had
been in the intervention group,

138
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,060
that's group equals one is the
intervention.

139
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,110
You know, they're probably a little bit
more motivated, because more of

140
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,760
them provided that follow up data on their
infants than women from the control group.

141
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,785
So we have slightly more women from the
intervention group here,

142
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:32,710
and you just going to keep that in mind.

143
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,399
There was about half of them had smoked at
some time during their lives.

144
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,790
They exclusively breast fed for an average
of three months.

145
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:45,804
They introduced solids at almost five
months.

146
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:48,660
Most of them, 89% were employed.

147
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,420
About 3% had an abnormally high birth
weight.

148
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,240
And about 17 to 18% had a low birth
weight.

149
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,470
There's only 42% girls so slightly fewer
girls in this data set than boys.

150
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,540
The average maternal age was about 29.

151
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,450
The, the pre-pregnancy BMI was about 22.

152
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,610
So this is a relatively light group of
women.

153
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,308
They're not on average overweight.

154
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:16,240
About 12% would be considered having a,
not a, a high birth weight, but

155
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,460
sort of being bigger than normal at birth.

156
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,940
The average maternal weight gain was about
15 kilograms, just you know,

157
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,310
30, 35 pounds, and so on and so forth.

158
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,500
So I went ahead and just looked at the
simple variables, then I went and

159
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,390
looked at the covariance and correlation
structures of my three outcome variables,

160
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,630
my weight for length z-score which was
measured at 13 time points.

161
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,321
My weight in kilograms also mentioned at
13 time points, and

162
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:43,930
my BMI z-score which is only measured at
three time points.

163
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,610
So you can see this is a little unwieldy,
this is the weight for length z-score.

164
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,520
So they've been adjusted for how big, how
long the baby or tall the baby is,

165
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,320
as well as converted into a z-score, into
a standard deviation unit.

166
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,210
The pattern's a little bit harder to see
with the z-scores,

167
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,370
than it will be with the weights in
kilograms.

168
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,743
But you can see, for example the weight
for length z-score at time point one,

169
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,100
that's the birth weight, birth weight for
length z-score.

170
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,670
It has some correlation with the next time
they were measured, and

171
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,790
then some correlation with the third time
they were measured, but

172
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,900
pretty much falls off after there.

173
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,080
So just because you started a little above
average at birth,

174
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,090
doesn't mean you're going to be above
average forever.

175
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,973
And you can see the general pattern is
that, you know,

176
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:29,548
adjacent time points tend to be more
correlated to one another, and

177
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:32,620
then there's some drop off as you get
farther in time, and

178
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,260
sometimes even the correlations are
negative as you get further in time.

179
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,910
Remember that these time points are not
evenly spaced.

180
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,492
The first ten measurements are all within
the first year, so

181
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:44,150
they were measured quite frequently.

182
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,680
Measurements measurement ten corresponds
to the first birthday.

183
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,270
Measurement 11 corresponds to the second
birthday.

184
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,580
Measurement 12 corresponds to the third
birthday, and

185
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,550
measurement 13 corresponds to the, around
the fourth birthday.

186
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,941
So you'll notice there's a,

187
00:10:56,941 --> 00:11:00,051
kind of a high amount of correlation once
you get past the first year.

188
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:07,389
There's a fair amount of correlation
between, say you know, ten, 11 and 12.

189
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,054
As we get over here this is the
correlations between weights ten,

190
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:10,788
11, and 12.

191
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:14,522
So by the time you're one years old,
you're, it's pretty, if you're a big

192
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:19,150
baby at one you're might, more likely to
be a big baby at two, three, and four so.

193
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,650
You can see some correlations there.

194
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,300
So, the adjacent high points tend to be
more correlated.

195
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,120
Maybe stronger correlations after the
first year of birth.

196
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,970
There's no clear correlation structure
here, although maybe something like

197
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,120
an autoregressive or an independent would
be appropriate.

198
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,916
Unstructured's probably not going to work
here,

199
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,790
because we have far too many time points.

200
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,231
Exchangeable seems wrong as well, because
it doesn't look exchangeable to me.

201
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:44,018
The weights, if you just look at the
weights in kilograms,

202
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:46,935
the correlation structure is a little bit
easier to discern.

203
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:50,447
I think this one looks nice and
autoaggressive, because you can see this

204
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:54,637
clear pattern, that if you weighed a lot
at time point one, the correlation with

205
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:58,851
time point 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, it kind of
nicely goes down overtime.

206
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,790
You can kind of see that, and if you look
at week two the correlations again also go

207
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,732
down over time, and you'll see this
general pattern, so something like, again,

208
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:10,336
like an autoregressive or independent
would be most appropriate here.

209
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:12,673
The BMIs, these scores, there's only a few
of those,

210
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:14,690
you could model that one as an
unstructured.

211
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,800
Or maybe an,

212
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,600
again, an autoregressive further of apart
time points seem to be less correlated.

213
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,370
As you might expect with repeated measures
data.

214
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
I looked at histograms.

215
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,550
Again, this is the group variable.

216
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,690
You can that there's more intervention
women who provided these data than

217
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,470
control women.

218
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,664
So we need to at least think about that in
our interpretation of the findings.

219
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:40,525
just, you know, few things for fun, so,
about more than half the women had smoked

220
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:45,456
sometime in their life, the maternal age
was centered around 29, these are first

221
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:51,160
time mothers, and most of the women were
employed, a lot were edu, highly educated.

222
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,650
The maternal weight kind of centered
around 60 kilograms.

223
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,560
There's a few heavier women out to the
tail here for maternal BMI.

224
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,570
Maternal weight gain during pregnancy
follows a nice normal distribution.

225
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,870
They also, the author's also provided that
as a categorical variable.

226
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,610
Most women exclusively breast fed their
babies for about five months.

227
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,180
There's some variation on that.

228
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,330
Partial breastfeeding went up to 30
months,

229
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,870
that's continuing to breast feed after
you've introduced solid foods.

230
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,370
Birth weight looks nice and normal,
gestational age has

231
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,090
a left tail because some of the weight
babies were born a little early.

232
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,330
And then I went ahead and

233
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:35,030
graphed all of the outcome variables at
each time point, in separate histograms.

234
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,149
What I'm looking for

235
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:40,260
here is, we're going to be running linear
models, linear mixed models.

236
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,115
And so we want the outcome variable to be
at least reasonably normally distributed,

237
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,665
and you can see that this is for weight,
so the weights,

238
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:50,032
it doesn't look like a perfect normal
distribution, I've shown you a,

239
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:53,000
a sampling of the different time points
here.

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,160
But looks probably close enough, good
enough for running linear models.

241
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,910
Here's weights at the first birthday, the
second, third, and fourth birthdays.

242
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,480
It's not perfectly normally distributed,
but good enough to run our linear models.

243
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,250
And here's the one baby who had a little
bit of a higher weight.

244
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,214
At the fourth birthday, it's a little bit
of an outlier there,

245
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:11,450
that we need to think about.

246
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,207
The weight for life z-scores, I also
looked at those,

247
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:18,170
they also look reasonably, normally
distributed, good enough to,

248
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,540
to be able to run linear models.

249
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,350
So, after you kind of get a feel for all
the different variables in your data set,

250
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,610
then, we need to think about missing data.

251
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,010
So, I just wanted to just first quantify
the missing data.

252
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,503
So, I ran a little macro.

253
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:37,975
And all that macro is doing is, it's
identifying for each measurement,

254
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:41,730
there's different missing data at
different measurements for these babies.

255
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,270
At each different measurement for the
weight for life z-score, I asked for

256
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,069
SASS just to to save the, the number of,

257
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:53,071
to save a new data set with all the babies
who were missing data, for

258
00:14:53,071 --> 00:14:57,124
that outcome for that time point, and then
just to print them out to me.

259
00:14:57,124 --> 00:15:00,646
It's just a quick way to get a sense of
how many babies are missing data at

260
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:03,596
each time point, missing outcome data at
each time point.

261
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:07,602
And so, this is just a sampling of what I
came up with.

262
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:09,010
So this is the first time point.

263
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,870
One maybe was missing a weight for length
z-score score at birth.

264
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,810
You would hope you could get that data
point but for

265
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,550
whatever reason they didn't have it, but
that baby did have it for

266
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,290
the second measurement so their only
missing that first one.

267
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,990
There was actually 21 babies who

268
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,550
were missing that second week for length
z-score.

269
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,370
Well, probably not every baby comes in
right after they're born for

270
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,090
another checkup, or somehow that data, the
mothers didn't collect that data.

271
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:38,000
So we're missing the most number of babies
for that second time point,

272
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,140
but remember these babies were measured up
to ten times in the first year of life.

273
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,330
So it's probably okay if there a few of
babies here and

274
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,980
there are missing various of these interim
measurements.

275
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,610
I went through and counted how many babies
were missing weight for

276
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,310
length z-scores at each one of these time
periods, and I've written them out here.

277
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,080
It's good that the later time points,

278
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,020
which represent the older ages, there
aren't that many missing data points.

279
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,380
Because almost everybody, well everybody,
probably goes in for

280
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,490
their first birthday checkup, their second
birthday checkup and so on.

281
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,880
They may not get all of their checkups
within the first year.

282
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,010
So it's just good to know the pattern of
missing data to have an understanding of

283
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:16,550
what's there.

284
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,220
And then we have to think about how we're
going to handle missing data for

285
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,220
this particular example.

286
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,363
So first of all, the more important
missing data are actually not available to

287
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:27,070
us in this data set.

288
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,910
So remember that the original randomized
trial had 89 women in it.

289
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,840
Only 64 of those women were able to
provide data on their babies.

290
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,140
So we actually had, essentially, 25
dropouts.

291
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,610
And that could have a lot of influence
because you can imagine that perhaps

292
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:48,130
the mothers who were most embarrassed
about by their baby's weight gains or,

293
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,220
you know, were most,

294
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,330
were least concerned about their baby's
weight gains, or something.

295
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,870
There's something, there could be some
bias,

296
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,100
in terms of who actually provides that
followup data.

297
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,140
The fact that the women weren't willing to
provide it, or

298
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,130
didn't have it, might say something.

299
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,550
So we need to consider that.

300
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,080
This is a secondary end point from the
clinical trial.

301
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,670
Therefore we're not going to be using
intention to treat analysis, so

302
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,640
we don't necessarily need to include those
dropouts in any way in some kind of

303
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,760
intention to treat analysis.

304
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,140
However we should explore what's different
about the dropouts,

305
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,420
try to do, if we had these data, we could
try to do some sensitivity analyses,

306
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,940
where we said if everybody that dropped
out, you know,

307
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,120
their babies had abnormally high weight
gain, how would that affect the results?

308
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,580
We could do some kind of sensitivity
analysis if we had those data,

309
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,260
we actually don't have them, so we're
really not going to be able to do

310
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,420
much here, although ideally if this was
our data set, we would be able to.

311
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,810
On the other hand, the missing interim
data, the fact that at a given time point,

312
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,730
some babies are missing data for given
measurement.

313
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,240
That actually I'm not going to worry so
much about for this dataset.

314
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,240
All of the babies have a large number of
weight measurements.

315
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,370
And just if there missing one or two
during their first year of life,

316
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,700
that doesn't in all impede my ability to
draw a growth curve for them.

317
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,620
They can measure one baby, you know?

318
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,960
Was supposed to be measured here, here and
maybe missed the third measurement and

319
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,180
then, you know, missed the fifth
measurement and so

320
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,370
on, but, you know, has the majority of the
measurements, I'm going to be able to

321
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,940
draw a nice growth curve for that baby
even missing a few interim measurements.

322
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,200
So it's not going to be a big deal,

323
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,759
I'm not going to actually try to fill in
that missing data in any way.

324
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,570
And remember the mixed models handle the
missing data just fine.

325
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,930
Again, it's just going to, if the baby
doesn't have data for

326
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,410
that time point, it's just going to leave
it out.

327
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,050
But the babies, doesn't,

328
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,420
you don't need to have complete data in
order to be included in those models.

329
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,990
So we're not going to worry too much about
the missing interim data,

330
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,420
although it's important to understand how
much of that missing data we have.

331
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,440
The next thing I did was to explore simple
relationships,

332
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,110
simple bivariate relationships between the
different variables in my data set

333
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,150
relationships between the variables in my
data set and the outcome variables.

334
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,400
As well as to start thinking about some of
the assumption that

335
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,850
we're going to have here.

336
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,970
Among the assumptions we have,

337
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,260
we need a normally distributed outcome, we
already kind of looked at that.

338
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:07,160
We also need to think about what is the
shape of the growth curve over time?

339
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,300
It's probably not going to be linear, so

340
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,970
we can't just throw time into our model
and and that's good enough.

341
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,550
We don't want to fit straight lines here.

342
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,340
We're probably going to need to fit either
something quadratic or

343
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,770
cubic, something more complicated.

344
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,970
So we really need to think about the shape
of that growth trajectory for these data.

345
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,330
So I went ahead and ran some correlation
matrices

346
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,440
between the variables that are not
repeated measures variables.

347
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,500
Just of interest to see what variables
tend to go together.

348
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,280
So some interesting things.

349
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,510
If you look the luckily there's not too
much going on with group,

350
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,950
we're hoping the two groups are relatively
balanced.

351
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,550
It looks like they are reasonably
balanced,

352
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,710
there's not huge correlations with any
confounders in our data set.

353
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,450
What's interesting to me is that if you
look at the ever smoking variable,

354
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,460
women who have ever smoked gained more
weight during pregnancy.

355
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,450
They were higher in their weights before
pregnancy.

356
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,900
And again, gained more weight during
pregnancy.

357
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,740
They were less likely to breastfeed, they
introduced solids earlier.

358
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,910
So even though you tend to think of women
wanting to smoke to

359
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,490
keep their weight down, in fact, that
correlated with higher weight and

360
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:17,040
probably ever smoking is some kind of
proxy here for socioeconomic status.

361
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,290
So the women who have ever smoke generally
tend to be less healthy in general.

362
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:25,360
More educated women, exclusively breastfed
for longer.

363
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,350
They also tended to be a little bit older,
as you might expect.

364
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,550
Partial and exclusive breastfeeding tend
to go together, you know,

365
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,760
there's a lot of things we can look at
here.

366
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,849
employment, you're more likely to be a
little bit older if you were employed.

367
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,390
And so on.

368
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,130
We can look at, you know this is an
interesting pattern.

369
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,550
So ever smoking seems to correlate with
some kind of worse health habits.

370
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,180
Being more educated tends to correlate
with better things, as you might expect.

371
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,800
The, maternal age again correlates with
the education and

372
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,555
employment, as you might expect.

373
00:20:58,555 --> 00:21:02,030
The ever smoking again correlates with
maternal weight, so

374
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,560
you can see all kinds of these patterns.

375
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,650
So it's just good to get a sense of how
the variables go together in

376
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,270
this data set.

377
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,270
I then went ahead and

378
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,460
graphed the growth trajectory for each
baby individually over time.

379
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,050
And I've done this separately for girls
and

380
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:21,070
boys, this is equivalent to figure two of
the BMJ open paper,

381
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,410
the authors actually showed this graph
because I think it is important.

382
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,980
It gives you the shape of the growth
trajectories over time.

383
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,030
What's interesting is that, you'll notice
that the girls have more variation in

384
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,410
their growth over time than the boys for
whatever reason in this data set.

385
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,800
You'll also notice that there is this one
baby,

386
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,270
this one girl who had a little bit of a
higher, weight gain over time.

387
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,640
She is in the control group.

388
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,640
So that could artificially make the
control group look like they're having,

389
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,880
you know, more weight gain over time.

390
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,210
So we will need to consider that.

391
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,370
The shape of the growth curves over time
is clearly not linear, right?

392
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,770
It is not a straight line.

393
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,850
As you would expect, that baby growth
would not follow a straight line.

394
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,730
So we're going to need to consider that in
the modeling.

395
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,710
When we're building our models,

396
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,650
we're not going to just be putting age in
as a linear term.

397
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,550
We are probably going to need to consider
cubics and quadratics here.

398
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,970
The other thing that you might do is, you
might say well, if you kind of look,

399
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:19,770
there's this high growth rate up until the
first year of age and

400
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,960
you know, that looks like a little bit of
a complicated shape.

401
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,860
It might be okay to model it as linear,
you can see after the first year of age,

402
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,970
it looks more linear, maybe not perfectly
linear.

403
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,300
Same thing over here.

404
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,330
So you could also think about breaking up
the data set into two time periods and

405
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,840
modeling those time periods separately.

406
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,600
That might be another way to handle the
data.

407
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,430
The fact that there are definitely not
linear.

408
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,080
[BLANK_AUDIO]

409
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,100
That was the weights.

410
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,900
The weights makes the prettiest graphic.

411
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,020
The weight for length Z score.

412
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,270
Remember this is a Z score.

413
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,160
And so it has a little bit funnier pattern
every time.

414
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,100
It's really hard to discern for these
individual growth lines.

415
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,870
Exactly what's going on with the Z score.

416
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,180
So you could easily be a standard
deviation above

417
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,060
average at birth, that doesn't necessarily
mean you're going to be

418
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,450
a standard deviation above average by the
time you're one years old.

419
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,450
And you can see there's a lot of kind of
going back and

420
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,220
forth, a lot of variation here.

421
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,920
So it's messy in the first year of life,

422
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,160
you can see a lot more kind of going back
and forth in the first year of life.

423
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,640
The BMI Z scores were only available after
the kids turned two, and so

424
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,330
you can see we only have it measured at
three time points but again it's

425
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,878
hard just in this individual growth line
to see exactly what the pattern is there.

426
00:23:27,878 --> 00:23:30,570
We're probably going to need to do some
mean plot to get a sense of the pattern.

427
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,530
So I went ahead and did some mean plots,
and

428
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,140
so I'm actually going to show you here.

429
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,950
I'm plotting, this is, what you see on
this screen are the girls only.

430
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,620
So I did girls and boys separately, just
to start with.

431
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,950
I plotted the mean, weight for lengths, Z
score the means, BMI Z score and

432
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,190
the mean weight at every visit.

433
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,220
And I"m treating time as categorical here.

434
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,740
But the blue line is the control group.

435
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,910
Then the red line is the intervention.

436
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,720
And interestingly enough, we do seem to

437
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,100
see some separation between the control
group and the intervention group.

438
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,110
Even in some of the earlier time points,
and

439
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,690
then especially at the later time points
by the time they are four.

440
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,690
You see that also for the BMI's, and

441
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,230
you see that also for the weeks in
absolute values.

442
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,520
So, little bit of a separation here and
here.

443
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,340
So it does look like the control group
seems to be gaining a little bit more

444
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,830
weight over time than the intervention
group, at least for the girls.

445
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:29,410
Interestingly if you look at the boys, we
don't see as strong of a pattern for

446
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,530
the boys.

447
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,590
In fact you can see that the intervention
group was a little heavier than

448
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,790
the control group at the early time
points, although it switches over by

449
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,439
the end, but those are really highly
overlapping graphs.

450
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,260
So, you, it makes you wonder these are,
there's very, this is

451
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,660
only 64 babies though, and there's, you
know, more boys than girls here.

452
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,590
So, there's not a huge number of boys and
girls.

453
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,660
The numbers are small, but it does make
you wonder if there's maybe some gender

454
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,530
interaction where the women who get the
intervention,

455
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:00,840
the counseling, somehow we're more worried
about their girl's growth trajectories or

456
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,310
it could just be chance that it happened
to show up in the girls but not the boys.

457
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,950
You see a little bit of separation on the
weight where the control group is

458
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,070
a little bit higher but again those lines
are highly overlapping, so it doesn't look

459
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,260
as like there's as much going on with the
boys but this could just be chance.

460
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,110
I will later consider a gender
interaction.

461
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,430
I then combine the boys and

462
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:24,265
the girls together to get enough, and here
to see what's really going on.

463
00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:27,420
Then you do see that it doesn't look like
there's much difference between

464
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,290
the control, and the intervention group at
the early time points.

465
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,820
But again at the end at, at the second,
third, and

466
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,310
fourth birthday, you do start to see some
separation for

467
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:39,410
the Z scores, for the weight, and also for
the BMI Z scores.

468
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,960
And it, in, you know in fact the authors
did

469
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,170
find a statistically significant
difference at the later time points.

470
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,400
So we're seeing a little something here,

471
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,460
it's not a huge effect, but a little bit
of separation.

472
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,870
And just to contrast it,

473
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:56,690
I went ahead and ran the same, graphic for
height just to show you.

474
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,720
Here's the graphic for height.

475
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,600
And you'll see that the two groups are
really overlapping for height.

476
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,940
So the separation you're seeing for weight
might actually mean something you know,

477
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,010
real clinically here.

478
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,980
The other thing to consider is what's the
shape of the curves.

479
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,840
It looks like, you know, again you're
probably getting, certainly not linear.

480
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,500
You're probably even for the Z score is
going to need quadratic, at least, and

481
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,170
maybe a cubic.

482
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,310
I then went ahead and did scatter plots
rather than mean plots.

483
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,310
I think the scatter plots are actually a
little bit nicer.

484
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,400
You can really see the shape of things.

485
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,580
So, what I'm graphing here is, here's age,
in months, on my x-axis.

486
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,540
This is the weight in kilograms, on my
y-axis.

487
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,620
And I'm graphing a separate line for each
clinic because one of

488
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,320
the the things that we're going to need to
worry about for

489
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,250
this data set, is the fact that we have a
cluster randomized trial.

490
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,080
And we had reanimization by clinic rather
than by individual.

491
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,210
So there's some potential that different
clinics have different road

492
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,380
trajectories because maybe their serving
slightly different populations.

493
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,760
So we needed to keep that in mind, we need
to look for clinic effects here.

494
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,050
So, I've done this graph.

495
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:05,550
And what I did was to go ahead, the blue
lines represent the control clinics,

496
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,160
that was clinics three, four and six.

497
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,480
And the red lines represent the
intervention clinics,

498
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,440
which is one, two and five.

499
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,860
And interestingly, you can see that there
doesn't appear to be a huge amount of

500
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,080
variation between the different clinics,
but the blue lines do tend to be a little

501
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,820
bit higher on weight, especially at the
later time points and the red clinics,

502
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,170
which are the intervention ones do tend to
be a little bit lower.

503
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:28,080
And there seems to be most of the
variation between different clinics seems

504
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,750
to correlate with whether or not you're in
the intervention or the control.

505
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,470
Again, you're going to look at the shape
of that graphic.

506
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,960
I would say that that looks like a cubic
shape to me.

507
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,730
It's not linear, clearly.

508
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,710
It's not quadratic.

509
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:46,230
It's probably cubic, it's kind of going
like this, so it's more of a cubic.

510
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,930
I then went ahead and did the same scatter
plots for the three outputs.

511
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:52,532
This is girls and boys combined, and I
graphed a red line for

512
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:56,510
the intervention group, a blue line for
the control group again.

513
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,499
And you can see again that there seems to
be some separation at

514
00:27:58,499 --> 00:28:00,995
these later time points where the control
were beginning a little bit more of

515
00:28:00,995 --> 00:28:03,340
a time in the red group seems to be going
down.

516
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,594
Now you can see that for weight, for
length Z score this is for

517
00:28:07,594 --> 00:28:10,940
the BMI Z scores and this is for weight
overall.

518
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,430
It's not a huge effect, but

519
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,720
there does seem to be something, a little
something going on.

520
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,970
Some separation at the later time points.

521
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,820
Notice that on the weight graph,

522
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:23,040
we've got this one girl, who was in the
control group, who is a little bit higher.

523
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,830
You can imagine that she could potentially
be pull, pulling this blue line up,

524
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,350
she could be having a lot of influence on
that line.

525
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,690
So we're going to need to consider how
much influence she's having on

526
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,460
the estimates, and we'll do that later on.

527
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,540
All right, so

528
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:41,180
I looked at all the shapes of the growth
trajectories over time, by clinic.

529
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,670
My intervention group, my individual, and
then just for

530
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:48,420
fun, I'll also went through and try to see
is there anything else,

531
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,740
is there any other predictors in my
variable obese,

532
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,760
in my data set besides intervention group
that correlate with baby weight gain?

533
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,000
And this is data from a randomized trial.

534
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,260
Actually, the groups ended up being fairly
balanced on all the covariants.

535
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,410
So we're probably not going to have to
adjust for any confounding here.

536
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,210
So this is just out of curiosity, to see,

537
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,330
is there anything else that predicts baby
weight gain over time?

538
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,360
I looked at the early time periods, this
is using the broad from the data set,

539
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,120
I looked just at the early time periods.

540
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,140
If you look at the early time periods, the
things that correlate with the baby's

541
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,170
weight tends to be how much weight the
mother's gained during pregnancy and

542
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,650
how big the babies were at birth, that
makes sense.

543
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:29,760
The later time periods, so when the baby
was one, she was three and four.

544
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,395
Interestingly it does appear that there is
some correlation with the age

545
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:35,240
at which solid foods are introduced.

546
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,880
So, introducing your solid food later is
correlated with having being

547
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,760
a little bit of a light baby, you know,

548
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,690
at least up until the second year, second
or third year of age.

549
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,879
So that's interesting, when you introduce
solid foods might have some effect.

550
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:56,980
So in the exclusive breastfeeding assuming
to have some correlation whereas

551
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,014
the babies that were exclusively breastfed
for longer tend to be a little bit

552
00:30:01,014 --> 00:30:05,448
lighter at least into their, you know,
again, third or fourth year of life.

553
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:07,765
I went ahead and did some graphs just for
fun.

554
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,565
So this was looking at the early solids.

555
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:14,436
So if you were in the green line they
introduced the solids the earliest age.

556
00:30:14,436 --> 00:30:18,310
The blue line represents introduced the
solids at the latest age.

557
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,020
And you can see there does seem to be
something going on,

558
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,895
although the lines are converging a little
bit by the fourth year of age.

559
00:30:23,895 --> 00:30:24,747
So at least in the second and

560
00:30:24,747 --> 00:30:26,907
third year of life it seems to have some
influence on the weight gain.

561
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:30,253
I'll show you later this actually does
turn out to be a statistically

562
00:30:30,253 --> 00:30:31,587
significant difference.

563
00:30:31,587 --> 00:30:34,696
I also look at maternal weight gain
because that seems to correlate,

564
00:30:34,696 --> 00:30:36,769
at least with the earlier time points, and

565
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:40,458
interestingly you do see some separation
where the women who gained the most

566
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:44,030
weight during pregnancy, their babies do
seem to be a little bit bigger,

567
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:48,430
at least in weight overall across time
periods, so we can look at that as well.

568
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,040
Again we're probably not going to have to
adjust for

569
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,370
these things because they're well-balanced
between the two groups.

570
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,880
The next thing we'd want to do is make our
formal descriptive table one for our

571
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,210
paper and any descriptive graphics that
we're going to want to make for our paper.

572
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:06,770
You, we've already made the graphics, so
I'll just show you the table one.

573
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:10,966
I got lazy here and the authors had
actually prepared a table one already so

574
00:31:10,966 --> 00:31:12,872
I didn't bother to recreate it.

575
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:16,406
I trust that they've done a good job in
compiling these data.

576
00:31:16,406 --> 00:31:19,451
The things to pay attention to is that we
do have slightly more numbers,

577
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:22,430
37 in the intervention group and 27 in the
control group.

578
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:26,900
However, if you look across at the
different, potential confounders,

579
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,160
it really does look like it's still fairly
well balanced between the two groups.

580
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,960
So there's probably not a lot we're going
to have to do in terms of worrying about

581
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,480
adjusting for confounding in our final
models.

582
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,190
And that's the nice thing about randomized
trials, you often get things that are very

583
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,580
nice and balanced, and you don't have to
worry about adjusting for confounding.

584
00:31:44,774 --> 00:31:47,974
We can also prepare some formal graphics
here as well.

585
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:51,785
For this is on paper obviously lends
itself to graphing so

586
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:56,643
we'd prepare some formal graphics as the
authors did to present in the paper.

587
00:31:56,643 --> 00:32:00,406
The next thing we're going to do is test
the main hypotheses.

588
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:05,770
Step seven and eight are kind of very
similar here because again,

589
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:09,110
I don't think we're going to be doing much
in the way of adjusting for confounding.

590
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:13,370
So I'm just going to reiterate here to
test the main hypothesis, for

591
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:16,360
repeated measures data I'm really going to
want to look at graphics.

592
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,108
So I've already shown you these graphics.

593
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:21,453
I'll just remind you then before we jump
to building the final models,

594
00:32:21,453 --> 00:32:23,695
the shape of the graphics does not look
linear.

595
00:32:23,695 --> 00:32:26,895
Girls look to have a little bit of a
bigger effect than boys,

596
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:29,700
I'm going to look at that in my final
models.

597
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,490
Here's the overall, it does appear that
there is some benefit for the control for

598
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,570
the intervention group at the later time
points compared with the control group.

599
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,560
I am going to have to worry about
within-clinic effects, that,

600
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,990
if there's any correlation within clinic.

601
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:47,080
But as I showed you already it doesn't
look like there's a huge amount of

602
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,410
variation between the different clinics
and most of the variation seems to be

603
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:54,010
explained by whether or not you're an
intervention clinic or a control clinic,

604
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,770
so it may turn out that there's not a lot
we have to worry about there.

605
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,390
And then I already showed you these
graphics as well.

606
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:03,800
All of these graphics are setting me up
for being able to build my final models.

607
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,710
So now we'll jump into building the final
models.

608
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,210
We're normally going to have to worry
about confounders, but

609
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:14,780
again, the covariates were well balanced
between the two groups,

610
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,160
even in the secondary data analysis, so

611
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,580
I'm actually not going to bother to try
adjusting for any confounders.

612
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,420
I also have explored the data enough to
know that none of

613
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:28,522
the covariates are terribly great
predictors of weight gain over time.

614
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:30,529
I'm going to look for an interaction with
gender,

615
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:33,528
just because in the pictures it did look
like the effect was bigger in girls.

616
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:35,276
I am at least going to test that.

617
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:39,374
And I'm going to need to think about in my
building these models here,

618
00:33:39,374 --> 00:33:43,541
the main thing I'm going to need to be
thinking about is how am I modeling,

619
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:46,388
how am I dealing with the repeated
measures, and

620
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:49,690
how am I dealing with the within-clinic
correlation?

621
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,910
So it's really about dealing with the
correlations.

622
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:55,370
Do I need to have a random intercept and a
random slope?

623
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:58,490
I'm going to be looking at models that
sometimes include a random slope,

624
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,840
sometimes don't include a random slope,
and

625
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,430
those are the things that I'm going to be
comparing here.

626
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:06,160
So I'm going to start, remember I had
three outcomes here.

627
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,530
I'm going to mostly focus on the
weight-for-length Z score,

628
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,500
my general process for the BMI Z score and
the weight, or

629
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,940
is, is pretty much the same.

630
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,470
So rather than show all of that, I'm just
going to show the process for

631
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,420
the weight-for-length Z score.

632
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:23,540
Here is the picture that corresponds to
the model that I am about to build.

633
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,130
Okay, so I'm going to build a model for
this data set.

634
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,820
You can see weight-for-length Z score
because of the Z score is not

635
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,520
necessarily going to increase over time.

636
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,600
However, it doesn't look like it's flat
over time.

637
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,010
Babies do seem to go up or down in their Z
scores.

638
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,510
And you do see at the later, the earlier
time points,

639
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,470
you're not seeing much difference between
the control and the intervention group,

640
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,100
but in the later time points you certainly
are.

641
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,930
I went ahead and ran a mixed model and I,
the authors of

642
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:50,550
this paper chose to use random effects
rather than a repeated statement.

643
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,880
I think that's a good choice because of
the fact that we have two sources of

644
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:01,172
correlation here, our observations are
clustered within

645
00:35:01,172 --> 00:35:06,310
individuals, and the individuals are then
clustered within clinics because this

646
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,590
is a cluster randomized trial.

647
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,880
And so we would call this a multi-level, a
three-level model essentially,

648
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,455
because we've got repeated measurements on
the same subject but

649
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:18,645
then we also have individuals clustered
within clinics.

650
00:35:18,645 --> 00:35:22,667
So this is well-handled by a random
effects model because we can put in

651
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:26,281
random effects for the individual subject
specific slopes and

652
00:35:26,281 --> 00:35:29,572
intercepts, as well as random effects for
the clinics.

653
00:35:29,572 --> 00:35:35,840
So we could also test if we need to put in
clinic specific intercepts and slopes.

654
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,683
So that's what I'm doing here.

655
00:35:37,683 --> 00:35:40,564
I already know that I'm going to need by
the,

656
00:35:40,564 --> 00:35:43,806
just by the picture that I'm going to need
quadratic and

657
00:35:43,806 --> 00:35:48,900
cubic terms if I'm modeling all the time
periods from zero to four years.

658
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,880
I'm going to need to put in a group by age
term.

659
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:58,290
I also did consider putting in a group by,
I also tried group by age by

660
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:02,370
age because maybe the quadratic function
might be different between the groups.

661
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:06,570
That turns out to be not significant and
the group by age cubed also turns out to

662
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,035
be non-significant, so I ended up with as
the authors did,

663
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:13,700
just ending up with a group by age term to
quantify the effect of the intervention.

664
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,850
Of course I'll need mean effects for those
as well.

665
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,040
I asked for confidence limits, I'm setting
my degrees of freedom at

666
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,348
this particular method of doing it, and
then I'm putting in a random statement for

667
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,489
clinic as well as a random statement for
individual.

668
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:29,321
And I'm starting by allowing there to be
subject-specific intercepts,

669
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:32,670
subject-specific slopes and
clinic-specific intercepts and

670
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,149
clinic-specific slopes.

671
00:36:34,149 --> 00:36:40,569
And when I run that model I get an AIC of
1692.

672
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:44,606
And you can see, however, when you look at
the covariance parameter estimates for

673
00:36:44,606 --> 00:36:46,864
clinic they are all very, very close to
zero.

674
00:36:46,864 --> 00:36:50,544
So what this is telling you is that there
isn't a lot of variation within clinic

675
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:52,520
between the different clinics.

676
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,190
So there probably isn't a lot of the,

677
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,710
the correlations within clinics are
probably really, really small.

678
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,150
There isn't a lot of difference between
the different clinics.

679
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,860
So that might suggest to us that we don't
need clinic-specific effects.

680
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,650
So I went ahead and I dropped the random
slope for clinic.

681
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,570
I left in the, random intercept for
clinic, but

682
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,630
I took out the random slope for clinic.

683
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,600
And when I did that, my AIC did get
slightly better at 1690.2,

684
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,870
and this was actually the best model that
I found.

685
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,160
So this is that final model that I ended
up going with.

686
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,820
I allowed there to be a, intercept, random
intercept for

687
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,470
clinic, but not a random slope for clinic.

688
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:38,660
I then went ahead and said do we need the
random slope for individual.

689
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,520
And, and you can see that even here we
probably don't even need

690
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,600
the random intercept for clinic,

691
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,950
because again, that variation between
clinics is almost zero at baseline.

692
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,930
I left it in anyway, it doesn't make a
huge difference here.

693
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:55,622
I went ahead then, however, and dropped,
the random effect for slope for

694
00:37:55,622 --> 00:37:59,150
the subject, the subject-specific slopes.

695
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,540
That turns out to be a bad idea, because
the AIC goes way up.

696
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,930
And the reason is that there really is a
lot of variation in

697
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,360
the growth trajectories over time for
different individuals.

698
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,920
So we really want to keep that random
slope in the model.

699
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,740
And that's, this is just the results from
that model,

700
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,029
you can see it has a really high AIC, so
probably not the best model here.

701
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,370
So here's my final model for the weight
for length Z score.

702
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:26,221
So you can see that indeed there's a
significant, here's the p value,

703
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:30,833
there's a significant effect for time,
there's a significant quadratic effect for

704
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:33,440
time, and a significant cubic effect for
time.

705
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,080
So we're going to keep all of those in.

706
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,160
However, the group by age term, which is
what we really care about,

707
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,030
that p value is not significant.

708
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,280
It does favor the intervention group, it's
negative,

709
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,790
saying that the intervention group has
less weight gain over time,

710
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,360
however it's not statistically
significant.

711
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,310
Well, this probably has to do with the
fact that the majority of the time points

712
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,120
are early, and at those time points,

713
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,899
it doesn't look to be a huge difference
between the groups.

714
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,790
I then went ahead and did test for

715
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:02,960
a gender interaction to see if the girls
whose mothers had the intervention did

716
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,130
better than the boys and so I put a group
by age by gender term in the model.

717
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,880
But however it came out to be totally
non-significant.

718
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,640
So even though it,

719
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,870
there is some suggestion that the girls
did better if their mothers were the,

720
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,680
in the intervention group, I didn't see
anything in modeling.

721
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,090
We have very low statistical power here to
detect the generate, gender interaction.

722
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,800
So what we saw could have just been
chance,

723
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,770
and I'm certainly not going to factor it
into my final model.

724
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,520
So then I went ahead and put together a
table two, similar to what the authors

725
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,150
have in the paper that reports the beta
coefficients for my weight-for-length

726
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:42,190
Z score model, for my weight in kilograms
model, and my BMI Z score model.

727
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:46,030
And you can see that the weight in
kilograms, the group

728
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:50,308
by age term approaches statistical
significance but doesn't quite make it.

729
00:39:50,308 --> 00:39:54,402
The BMI Z scores, which were only measured
in those later time points,

730
00:39:54,402 --> 00:39:57,474
does make statistical significance because
again,

731
00:39:57,474 --> 00:40:01,794
we did see some separation between the two
groups at the later time points.

732
00:40:01,794 --> 00:40:06,403
And just for fun, I thought it would be
very useful for your understanding of

733
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:10,651
what these models are doing to go ahead
and generate some graphics that

734
00:40:10,651 --> 00:40:15,137
actually graph the predicted values for
the individuals in the data set.

735
00:40:15,137 --> 00:40:19,044
So if you take, if you fit a model, you
can ask your computer to calculate

736
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:23,613
predicted values for everybody in the data
set and output them and then graph those.

737
00:40:23,613 --> 00:40:26,560
And that's really, that picture will show
you what,

738
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,263
what we've modeled, what the model looks
like.

739
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:30,920
So I went ahead and did this.

740
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,600
So here on the left-hand side, this is the
observed weight growth trajectories for

741
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,300
the, for the girls.

742
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,180
And then I went and got the predicted
values for the girls out of my model,

743
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,340
the model that I just showed you on for,
where the outcome was weight.

744
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,250
This had a cubic term in it as well as a
quadratic.

745
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,330
And you can see that indeed, and

746
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,780
then I just went ahead and got the
predictive values at each time point for

747
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,220
each woman, for each girl, and I just
connected those lines here.

748
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,650
And you can see that it indeed does appear
to have a nice cubic shape to it.

749
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:04,750
And it's basically a smoothed-over version
of the observed data.

750
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,740
And then, just to show you, in fact,

751
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:11,380
what we modeled was we modeled each growth
trajectory as a nice smooth cubic.

752
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:15,523
So I also went ahead and, rather than just
connecting the dots for each girl, I just,

753
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:19,340
you know, connected them as a cubic, which
is essentially what the model is.

754
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,170
So this is really kind of the model
picture.

755
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,830
This is, this picture corresponds to the
model.

756
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:27,210
This is what we've modeled, here with this
next model, with this cubic term in it.

757
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,700
Let's just help you understand what's the
difference between putting a linear term

758
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,020
in, a quadratic term, cubic term.

759
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,120
What does that really mean when we're

760
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,320
putting those complicated terms in the
model?

761
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,230
I went ahead and got the pre-, I fit new
models.

762
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:44,330
So I fit a new model where I only put in
an age term, so

763
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,110
I only modeled ages linear.

764
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,980
And these are the predicted values from
them all.

765
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,480
Well, you can see what we did was we fit a
line for each person.

766
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,383
And then I also did the same thing where I
only put a linear term in a quadratic, but

767
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:58,180
not a cubic term into the model and

768
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,000
you can see what we get is a quadratic
shape at the end of the day, and

769
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,940
here's the smooth quadratic shape, which
is really what the model fits.

770
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,750
Those clearly don't match the picture of
the observed data, so

771
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,090
we definitely need that cubic term.

772
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,630
And I did the same thing just to show you,
observed and

773
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,000
predicted for weight for boys, you get the
same idea.

774
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,990
We, we model the cubic.

775
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,660
I think these predicted graphics are
really helpful.

776
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,930
I also did an observed versus a predicted,
by clinic.

777
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:26,220
So here's the observed values, when I
graphed by clinic, blue lines for

778
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,184
the control clinics, red lines for the
intervention clinics.

779
00:42:29,184 --> 00:42:32,630
Here's the fitted model, the predicted
values for my fitted model and

780
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,020
you can see that clear cubic shape.

781
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,922
And, the, blue clinics are predicted to

782
00:42:38,922 --> 00:42:42,833
have little bit higher weight gain over
time.

783
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:46,294
And then again, just to kind of get to the
sense of what we mean by quadratic and

784
00:42:46,294 --> 00:42:49,437
cubic, I took out the cubic term and what
you can see is that if I take out

785
00:42:49,437 --> 00:42:53,141
the cubic term, then my model is actually
fit a quadratic function, not a cubic.

786
00:42:53,141 --> 00:42:56,276
And if I take out the quadratic term you
can see that my model has fit

787
00:42:56,276 --> 00:42:59,639
just a line for each clinic, which is
clearly not the right shape, but

788
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:02,660
that's what the quadratic, cubic and
linear terms all mean.

789
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,547
We're of course going to want to do some
model checks on our models, so

790
00:43:07,547 --> 00:43:09,713
I went ahead and asked for the residuals
for my models.

791
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,767
You can get that even out of proc mixed.

792
00:43:11,767 --> 00:43:14,816
You can see that we want the residuals to
be reasonably, normally distributed.

793
00:43:14,816 --> 00:43:16,169
That looks pretty good.

794
00:43:16,169 --> 00:43:20,034
You can plot the residuals and, you know
across time and things, and look for

795
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:20,773
any patterns.

796
00:43:20,773 --> 00:43:26,056
It looks like we're, we're meeting the
assumptions pretty well here.

797
00:43:26,056 --> 00:43:29,927
I then went ahead and limited the analysis
just to the later time points when

798
00:43:29,927 --> 00:43:32,024
the babies were two, three, and four.

799
00:43:32,024 --> 00:43:35,513
We already saw that there seems to be more
separation at those time points.

800
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:38,425
And so here's the picture that goes with
that, here's the observed data,

801
00:43:38,425 --> 00:43:40,435
which I've, this graph I've already showed
you.

802
00:43:40,435 --> 00:43:42,487
I then went ahead and fit a model.

803
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:48,119
So in this model, for weight-for-length Z
score, I took the same basic model but

804
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:52,301
cut the only model for the later time
points after the second,

805
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:56,940
including the second, third, and fourth
birthday visits.

806
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,980
And when you do that, you do see that as
we saw with the BMI Z scores,

807
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,720
the BMI Z scores were only available for
the later time.

808
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,090
We did have a separation between the
groups.

809
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,120
We see the same thing when we look at the
weight-for-length Z scores,

810
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,440
limited to the second, third, and fourth
birthdays.

811
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,040
We do get a significant result here as the
authors reported in the paper.

812
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,770
Now interestingly, if we're only looking
at these last three time points,

813
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,640
we probably don't need this age cubed term
anymore.

814
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,290
You know, you look at that, well, maybe
it's a little bit cubic,

815
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:25,290
but we may not need to actually fully
model that as a cubic.

816
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,940
So I went ahead and dropped the cubic
term, from the model.

817
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,470
So here is my observed and my predicted
when I include the cubic term.

818
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,240
This is the predicted on the right here.

819
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:35,980
This is the observed.

820
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,660
I actually then went ahead, and this is a
you know, if I really show you it,

821
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,652
here is if I just grab a smoothing line on
the predicted values.

822
00:44:44,652 --> 00:44:46,980
Here is if I actually graft that cubic one
on the predicted values.

823
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,740
As you can see maybe we don't need that
much curvature.

824
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,980
And I went ahead and dropped the cubic
term, and so

825
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,490
the quadratic term, the AIC turned out to
be sufficient.

826
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,754
We didn't really need that quadra, the
cubic term anymore.

827
00:44:56,754 --> 00:44:58,882
But you can see it didn't make a huge
difference on the P value for

828
00:44:58,882 --> 00:44:59,638
the group by age term.

829
00:44:59,638 --> 00:45:01,673
It's still statistically significant.

830
00:45:01,673 --> 00:45:02,958
Here's the observed versus.

831
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:06,646
I predicted, when I have the quadratic
term.

832
00:45:06,646 --> 00:45:09,512
So, I'm showing you now this is the
predictive where I'm just fitting

833
00:45:09,512 --> 00:45:12,712
a smoothing line to the predicted values,
and if I actually fit the quadratic to

834
00:45:12,712 --> 00:45:15,524
those predicted values you can see that
nice quadratic shape there.

835
00:45:15,524 --> 00:45:19,830
That sufficient to capture, the content of
the data here.

836
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,590
I also limited the weight outcome to 24 to
48 months.

837
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,940
Again, the group by age is also
statistically significant.

838
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,040
I only went up to the quadratic for
weight, as well.

839
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,160
So, we do get a nice separation at these
later time points.

840
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,930
Just for fun, I also looked at some other
predictors of weight gain over time.

841
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:39,630
So this is looking at the BMI Z scores.

842
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:42,780
These are again, only two, three, and four
years of age.

843
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,640
We already saw that maybe the age at which
you introduce solids to

844
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,490
the baby might have an influence on their
weight gain trajectory over time.

845
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:52,430
And, indeed, if you look at SolidAge.

846
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:57,630
Now this is, SolidAge is the age at which,
the month at which the baby was introduced

847
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:02,150
to solid foods, which is usually somewhere
around 4, 5, 6, 7 months.

848
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,630
And you can see now that the main effect
for

849
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,610
solid age is, solid age is statistically
significant.

850
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:11,619
because remember, that this were starting
baseline here, is two years of age, so

851
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:13,670
this is way after SolidAge.

852
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:18,300
The SolidAge foods have been introduced
but the baseline of this analysis,

853
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,300
which is at three years of age, the babies
who were fed solid foods back

854
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:27,240
earlier or later when, at a later age when
they were

855
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,900
young they are tracking about a half
standard deviation less in BMI Z score.

856
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,490
Or and it is statistically significant at
two years of age.

857
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:37,820
Some solid food interdiction seems to have
some influence here.

858
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:44,110
And then they continued, there continued
to be some significant effect here.

859
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:50,990
So, what's interesting is that the babies
who, had gotten their solids at a later

860
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:55,690
age they at two years they are lighter by
about half a standard deviation.

861
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:59,480
But they are actually catching up with the
other babies a little bit over time.

862
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,442
So, what you can see is that the SolidAge
by age.

863
00:47:03,442 --> 00:47:06,748
This interaction, i, what's happening is
that’s positive, so

864
00:47:06,748 --> 00:47:09,416
the later you were introduced to solids as
your goal for

865
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:13,300
being two years old, to three years old
[INAUDIBLE] to four years old.

866
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,470
You are actually catching up for

867
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:19,760
gaining a little bit more weight relative
to the ones who got solid at younger age,

868
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,400
but you started at two years at being, as
being quite a bit lighter.

869
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,770
So, there's a little bit of the curves
coming together there.

870
00:47:28,092 --> 00:47:31,670
All right, so the other thing that I just
wanted to throw in for learning purposes

871
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:36,440
here, was we have modeled this, we had a
proc mixed with random statements.

872
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,970
That actually handles the data really well
here,

873
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,850
because you can put in two random
statements, one for

874
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,500
clinic and one for subject.

875
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:46,900
But, I also wanted to illustrate, the fact
that you could also model these data with

876
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,140
a generalized estimating equation or with
a proc mixed with a repeated statement.

877
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,310
And I wanted to try to,

878
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:56,050
again, say what difference between those
three approaches are.

879
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:59,370
So, I went ahead and re-ran the exact same
model,

880
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:03,280
except I did it in proc mixed with a
repeated statement.

881
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,440
And then I asked [INAUDIBLE] to generate
the predicted values from those models.

882
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,490
And they're very informative, to look at
these graphics.

883
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:16,340
This is the predicted values, and I'm
graphing here by clinic,

884
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,460
so predicted values by clinic.

885
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,820
And this is from my proc mixed with the
random statement.

886
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,370
So, what you can see is, well gee, each
clinic is allowed,

887
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:33,550
all the clinics have different
trajectories of growth over time.

888
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:37,970
All the individuals are predicted to have
different growth trajectories over time.

889
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:42,320
There is variation, so a specific
individual has a different predicted

890
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,545
value even two individuals who are, are
from the same intervention group,

891
00:48:47,545 --> 00:48:49,800
they 're predicted to have different
values over time.

892
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,860
So, you get variation, you get scatter.

893
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,620
Now look over here.

894
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:56,270
Here, is the predicted values by clinic

895
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:02,910
from a proc mixed with a repeated
statement.

896
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,190
Might use I think an autoregressive
correlation structure.

897
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:09,520
And, what do you see here.

898
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,540
These are the predicted values.

899
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,920
So, there is no subject specific
variability, that's the whole point.

900
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,660
That the random effect builds in the
subject specific variability.

901
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,030
There's no variation.

902
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:22,080
So, from the proc mix with the repeated
statement,

903
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,740
you're getting a marginal model.

904
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:28,060
So every, anybody who's in the, any of the
intervention clinics is,

905
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,810
projected to have a specific value at each
of the time points.

906
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:31,490
And everybody who is in

907
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:34,590
the intervention clinics is projected to
have a specific value.

908
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:38,340
At specific time points and there's no
variation built into that.

909
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,750
We're not allowing subjects to vary from
that.

910
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,570
So, you can pictorially see the difference
between those two models.

911
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,660
You can clearly see that the proc mix or

912
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,310
the repeated statement is a marginal
model.

913
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:50,350
And then I also ran a generalized
estimating equation which is basically

914
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,660
doing the same thing as the proc mixed
with the repeated statement.

915
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,430
It's also fitting a marginal model.

916
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,020
So, you don't get any subject specific
effects.

917
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,400
Everybody is predicted to lie right on
that line.

918
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,870
And I just did it as again, looking at the
weights.

919
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:05,460
So, here's the predictive value of the
weights on the left hand side,

920
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,350
from the proc mixed with the repeated
statement.

921
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:09,720
Again, it's a marginal model, we're
predicting.

922
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,555
Two lines, your getting two lines here,

923
00:50:11,555 --> 00:50:15,350
because remember my model has intervention
group and control group in it.

924
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:16,890
So you're clearing seeing some difference.

925
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,920
For the this is with the intervention
group.

926
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,090
This would be the control group.

927
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,990
But everybody's projected to lie on that
line.

928
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:25,000
Only, the only thing you're allowed to
vary on is.

929
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,630
Whether you're intervention or control.

930
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:29,060
On the right side, here's the proc mixed
with the random statement.

931
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,710
And again, you can see that we're allowing
subject specific growth curve.

932
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,520
So, that's the difference between proc
mixed with the repeated statement, and

933
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,129
proc mixed with a random statement.

934
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,640
And the generalized estimating equation,
again, it's marginal model, so

935
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,670
it looks just like the proc mixed with the
repeated statement.

936
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:49,540
So, the next thing we'd want to do is to
do some sensitivity analyses.

937
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,680
The real sensitivity analyses that would
be best for

938
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,620
this data set would be to probe those 25
dropouts, and

939
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,800
see what influence those might have had on
the analysis.

940
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,370
We don't have those data.

941
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:00,610
So, the only sensitivity analysis I went
ahead and

942
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:05,650
did was to just notice that there was this
one baby in the control group, this girl,

943
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:09,260
who was quite a bit heavier and could be
pulling the blue line up.

944
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,930
It might be having a lot of influence on
our estimates.

945
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:14,870
So, I went ahead and ran the model with
her and then ran the model without her

946
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:17,940
just to see how much influence she might
be having on the estimates.

947
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,349
We wouldn't want one baby to be completely
pulling that line up.

948
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:25,500
So, when I ran the model with her, you've
already seen these estimates.

949
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,542
The group by age term had a P value of
0.005.

950
00:51:28,542 --> 00:51:31,310
So, fairly statistically significant.

951
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:35,183
When I remove that outlier, it still
remains statistically significant, but

952
00:51:35,183 --> 00:51:37,857
you can see that some of the effect is a
little bit less.

953
00:51:37,857 --> 00:51:40,662
So my data coefficient was negative .035.

954
00:51:40,662 --> 00:51:44,451
And this for weight so that corresponds to

955
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:49,520
.035 kilograms less per ages and months,
for months.

956
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,300
The effect size is a little bit lower when
we take that girl out,

957
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:56,310
and also the p-value is still significant,
but you know, a little bit higher.

958
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:58,240
So, she is having some influence on the
estimates,

959
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,730
although taking her out doesn't completely
we don't completely lose the effect.

960
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:04,330
We still seem to have the effect even if
she's not in there.

961
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:10,770
So, you want to do some analysis like that
to probe potentially influential values.

962
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,010
And then, finally,

963
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,430
we're going to want to create some formal
graphics that summarize the findings.

964
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:16,920
I've already shown you a ton of graphics
and easily, a lot of,

965
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,530
a number of those graphics could be
formalized to include in the paper.

966
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:23,570
I'll just show you the graphic that the
authors actually chose to include in

967
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:24,820
their paper.

968
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:29,070
Here is the observe that I like to show
observe along with projected, predicted.

969
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:32,532
So, here is my observed graphs that I
already showed you for the week.

970
00:52:32,532 --> 00:52:34,690
For length score, and for the BMI Z score,

971
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:40,670
what the authors showed in their paper was
the fitted curves from their mixed models.

972
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:44,590
For this is the, control group in the
dotted line.

973
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:48,050
And this is the intervention group in the
smooth line.

974
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,510
This is for the weight for length z-score.

975
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,850
And this is for the BMI Z score.

976
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:59,610
So these are kind of the [INAUDIBLE] the
smooth version of the observed graphs.

977
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,890
And, this is exactly what the model fits,
the model fits for weight length score,

978
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,710
we fit cubits, as you can see,

979
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:08,370
those are cleric cubits with the control
grouping a little higher.

980
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,685
The Z score for

981
00:53:09,685 --> 00:53:13,050
BMI, we fit a quadratic, and the control
group ends up a little bit higher.

982
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:15,730
So, those are just their, they're showing
the fit graph, they're showing.

983
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,520
That the model projects the control group
to be a little bit higher than

984
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,850
the intervention group.

985
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:23,360
The dots you're seeing on these graphics,
I think, are not the prettiest thing, but

986
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,310
they're showing the mean value for all,
for the weight for

987
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:30,320
length score or the BMI Z score in the
intervention and control groups.

988
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,700
So, those are the observed values, the
lines are the fitted values.

989
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,400
So, that's one possible graphic that you
could present, and again,

990
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,480
I've shown you a number of other graphics.

991
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,470
That would make nice pictures for the
paper.

992
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:44,830
