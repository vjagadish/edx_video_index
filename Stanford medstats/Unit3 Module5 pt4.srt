1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,490
Proc freq is very useful because in
addition to creating contingency tables

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,400
like we've showed you before,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,140
you can also write table analysis like a
Chi Squared Test.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,690
let's take at some code.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,540
Here we have the code for a contingency
table like we saw before.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,780
But we've added something new in the
options for the table statement.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,730
If you look closely you'll see CHISQ which
specifies some statistical options.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,620
Let's take a look at the output.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,840
SAS runs a whole bunch of statistics on
our table.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,300
If you look down at this table it says
statistics for

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,590
table of isTreated by isCured.

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,620
You can see the results of these tests.

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,620
The column statistic shows you the name of
the test that was performed.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,330
DF stands for degrees of freedom.

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,720
Value shows the value of the statistic for
the specific test that you ran.

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,460
And prob gives you the P value for that
test.

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,810
The first statistic listed here is a chi
square test.

18
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,900
>> As you will learn in your HRP classes.

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,300
The Chi Square Statistic is used to
determine whether distributions of

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,540
categorical variables are different from
one another.

21
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,510
In other words the Chi Square Statistics
compares categorical responses between

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,150
independent groups.

23
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,840
This test cannot be used to analyze
proportions, percents, means, and so on.

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,500
In our example, we have a class square
value of 36.9 with one degree of

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,190
freedom and a p value of less than .0001.

26
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,980
This significant P value indicates that we

27
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,110
can reject the null hypothesis that there
is no association between.

28
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,340
Between the exposure and outcome.

29
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,260
In an earlier module,

30
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,730
we showed you how you can setup a two by
two table to calculate a relative risk.

31
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,940
What if we want SAS to calculate this
relative risk for us?

32
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,800
First we need to sort our data in
descending order.

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,530
When SAS makes a contingency table with
Proc Freq,

34
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,450
it'll order the columns in the order they
show up in the data.

35
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,200
This will affect how it calculates the
relative risk.

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,860
So, first we use Proc Sort to sort our
data in

37
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,500
descending order by exposure and outcome.

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,930
This way the ones will show up first in
our contingency table.

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,970
Next we specify order equals data in our
Proc Free Statement.

40
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,550
Finally, we include well risk after the
forward slash and a table statement and

41
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,770
everything else in Proc Freq is just the
same as it was before.

42
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,420
So, let's run this and look at the output.

43
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,939
SAS will automatically calculate an odds
ratio as well as a risk ratio.

44
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,560
Depending on the type of study you're
using,

45
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,940
you might not be able to use a risk ratio.

46
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,700
In this case, a risk ratio should work
just fine.

47
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,370
The second row shows the chance of getting
cured in those who

48
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,000
were treated versus those who were not
treated.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,772
And the risk ratio is 2.1.

50
00:02:31,772 --> 00:02:36,800
>> Next we'll take a look at another
example from our data set on marriage.

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,760
If we include this where statement, we can
restrict the analysis to women only.

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,810
In an earlier module we showed you how to
run a by statement to run an analysis

53
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,210
multiple times for different subsets of
the data based on an additional variable.

54
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,960
If you're using Proc Freq, there's another
way how to do this.

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,120
Take a look at this code,

56
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,540
you'll see that we have three variables in
the table statement.

57
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,510
The last two variables, race and

58
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,790
marital stat create a contingency table,
just like we've seen so far.

59
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,200
The first variable functions just like a
by statement.

60
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,780
This will allow you to create multiple two
by two tables of race versus marital stat,

61
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,280
for each level of the gender variable.

62
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,140
Here, let's look at the code.

63
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,310
As you can see, we have two tables.

64
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,680
One of them says controlling for

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,460
gender equals zero and the other one says
controlling for gender equals one.
