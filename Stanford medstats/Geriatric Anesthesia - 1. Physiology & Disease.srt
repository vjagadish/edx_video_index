00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:22,990
Hi.

3
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,240
I'm Doctor Kevin Jenner.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,700
I'm an Anesthesiology resident at the
Medical College of Wisconsin.

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,730
In this video we'll be discussing the
Essentials of Geriatric Physiology.

6
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,110
It's important to remember that this is
only an overview of this topic.

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,560
In order to become proficient, you will
need to do additional study and

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,650
seek out additional resources.

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,120
Before we begin I'd like to thank Doctor
Larry Chu and

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,750
the rest of the staff at the Stanford
Anesthesia Informatics and Media Lab,

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,570
here in Stanford, California for inviting
me here to participate in this project.

12
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,070
And for assisting me with the creation of
these videos.

13
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,270
So let's get started.

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,330
We'll begin by reviewing the objectives of
this particular module and

15
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,120
this particular video.

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,070
After you've finished viewing this video,
we hope that you'll be able to better

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,830
explain the concept of functional reserve,
and how it changes as patients age.

18
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,180
In addition, we hope that you'll be able
to describe some of the comorbidities that

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,930
are more common amongst geriatric patients
than amongst younger patients.

20
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,000
And lastly, we hope that you'll be able to
explain some of the changes of the aging,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,035
and how they may affect the various
aspects of your anesthetic care and

22
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:29,290
postoperative care for geriatric patients.

23
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,410
Let's begin by discussing functional
reserve.

24
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,050
Functional reserve is the ability of a
person's body or

25
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,859
organ systems to adapt to and overcome
various physiologic stresses.

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,140
And as people age there's an overall
decrease in functional reserve.

27
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,010
The human body becomes less able to handle
physiologic stress.

28
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,150
Physiologic stress may result from injury
or

29
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,510
trauma, or from a surgical procedure or
delivery of an anesthetic.

30
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,950
Hospitalization is also a particularly
particularly common,

31
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,650
physiologic stress, that geriatric
patients may experience.

32
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,970
Keep in mind, not every patient ages in
exactly the same way.

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,220
Due to previous co, previous disease,
previous surgeries, or previous injuries.

34
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,090
Some patients may have a less,

35
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,410
less of a functional reserve than other
patients of the exact same age.

36
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,780
This is where the idea of a persons
physiologic age versus their true age

37
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,460
comes from.

38
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,460
When a person's chart says that they are
80 or 85 years old or any other age,

39
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,550
it's important to consider that that is
not a particular effective or

40
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:50,440
accurate marker at determining how old
that patient's body systems may be.

41
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,750
Patients with extensive comorbidities or
coexisting disease may actually

42
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,020
have a much older physiologic age than
their true age would lead you to believe.

43
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,810
That's why it's very important to perform
a thorough preoperative history and

44
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,990
physical examination on all of your
patients.

45
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,720
And especially on geriatric patients, in
order to determine how their organ systems

46
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,430
may behave under the physiologic stress of
anaesthetic, of an anaesthetic or

47
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,240
a surgical procedure.

48
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,660
In addition, organ systems within each
individual's body

49
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,700
may age differently as well.

50
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,600
Within one body, a person's kidneys or
lungs may behave maybe at

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,800
a different physiological age than their
heart or other organ systems.

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Keep this in mind as well, since there is
no specific marker to

53
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,690
say how one's organ systems are doing in
general.

54
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,550
Each organ system must be discussed and

55
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,380
evaluated individually within a single
individual.

56
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,640
Frailty is something that we

57
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,390
sometimes hear about in the medical
profession as well.

58
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:57,910
And it's the concept that if a person's
functional reserve is not large enough or

59
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,740
not great enough in order to withstand a
physiologic stress.

60
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,860
That they may end up disabled or less
functional or

61
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,910
independent than they did when they came
to the hospital for

62
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,740
a procedure or, or prior to the
physiologic stress.

63
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,190
So, prot, frailty is basically saying you
know,

64
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,990
if, if a person is having problems with
organ systems and

65
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,785
then we add to that by performing an
anesthetic or doing a procedure.

66
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:28,370
That it may actually make things worse to
the point where they can never recover

67
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,550
exactly to the same point that they were
at before they came to the hospital.

68
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,600
Aging is associated with changes in the
brain and

69
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,350
neurologic systems which you should know
about.

70
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,510
These include things like a decrease in
overall cerebral brain mass.

71
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,950
And many patients who are geriatric do
have what could be

72
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,340
diagnosed as cerebral atrophy on head CT
or head MRI scans.

73
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:57,320
In addition, geriatric patients have a
decreased sensitivity to pain.

74
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,840
And painful stimuli compared with younger
patients.

75
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,030
Geriatric patients are also more likely to
have of these

76
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,990
common comorbidities than younger
patients.

77
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,450
They include things like Dementia,

78
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:14,710
Parkinson's Disease, Stroke, Peripheral
Neuropathy, Chronic Pain or Depression.

79
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,030
Keep in mind, things like Dementia are
particularly common amongst

80
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,358
geriatric patients, and very uncommon
amongst younger patients.

81
00:05:21,358 --> 00:05:26,750
In fact, 13.9% of patients over the age of
70 have some form of dementia.

82
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,460
To break that down a little bit more,
Alzheimer's dementia,

83
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,680
perhaps the most well known of all of the
dementias is largely affects patients over

84
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,088
the age of 65 years.

85
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:43,810
In fact 5.2 million of the 5.4 million
total pe, individuals

86
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,720
in the United States diagnosed with
Alzheimer's dementia, are age 65 or over.

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,310
That means that, only 200,000 patients who
have Alzheimer's dementia

88
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,800
are under the age of 65 in the United
States.

89
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,130
One in eight patients over the age of 65
has some form of,

90
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,380
some variety or degree of Alzheimer's
dementia.

91
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,920
In addition, Parkinson's disease is more
common amongst the elderly.

92
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,385
Only 4% of patients with Parkinson's
disease are under the age of 50, while

93
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:19,480
96% of the patients who have Parkinson's
Disease are over the age of 50.

94
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,530
In all there's 500,000 to 1 million
patients in the United States with

95
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,503
Parkinson's Disease at any given time.

96
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:30,950
And 50,000 to 60,000 additional new cases
are diagnosed each year.

97
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,780
Stroke is also a disease that particu,

98
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,380
strokes are more common amongst geriatric
patients.

99
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:44,230
In all, there's about 795,000 strokes that
occur in the united states each year,

100
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,820
and three quarters of those are current
patients aged 65 and older.

101
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,460
Pain and peripheral neuropathy are
particularly common in geriatric patients.

102
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,100
A study that was performed and result, and

103
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,248
discussed in the American Journal of
Geriatric Pharmacology.

104
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:04,090
Of 1,000 geriatric patients living in the
community

105
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,950
with an average age of 75.3 years,
indicated that 74% of those patients

106
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,385
reported that they had pain at some point
during the preceding 30 days.

107
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:18,550
52% of the patients in that study
indicated that they had pain every day.

108
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,100
And 26% of those thousand patients
indicated that

109
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,910
their pain was agonizing in terms of its
severity.

110
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,920
Keep that in mind when working with
geriatric patients.

111
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,160
They may not be as sensitive to pain as
younger patients but

112
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,070
they may more commonly have daily pain or
frequent pain.

113
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,190
And they may be treated it with over the
counter medications that

114
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,180
it's important you ask about.

115
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,850
In addition geriatric patients suffer from
depression just as

116
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,290
other patient populations do.

117
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,790
Of the 31 million geriatric patients in
this country age 65 and

118
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,935
over five million of those patients have
some symptoms of depression and

119
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:01,210
one million of those 31 million patients
has some form of major depression or

120
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,160
some degree of major depression.

121
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,530
Keep this in mind as patients may be
taking medications that are related,

122
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,340
antidepressant medications.

123
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,860
And that may include tricyclic
antidepressants which can interfere with

124
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,030
some of the anesthetics or

125
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,220
oth, other medications that we may use in
in anesthesiology.

126
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:26,020
Next let's discuss Delirium and
Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunction.

127
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,150
Delirium is defined as a change in mental
status that is characterized by

128
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:34,840
a reduced awareness of the environment,
and a disturbance in attention.

129
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,170
Both of these characteristics must be
present in order for

130
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,890
the diagnosis of delirium to be made.

131
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,380
Delirium is more common amongst geriatric
patients than amongst their

132
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,250
younger counterparts.

133
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,060
In addition, keep in mind that
post-operative delirium is,

134
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:55,770
is somewhat different, in terms of it's
prognosis than is medical delirium.

135
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,530
When patients present for a, to the
hospital for a surgical procedure, and

136
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,830
then develop delirium following that
operation, they're more likely to

137
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,190
recover fully from that delirium, than
patients who presented at the hospital for

138
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,260
a medical reason and subsequently
developed delirium during their

139
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,010
hospitalization without undergoing
surgery.

140
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:22,490
Keep in mind also that studies have shown
that there is a reduced risk of delirium,

141
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,910
in patients who receive a regional
anesthetic and not a general anesthetic.

142
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,890
So regional techniques may be useful in
reducing the risk of delirium in

143
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,480
geriatric patients.

144
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,300
Keep that in mind when choosing the
anesthetic technique that you'll be

145
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,349
using for your patients.

146
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,310
This is particularly important because
there is a well known

147
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,370
associated increase in morbidity and

148
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,900
mortality amongst patients who have some
form of post-operative delirium.

149
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,763
If we can avoid this, it's important that
we try to do so.

150
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:55,620
Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunction is
somewhat, is different from delirium,

151
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,440
in that it is a deterioration in
Cognition, that tends to

152
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,340
be temporally associated with the
occurrence of a surgical procedure.

153
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,540
This may be particularly minor or

154
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,480
it may be major in the way it affects the
person's life.

155
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,010
It could be that they have word finding
difficulty for

156
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,700
a few weeks after the procedure that
improves with time.

157
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,700
It may be that they have trouble with
their memory shortly after a procedure,

158
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,445
and that also improves with time.

159
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:25,270
Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunction is
something that can occur several days to

160
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,290
weeks after a patient undergoes a
procedure.

161
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,940
And it's important to keep this in mind if
a patient starts reporting some new

162
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,900
symptoms related to their mental health.

163
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,480
Immediately after a, a surgical procedure
and

164
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,380
the time thereabout after that procedure.

165
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,880
Also keep in mind that Post-Operative
Cognitive Dysfunction and

166
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,060
the risk of this is, is not decreased by
the use of regional anesthetic techniques.

167
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,270
So while regional anesthetic techniques
maybe,

168
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:57,940
may be useful to decrease the risk of a
patient having postoperative delirium.

169
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,750
It does not have the it is not possible
for

170
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,865
regional techniques, at least according to
current research, to decrease the risk of

171
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,910
post-operative cognitive dysfunction in
geriatric patients.

172
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,940
Let's continue our discussion with the
topic of the,

173
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,240
a patient's cardiovascular system and how
that changes as, as a patient ages.

174
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,550
Some of the changes that commonly occur in
geriatric patients include things like

175
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,600
decreased elasticity of the great vessels,
and the arterials.

176
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,020
There's also an increased risk of ple, of
the presence of atherosclerotic plaques.

177
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,850
And there are altered cardiac dynamics
that are important to

178
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,480
understand as a result of the previous two
conditions.

179
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,590
Or just due to a patients aging myocardium
and myocardial structure.

180
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,930
Comorbidities are particularly common
related to the cardiovascular system.

181
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,370
And these should be of particular interest
to the anesthesiologist,

182
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,450
since Anesthesiology is often referred to,
as the practice of autonomic medicine.

183
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,130
And the cardiovascular system is
particularly sensitive to changes in

184
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,260
autonomic physiology.

185
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,930
Patients may have comorbidity such as,
hypertension that's been long standing or

186
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,910
poorly treated over a long period of time.

187
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,960
They may have coronary artery disease or
have undergone previous cardiac surgery,

188
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,000
which may affect your anesthetic
management or anesthetic plan.

189
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,930
In addition they may have cerebral
vascular disease or

190
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,620
peripheral vascular disease that may it,
raise your suspicion for cardiac

191
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,060
disease or coronary artery disease, that
may not have been diagnosed in a patient.

192
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,450
Patients who are older also have an
increased risk of valvular disease such as

193
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,900
aortic stenosis, or other, or mitral
stenosis.

194
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,980
These things may occur more commonly in
geriatric patients than in

195
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,380
their younger counterparts.

196
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,700
And may be undiagnosed prior to your
physical examination in

197
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,860
the preoperative setting with that
patient.

198
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,270
Also, keep in mind that if a patient has
cardiovascular disease.

199
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,970
They may have an impaired ability to
exercise.

200
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,040
Which indicates an overall decrease in
functional reserve,

201
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,200
as we discussed earlier.

202
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,310
As patients age, there's also a decreased
response decreased responsiveness of

203
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:12,170
beta receptors, beta adrenergic receptors
too sympathetic stimuli.

204
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,860
As a result, the central nervous system in
geriatric patients tends to increase

205
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,000
the output of sympathetic tone in order to
cause the, cause

206
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,610
the same amount of increased beta response
in that an organ, in this case the heart.

207
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:35,190
So, as patients age there's a decreased
level or decreased sensitivity to beta

208
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:41,640
receptor stimuli to beta, beta adrenergic
stimuli.

209
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,220
And geriatric patients, as a result, are
commonly in a, in a what's described as

210
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,730
a constantly or chronically
sympathetically stimulated state.

211
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,650
In addition, diastolic dysfunction is
particularly common

212
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,430
amongst geriatric patients.

213
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,560
We'll discuss that next.

214
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,510
It is particularly important to

215
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:06,020
keep Cardiac Diastolic Dysfunction in mind
when working with geriatric patients.

216
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,780
Diastolic dysfunction is more common
amongst geriatric patients than

217
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,200
amongst their younger peers.

218
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,110
With diastolic dysfunction, there is an
abnormality of left ventricular filling,

219
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,628
as a result of a change in the timing of
diastole and

220
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,470
systole, in the cardiac cycle.

221
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,140
When working with, when reviewing the
cardiac cycle,

222
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:33,590
there's normally a extended period of
diastole.

223
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,090
During which the left ventricle relaxes
and

224
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,910
the left atrium provides some contribution
to filling.

225
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,690
When there is severe or moderate diastolic
dysfunction.

226
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:50,750
It's, there's a shortening of diastole in
the heart, and during the cardiac cycle,

227
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,880
and a prolongation of cystally, in the
cardiac cycle.

228
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,320
As a result, there's less time for

229
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,420
left ventricular relaxation, and less time
for filling of the left ventricle.

230
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,820
As a result, the left atrium must make a
greater contribution to

231
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,770
left ventricular filling.

232
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:13,310
And, if there's left atrial pathology or
dysrhythmia, there can be a,

233
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:18,980
this can lead to severe symptoms or
changes in a patient's physiology.

234
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,150
As they may not be able to tolerate this
change in cardiac output well.

235
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,290
Keep in mind that this is more, diastolic
dysfunction is

236
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,310
more common amongst geriatric patients
than amongst younger patients.

237
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,110
In fact in a review of patients who are 50
years and

238
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,160
younger who have some form of heart
failure,

239
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,550
only 15% of them have heart failure as a
result of diastolic dysfunction.

240
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,890
The vast majority are affected by some
form of systolic cardiac dysfunction.

241
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,120
However, when considering patients who are
70 years old, or older,

242
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,740
who have heart failure, over 70% of them,
have cardiac diastolic dysfunction,

243
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,210
that's directly contributing to their
heart failure.

244
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:08,020
This diastolic dysfunction lies on a
spectrum, keep in mind some patients may

245
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,540
not have any symptoms or may have very
mild symptoms that

246
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,210
they don't feel comfortable or that there
necessary to report to their doctor.

247
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,428
Diastolic Dysfunction may become worse in
the perioperative period due to

248
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:26,500
arrhythmias or dysrhythmias, or other
problems related to cardiac volume status.

249
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,610
Keep in mind the left atrium is having to
contribute more to the cardiac out,

250
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,520
to left ventricular filling and therefore
to cardiac output.

251
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,930
So anything that affects the rhythm of the
heart, or

252
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,639
left atrial function, may make diastolic
dysfunction worse.

253
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,890
Since patients are often undiagnosed or

254
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,550
asymptomatic who have diastolic
dysfunction, it's important for

255
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,110
you, as the anesthesiologist to keep this
in mind when assessing the patient.

256
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,380
Even if they don't have symptoms or any
other sort of

257
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,488
marker that would lead you to think that
they have diastolic dysfunction.

258
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:05,560
This may affect your anesthetic plan as
well, if you diagnose a patient with this,

259
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,430
or you know they have diastolic cardiac
dysfunction.

260
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,890
The, the hypothesis for why patients are
elderly or

261
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:19,020
geriatric, more commonly have diastolic
cardiac dysfunction, is that a,

262
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:25,400
a patient of that age group tends to have
less elastic great vessels and arterioles.

263
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:33,141
As a result of this decreased elasticity,
there's a decrease in the pressure transf,

264
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:39,390
transference by those vessels to the end
organ with each beat of the heart.

265
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,820
As the heart beats, much of the pressure
of cardiac, systole,

266
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:50,120
goes into causing a expansion in the great
vessels, based on their elasticity.

267
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,340
And tr, those vessels then, transfer that
pressure downstream to

268
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,099
the end organs and other tissues that are
perfused by the cardiac circulation.

269
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,040
As the vessels age, there is less of that
elasticity in the great vessels and

270
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:11,760
the arterioles, and as a result, the
myocardium must eject or

271
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,250
must contract for a longer period of time,
in order for

272
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:20,450
the same pressure wave to reach the end
organs and stay at those end organs.

273
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,810
To profuse them through the small
capillaries and small vessels that

274
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:28,260
are there which tend to be higher
resistance than the larger vessels.

275
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,289
In, in order to profuse those areas, that
cardiac systole or

276
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:34,100
ejection must be maintained for a longer
period of time.

277
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,230
Since that is occurring, the cardiac cycle
is in effect altered.

278
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,760
And as a result, systole is lengthened.

279
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,240
And diastole is shortened.

280
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,420
With less filling time available,

281
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,940
the left ventricle requires to a greater
degree on left atrium activity in

282
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,110
order to fill the left ventricle during
that shortened diastolic period.

283
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,980
If patients already have some difficulty
with profusion, or

284
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,510
difficulty with end organ disease.

285
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,800
Any interference in cardiac output, as a
result of arrhythmia, or dysrhythmia, or

286
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,480
a left atrial dysfunction may result in
serious complications for the patient.

287
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,500
That's why this is so

288
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,300
important to keep in mind when working
with our geriatric patient population.

289
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,810
Next, we'll discuss some of the changes
that can occur with a patient's lungs and

290
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,200
pulmonary system.

291
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,430
When it comes to geriatric physiology and
aging.

292
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,180
Some of the changes that commonly occur
include things like

293
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,100
changes in lung volumes, and decreased
compliance of the lungs.

294
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,950
There's also a change in central responses
to hypoxemia, and hypercarbia.

295
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,270
Patients become less sensitive to these
stimuli, so

296
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,670
the hypercarbia may not induce a patient
to begin breathing at a same,

297
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:55,810
at the same level in an 80 year old as it
does in someone who's much younger.

298
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:01,020
In addition, hypoxemia may not result in a
drive to take a breath

299
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,380
in an elderly patient.

300
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,260
At the same level as it does in a younger
patient.

301
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,660
These are important to remember, since
we're working a great deal with

302
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:13,400
pulmonary physiology in the operating
room, when we're delivering anaesthetics.

303
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,080
In addition, closing capacity, which is
the capacity at which or

304
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:25,560
lung volume at which a patient's small
bronchioles close and small airways close

305
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:31,890
thereby causing transient atelectasis in
small airways and small alveoli.

306
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,540
That's the capacity at which that closing
occurs in distal airways.

307
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,590
So closing capacity increases as a patient
ages.

308
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:46,570
And that means that as we age the closing
capacity becomes much closer to and

309
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,650
eventually does exceed the functional
reserve capacity,

310
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,360
functional residual capacity of our lungs.

311
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:59,310
So patients who are over the age of 65 are
more likely to have chronic atelectasis in

312
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:04,340
the distal portions of their small airways
than patients who are under that age.

313
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,955
As a result, there's an increased
ventilation and

314
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:08,950
perfusion mismatch in these patients.

315
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,190
And that's important to remember since
they,

316
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,190
again, don't have the same functional
reserve as patients who,

317
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,780
don't have, who are younger, and don't
have such a high closing capacity.

318
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,210
This'll be illustrated on the next slide
with a graph that demonstrates where this,

319
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,820
overlap occurs.

320
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,440
Comorbidities are particularly common in
geriatric patients.

321
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,239
And they may include things like, COPD and
Atelectasis.

322
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,540
They may also be more prone to pleural
effusions as a result of

323
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,990
electrolyte disturbances or other changes
in their pulmonary physiology.

324
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,910
Keep in mind, geriatric patients have,
have a longer life span during which to

325
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,990
accumulate damage from nicotine or tobacco
exposure.

326
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,499
Or environmental or workplace hazards
which may lead to lung disease.

327
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,310
If we look at the pulmonary volumes of an
individual as they

328
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:04,380
age by enlarged, the biggest change to
notice is the closing capacity, and

329
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,750
how that changes as patients age.

330
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,070
Closing capacity eventually increases to
the point

331
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,950
at which functional residual can, it
exceeds functional residual capacity.

332
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,930
When that happens,

333
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:21,510
those small airways in the distal
pulmonary system are chronically closed.

334
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,500
And they only open with coughing or

335
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,780
with particular maneuvers that might
increase a patient's lung volumes temp,

336
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,180
temporarily until they have an opportunity
to close again.

337
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,676
When patients are just breathing at steady
state and

338
00:22:35,676 --> 00:22:39,570
on normal, on room air though, they may
chronically have

339
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:44,132
some atelectasis going on in the distal
segments of their airways.

340
00:22:44,132 --> 00:22:46,340
Lastly, let's talk about the Renal system
and

341
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,260
how a patient's kidneys may change with
aging.

342
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,470
Keep in mind as patients age there's a
decrease in renal mass of

343
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,280
approximately 30%.

344
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,220
Compared to with when patients were in the
prime of their lives, and

345
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,270
they're much younger.

346
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,080
There's also a decrease in the number of
functional glomeruli,

347
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,430
also of approximately 30% compared with
when patients are younger.

348
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,650
Decreased muscle mass decreases the amount
of

349
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,750
creatinine released into the bloodstream.

350
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,320
So, patients with renal dysfunction may
not present with an elevated creatinine.

351
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,480
Unlike patients who are younger and have
renal disease.

352
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,360
Without that muscle mass, there's not as
much creatine that needs to be cleared,

353
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,290
and the kidneys may be able to clear it
quite easily.

354
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,090
In which case,

355
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:30,190
your laboratory result may indicate that a
patient's kidneys are functioning fine.

356
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,320
For the muscle mass that they have.

357
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,470
But the kidneys may not behave in the same
way when working to metabolize or

358
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,440
clear a medication that you administer.

359
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,310
This is important because many of the
medications we administer in

360
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:48,210
anesthesia are, are cleared by the kidney
or metabolized by the kidney.

361
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:52,730
And their metabolization may be altered as
a result of this decrease in

362
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,860
renal mass and renal function.

363
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,240
There's also a change in a patient's
thirst center responses and

364
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,580
many geriatric patients have a decreased
drive to drink, and as a result,

365
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,910
they may be chronically dehydrated.

366
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,750
Keep this in mind as patients may come for
a procedure and

367
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,852
may be more dehydrated from being NPO or
nothing by mouth.

368
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,000
For the preoperative period,

369
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,330
as well as just not drinking as much water
prior to becoming NPO.

370
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:25,420
So, when patients present, they may be
already quite dehydrated and

371
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,870
may need additional fluids during the
procedure,

372
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,849
depending on what the planned procedure
and anesthetic are.

373
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,930
There are comorbidities that are more
common, amongst geriatric patients,

374
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:36,990
related to the kidneys.

375
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,250
These include things like con,

376
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,490
chronic kidney disease, which is often
undiagnosed.

377
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:46,300
In fact, in the Jour, American Journal of
Kidney Disease in 2010, a study was

378
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:53,230
performed, in which, a, extremely large
cohort of geriatric patients was assessed.

379
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,590
For the presence of renal disease.

380
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:01,220
They took one sample group and ran
standard tests on that sample group,

381
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,930
in order to determine how many actually
have renal disease,

382
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,510
that could be diagnosed by a physician.

383
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:12,110
Of all of the people that they tested,
over 7,000 who were selected at random,

384
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,480
they did not have any, comorbidities that
made them think they were more likely or

385
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,565
more less likely to have renal disease to
begin with.

386
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:24,630
44% had some form, or some degree, of
chronic kidney disease.

387
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:30,490
When they took a random sample of medicare
beneficiaries of the same age, age 65 and

388
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:35,610
older, they found that only 7% of medicare
beneficiaries in the, the group that

389
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:40,710
they sampled had some diagnosis of chronic
kidney disease or renal failure.

390
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,410
So there's a large portion of our
population,

391
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,700
our geriatric population that has
undiagnosed renal disease.

392
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,380
And they may be coming to us for
procedures and we're tricked, or

393
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,950
we don't understand necessarily that they
have this renal disease.

394
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,670
Because the creatinine or other lab values
that we see,

395
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,900
don't indicate that they have renal, renal
disease.

396
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,340
Because their muscle mass is less, and
they don't have as much creatine to clear.

397
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,100
So keep this in mind, when we're working
with our geriatric patients,

398
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,710
they may have undiagnosed renal disease.

399
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,280
In addition, chronic dehydration,

400
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,630
can be very important, especially in the
postoperative period.

401
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:21,770
Patients who are elderly may not have as
much as a drive for thirst, or

402
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,500
a drive to drink water as other patients.

403
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,080
And as a result it may be more difficult
to transition them from IV fluids in

404
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,390
the postoperative period, to a diet or a
full diet and discontinue those IV fluids.

405
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,800
Keep that in mind that the ins and outs
for geriatric patients need to be

406
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,410
monitored somewhat more closely than for
more robust patients.

407
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:46,610
In order to determine if they're consuming
enough water for their hydration needs.

408
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:49,090
Also keep in mind that renal diseases
often

409
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,160
renal disease often occurs simultaneously
with other diseases.

410
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:00,570
Hepatorenal system syndrome is one of the
better known

411
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:06,550
multiorgan diseases involving the kidneys,
but other ones do exist, as well.

412
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,780
Renal disease may actually be an indicator
or

413
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,860
a marker of another medical condition that
needs to be diagnosed and

414
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,299
treated in order to help the patient's
overall health.

415
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,950
To conclude I'd like to thank you for
watching this video.

416
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,240
And we hope that you found it useful in
raising some of

417
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,000
the important points about geriatric
physiology, that may not commonly be

418
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,550
covered prior to taking a geriatric
patient to the operating room.

419
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,980
Or for an anaesthetic outside the
operating room.

420
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,340
When geriatric patients come to your, your
hospital or your clinic, it's important to

421
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,180
remember that, in general, there's an
increase in variability amongst these

422
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,950
patients, both between patients and within
a single patient.

423
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,020
True age does not equal physiologic age,
and

424
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,090
physiologic age does not equal true age in
the vast majority of patients.

425
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:03,060
Some geriatric patients are particularly
robust and have

426
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:07,500
a great functional reserve while other
ones, have a minimal functional reserve.

427
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,890
And could be upset or

428
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,890
have severe complications as a result of
any type of physiologic stress.

429
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:16,720
Those two patients may be of the same true
age, but

430
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,880
their physiologic age may be very
different.

431
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,280
Within an individual the organs systems
may age differently or

432
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,290
have different diseases that result in the
appearance of differing ages of those

433
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:32,040
organs or different, differing functional
reserves of those organ systems.

434
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,080
Keep this in mind too,

435
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,950
when you're evaluating patients before
taking them for surgery.

436
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:41,800
Also keep in mind that when geriatric
patients present with a disease,

437
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,600
they are more common, they more commonly
present with an atypical presentation.

438
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,640
They may have differing signs and

439
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,270
symptoms than what you're used to seeing
in patients who are younger.

440
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,070
And you may need to think a little bit
more outside the box when

441
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,760
working with geriatric patients.

442
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,980
We hope that you found this useful and

443
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,490
specifically the parts about the various
organ systems.

444
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:07,940
We hope that you found that particularly
useful since geriatric patients are more

445
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,480
commonly affected by comorbidities that
may play a role

446
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,950
in your anesthetic management and
anesthetic planning for those patients.

447
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,650
Thank you again, and we'll see you next
time.
