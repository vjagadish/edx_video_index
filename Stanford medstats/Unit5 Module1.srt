00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,640
Welcome to our module on creating graphics
and SAS Enterprise Guide.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,240
As you're probably learning in your HRP
classes, data visualization is really

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,510
important when you're doing epidemiology
and clinical research.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,300
>> There may be times that patterns are
too difficult to

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,890
interpret simply by looking at the numbers
in a table.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,709
In situations like this, graphics can
become extremely essential.

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,320
>> That being said, there are important
differences between good and bad graphics.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,020
Graphics can be really helpful if they
highlight the key points,

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,300
if they're clearly labeled and they don't
contain unnecessary information.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,230
>> Generally, make sure your graphics
related to your conclusions and

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,339
inferences made in the study.

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,170
Overall, bad graphics consist of pie
charts.

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,820
>> Anything that's 3D or too much ink.

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,020
>> Anything shaped like a donut, and
graphs that are stacked.

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,860
>> Here's a 3D exploding pie chart.

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,020
This is a pretty bad graphic for a lot of
reasons.

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,030
First of all it's 3D, so the first
perspective can make it hard to

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,360
tell the difference between stuff in the
foreground versus the background.

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,010
In general, graphs like these take up way
too much ink and

20
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,520
it's hard to tell what they're trying to
convey.

21
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,870
Avoid using 3D bar charts like these,

22
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,160
because again the 3D perspective can make
it hard to tell.

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,260
Where does the line go?

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,350
Is it based on the front of the bar or the
back of the bar?

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,730
>> Donuts are similar to pie charts.

26
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,535
They do not give you a lot of information
and they take up a lot of ink.

27
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,220
>> Stacking is really bad because it's
hard to tell the relative size of

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,500
the stacked bars, because they don't have
the same baseline.

29
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,750
These graphs combine all the worst
features of the ones we showed you so far.

30
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,160
They're 3D, they're stacked, and they're
using pie charts.

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,400
It's really hard to interpret what's going
on and it can be really misleading, and

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,660
it's not very clear what they're trying to
convey with this kind of graphic.

33
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,060
>> As Dr. Ray Belise said, if you get a
glossy handout with a 3D pie chart,

34
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,379
assume someone is lying to you.

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,080
SASS enterprise has many procedures for

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,220
graphing we will be using PROC SG plot and
proc G plot.

37
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,030
>> There are endless changes that can be
made to graphics an entire course can be

38
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,700
dedicated to SASS syntax for graphics.

39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,880
In the following modules we're going to
show you the basic code for

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,790
the essential graphics and once we're done
with this we'll let you out on

41
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,430
your own to work with a SASS
documentation.
