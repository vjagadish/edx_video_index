00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,710
For those of you who want a few more
mathematical details about

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,090
the relationship between the odds ratio
and

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,700
the risk ratio, it's pretty easy to show
the mathematical relationship.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,925
So I'm going to do that now.

5
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:22,560
So if we wrote out the risk ratio, I'm
going to use a few symbols here.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,370
So if we say that the risk ratio is equal
to the probability of

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,900
getting the disease and some exposed
group, I'll call that P exposed.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,340
So that's like my smoking group.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,480
That's the probability of getting the
disease in, say, my smoking group.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,830
And then my risk ratio compares that group
to some reference groups.

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,200
So that's what the probability of getting
the disease in the reference group.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,770
We'll call that P ref.

13
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,162
That's what our risk ratio is.

14
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:51,432
If we wrote off the odds ratio in term of,
in terms of P exposed and

15
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:56,650
P ref, the odds ratio is equal to the
probability of

16
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,680
getting the disease in the exposed divided
by one minus that probability.

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,140
That's the odds for the exposed group.

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,890
And then, we have to divide that by the
odds for the reference group.

19
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:14,541
So, that would be P-ref, divided by 1
minus P-ref.

20
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:19,830
So then if we wanted to make a formula
that

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,130
showed us the relationship between the
odds ratio and the risk ratio,

22
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,980
we could simply say, well what's different
between the odds ratio and the risk ratio?

23
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,750
Well the risk ratio is the probability in

24
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,170
the exposed group divided by the
probability in the reference group.

25
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:40,470
So the odds ratio is simply the risk ratio
times a factor and that factor is 1

26
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,480
minus the probability of the getting the
disease in the reference group,

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:51,430
divided 1 minus the probability of getting
the disease in the exposed group.

28
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,490
So that's the relationship between the
odds ratio and the risk ratio.

29
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,410
What you notice is that the odds ratio is
always the risk ratio times this

30
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,540
additional factor, this what I call a
distortion term.

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,780
If the outcome is rare, that means P ref
is small and also P exposed is small.

32
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,350
So for example, let's say that P exposed
is 2%.

33
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,470
So the exposure the probability of getting
a disease in the, say,

34
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,310
the smoking group is 2% and in the
reference group, it's 1%.

35
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,695
Those are fairly rare outcomes.

36
00:02:23,695 --> 00:02:28,820
Well, if the probability of getting the
disease is 2% then,

37
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,370
the probability of not getting it is 98%.

38
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,540
If the probability of getting the disease
is 1%,

39
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,360
then the probability of not getting it is
99%.

40
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,944
So in that case, this distortion term,

41
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:46,650
1 minus P ref divided by 1 minus P exp,

42
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,130
exposed would just be 99% divided by 98%.

43
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,560
That would be the distortion term.

44
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,220
Well that's awfully close to 1.

45
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,560
So if that's the case, if you have
something that's rare the distortion term,

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,995
what you're multiplying the risk ratio by
to get the odds ratio is extremely small.

47
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:08,980
But compare that now to the situation
where the the [INAUDIBLE],

48
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,710
the, the risk of getting your outcome is
actually much higher.

49
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,610
So compared to this situation where, say,

50
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:23,340
the risk of getting the outcome in the
exposed group is 50%.

51
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,960
And the risk in the reference group is
25%.

52
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,580
Those are common outcomes.

53
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,870
So now the risk of not getting the, the
outcome in the expose group is 50% and

54
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,890
the chance of not getting it in the
reference group is 75%.

55
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,750
So now, what's our distortion factor, 1
minus P ref divided by 1 minus P exposed,

56
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,470
that distortion factor is now going to be
75% divided by 50% or 1.5.

57
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,460
So our, our odds ratio now will be 1.5
times the risk ratio.

58
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,726
If we have risk ratios that are below 1,
that if,

59
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:58,300
as if we're dealing with protective
effects,

60
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,740
what will happen is that this distortion
term will be a fraction.

61
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,590
And so the odds ratio will always be
smaller than the corresponding risk ratio.

62
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,620
That means that the, the protective effect
will look larger.

63
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,120
