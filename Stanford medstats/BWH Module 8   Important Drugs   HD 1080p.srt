2
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:26,379
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Larry Chu.

3
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:28,039
>> And I'm Dr. Ren Weidman.

4
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:28,560
>> On this segment, we're only going to
talk about two things.

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,010
But they're pretty important things,
aren't they, Ren?

6
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,900
>> They are.

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,790
So, in the Cardiac ORU, you'll be
introduced to a bunch of new medications.

8
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,030
The two most important medications, in our
opinion, are heparin and protamine.

9
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,250
The reason is, is because the improper use
of heparin and

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,580
protamine can result in catastrophic,
situations.

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,110
>> Oh my gosh.
Well,

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,900
I'm really interested in knowing, more
about these drugs.

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,450
Let's get started.

14
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,970
>> Okay.
Hi, this is Ren Weidman.

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,119
We're going to talk a little bit about
heparin and protamine, and

16
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,826
their role in the cardiac operating room.

17
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:04,836
So the vast majority of cardiac surgery,

18
00:01:04,836 --> 00:01:07,370
requires the use of the cardiopulmonary
bypass machine.

19
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,458
The bypass machine contains non-biological
material.

20
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:14,009
And when the patient's blood is exposed to
this material,

21
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,050
it can result in the activation of a
clotting cascade.

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,040
For this reason, patients are usually
given an anticoagulant prior to

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,670
going under the cardiopulmonary bypass
machine.

24
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,560
More often than not, the anticoagulant of
choice is heparin.

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,220
Heparin has been around since the
inception of

26
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,390
the cardiopulmonary bypass machine and as
such is a tried and tested method.

27
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,310
It also has the, added benefit of being a
drug which is reversible.

28
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,242
Heparin acts on antithrombin III.

29
00:01:40,242 --> 00:01:44,404
Antithrombin III binds and inhibits
thrombin.

30
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:49,357
And when heparin is in the bloodstream, it
augments the activity of antithrombin III

31
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:54,130
by about 1,000 fold, and thus results in
the anti-coagulated state.

32
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,352
Heparin is prepared in vials of 1,000
U/ml.

33
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:58,608
The textbook dosage of heparin required
for

34
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:03,629
the cardiopulmonary bypass machine, is
about 350 U/kg.

35
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,130
There are, machines that exist,

36
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,580
that can take a unit of patient's blood,
and can predict the appropriate amount

37
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,390
of heparin to achieve a desired level of
anti-coagulation.

38
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,050
But without those machines, usually using
the,

39
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:24,040
the standard dosage of 350 U/kg, is what,
what people do.

40
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,120
Now the timing of the administration of
heparin is also important.

41
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,965
It should be given just prior to
cannulation.

42
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:37,440
You obviously want to have the patient's
blood, anti-coagulated before

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,330
the cannula are introduced as the cannula
can results in, activation of coagulation.

44
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,140
But you don't want to give it too early,
as you don't want to thin the patient's

45
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,080
blood when it's unnecessary, as this can
result in excess bleeding.

46
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,510
Once the heparin has been given, you
want to test its effectiveness.

47
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,080
The effectiveness of heparin is tested by,

48
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,720
a test called the activated clotting time
or the ACT.

49
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,790
In this test, a small amount of patient's
blood is exposed to an activator,

50
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,654
usually clay or dirt.

51
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:09,784
And then the time to clotting is, is
recorded.

52
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:13,898
The goal here at the Brigham Women
Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital,

53
00:03:13,898 --> 00:03:18,410
is an ACT of greater than 350 seconds
prior to going on to the bypass machine.

54
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,410
At other institutions, this score may
vary, but some institutions requiring

55
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:29,848
an ACT as high as 480 seconds before the
initiate, initiation of bypass.

56
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:31,890
And the dose of heparin to,

57
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:38,665
to achieve this, this target ACT, varies
from patient to patient.

58
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:40,710
Once cardiopulmonary bypass has started,

59
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,836
it's necessary to recheck the ACT on
occasion.

60
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:48,597
In order to maintain an appropriate level,
of anti-coagulation.

61
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:52,240
The half-life of heparin is, is about 60
to 90 minutes.

62
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,050
And usually the profusion is for recheck
the ACT, every 20 to 30 minutes.

63
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,934
And then give heparin as needed to again
maintain, a target ACT.

64
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,640
A couple final thoughts about heparin.

65
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,541
It's usually administered through a
central line to assure its,

66
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,010
its administration into the, into the
blood stream.

67
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,380
And one should also be aware of the
potential hypotension that

68
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,590
can result from the administration of
heparin.

69
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,820
If hypotension occurs,

70
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,326
it usually occurs over a period of about 5
to 10 minutes in a gradual fashion.

71
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:25,508
finally, being aware of whether or

72
00:04:25,508 --> 00:04:30,350
not your patient has heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia or HIT is important.

73
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,900
If you patient does have HIT, it's
important to discuss with your attending,

74
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,510
with the perfusionist, what the
anti-coagulation strategy is,

75
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,490
as you most likely will not be giving the
patient heparin.

76
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,570
So now let's move our discussion on
protamine.

77
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,790
Protamine is, acts on heparin to reverse
its anti-coagulant activity.

78
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,470
It binds the heparin molecule and it
neutralizes it.

79
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,160
And the ability of protamine to reverse
heparin is one of the main reasons why

80
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,184
heparin is the preferred anticoagulant,
for cardiopulmonary bypass.

81
00:05:02,184 --> 00:05:06,320
As it does reverse the anti-coagulation in
the blood,

82
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,754
it is also considered one of the most
dangerous drugs in cardiac surgery because

83
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:17,360
improper administration, of protamine can
have catastrophic results.

84
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,470
Protamine is prepared in vials with
concentrations of about 10 mg/ml.

85
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,180
And the text of dosage of protamine for
the reversal of heparin is 1 milligram of

86
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,330
protamine for every hundred units of
heparin.

87
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,270
And, again, the timing of the
administration, is critical.

88
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,270
The improper administration of protamine
before the appropriate time,

89
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,600
can be a catastrophic mistake and can
often result in the patient's death.

90
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,030
So let's start this slide over.

91
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,240
If protamine is administered before the
appropriate time,

92
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,460
the results can be catastrophic and can
very easily result in a patient's death.

93
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,270
Protamine should not be administered
before the patient is

94
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,033
off the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

95
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:07,740
You can imagine what would happen if the
patient was given protamine while he or

96
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,851
she was still on the bypass machine.

97
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:13,076
The, the anticoagulant effect of heparin
would be reverse.

98
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:15,860
A clot would form which would damage the
ability of the cardiopulmonary bypass

99
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,150
machine to oxygenate the blood and to flow
the blood into the body.

100
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,010
It can also result in embolic phenomenon
with thrombus going to

101
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,718
vital organs such as the brain or the
kidneys.

102
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:31,740
As the result prior to the administration
of heparin, the surgeon,

103
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,660
the profusionist, and the attending
anesthesiologist should all

104
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,550
verbally agree that it is the appropriate
time to give protamine.

105
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,240
And each of these individuals has, has
separate items that they are considering

106
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,710
regarding whether or not it's appropriate
to reverse the protamine.

107
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,030
And therefore reverse the ability to go
back onto

108
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,040
the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.

109
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,634
Protamine in and of itself can also cause
some adverse reactions.

110
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:05,400
With the rapid administration of
protamine, you can cause hypotension.

111
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,300
For this reason, protamine should be given
in small boluses over time.

112
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,460
Protamine can also cause an anaphylactiod
or

113
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:17,680
an anaphylactic reaction with the expected
hypotension, vasodilation, flushing,

114
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,350
and bronchospasm that are often seen with
anaphylaxis.

115
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,720
Additionally, you can get a catastrophic
pulmonary vasoconstriction as

116
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,540
an reaction of protamine.

117
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:34,540
And this is, this occurs through a
thromboxane-mediated mechanism.

118
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,000
For this reason, the way we administer
protamine is, is very specific.

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,610
We initially give a test dose of 1
milliliter or 10 milligrams.

120
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,020
And wait two or three minutes to see if
the blood pressure drops or

121
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,830
if the CBP rises, as it would in, in, in
conditions of anaphylaxis and

122
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,190
catastrophic pulmonary vassal
constriction, respectively.

123
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:55,880
If the test dose is negative,

124
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,738
the anesthesiologist will announce going
to 50%, meaning 50% of the protamine.

125
00:08:00,738 --> 00:08:01,720
He or

126
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,650
she then administers half of protamine
dose in a slow controlled fashion.

127
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,990
And as long as everything is good and as
long as the profusionist and the surgeon

128
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,490
are okay with it, the anesthesiologist
will then announce going to a 100%.

129
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,760
Once the anesthesiologist has
administered, all of the protamine dose,

130
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,580
he or she announces to the room that the
protamine is at 100%.

131
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,334
The key to all of this is closed-loop
communication, as the profusionist,

132
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:34,460
the anesthesiologist, and the surgeon, all
have very important factors to consider.

133
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,440
There definitely needs to be,
communication back and

134
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,260
forth between all three parties.

135
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:48,762
And the lack of this sort of closed-loop
communication and

136
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:53,313
mutual understanding of where we are in,

137
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:58,774
in terms of our active coagulation can
have,

138
00:08:58,774 --> 00:09:05,088
very severe, very permanent adverse
reactions.

139
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:06,387
But if communication is kept open, then
heparin and

140
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:07,430
protamine can be used in a very safe
[INAUDIBLE].

141
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,160
>> Well, another great talk.

142
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,660
Thank you so much, learned a lot about
protamine and heparin.

143
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,710
Now, one of the things I want to ask you,
now that we know, the, the,

144
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,530
really severe implications of, of,

145
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,890
incorrectly dosing these drugs, do you
have any tips for me on how,

146
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,170
practical tips on how we can try to
prevent those things from happening?

147
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,520
>> It's a good question.

148
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,706
as, as, one might imagine, a,

149
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:34,500
a syringe swap in this situation can again
be catastrophic,

150
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,670
and, and, methods that are employed to
prevent that are, are always welcome.

151
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:45,220
And our specific institution, we keep the
protamine away, on the other side of

152
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,130
the room from the anesthesia area with, no
anesthesia carts containing any protamine.

153
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,570
So the time that protamine is to be
administered, the anesthesiologist

154
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,130
actually has to cross the room and pick it
up from the nurse and then come back.

155
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,930
And that's just again to be safe and

156
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,820
be sure that protamine is not administered
at an inappropriate time.

157
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,880
>> Well that's actually a great tip,

158
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,570
and what I want to do next is just to
summarize what we learn in a segment.

159
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,590
Of course, we learned that heparin is used
as an anticoagulant because we put our

160
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,320
patients in cardiopulmonary bypass, and

161
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,010
we want to make sure that the blood
doesn't clot in the pump, of course.

162
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,540
And that involves administering a dose of
heparin and,

163
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,840
your, institution has methods for
calculating what that dose is and

164
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,000
administer it according to what you've
already agreed to with your attending.

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,900
The important, and

166
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,710
you want to do that before you put your
patient on bypass, of course.

167
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:43,670
And you also want to confirm the efficacy
of the drug that you administer,

168
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:48,340
through an ACT, and finally protocols of
your institution so that

169
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,710
you know that the heparin has taken effect
before you put your patient on bypass.

170
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,700
Now of course, we know that protamine
reverses the effects of heparin, so

171
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,370
we don't want to give that drug until
after the patient's off of bypass.

172
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,170
So that's an important timing issue.

173
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,250
And also, we want to administer the
correct dose.

174
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,450
And again, each institution has methods
for,

175
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,960
for calculating the correct dose of how
pro, protamine.

176
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,270
And you should follow those at your
institution.

177
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,680
Ren gave us some great tips about how to
avoid syringe swaps.

178
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,940
And of course, closed-loop communication
is also very important with protamine.

179
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,180
We want to make sure that everyone in the
room has a shared mental model about

180
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,500
what's going to happen, so that we're
confirming that the protamine is being

181
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,079
administered at the correct time and the
correct dose for the patient.

182
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,460
And finally, we talked about,

183
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,230
severe adverse reactions that can occur
with administration of protamine.

184
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,746
Right?
Well, I

185
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:48,701
think we learned a lot about these two
drugs and

186
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:52,320
I think you'll be better prepared when you
start your cardiac anesthesia rotation.

187
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,357
We'll see you next time

188
00:11:53,357 --> 00:12:03,357
