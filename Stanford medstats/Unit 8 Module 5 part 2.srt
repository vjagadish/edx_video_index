1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,707
Again, why is this useful?

2
00:00:01,707 --> 00:00:03,070
We're just getting back out the means.

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,674
It doesn't seem all that interesting, but
because it's useful because we can then

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:10,013
throw other things into the multi-variable
regression model to adjust for

5
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:15,070
that, those covariance and confounders or
to get better predictions.

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,138
For example, let's say I was to throw age
into the model to try to

7
00:00:18,138 --> 00:00:22,480
get age-adjusted means for each of those
vitamin D groups.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,670
Age being a potential confounder here.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,689
So to adjust for age, I'm just going to
throw age into the model.

10
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:27,729
Nothing tricky.

11
00:00:27,729 --> 00:00:31,729
And here's the model that comes out when I
add age to the model.

12
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:35,694
So it's showing me that again, the normal
group is the reference group, so

13
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:38,849
it doesn't get a beta coefficient.

14
00:00:38,849 --> 00:00:43,820
Now I get an effect for age, and now I get
what are age-adjusted beta coefficients.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,280
These have now been adjusted for age.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,142
Interestingly, these are made up data, and
so

17
00:00:47,142 --> 00:00:50,082
in the process of making up the data, I
built in something a little funny,

18
00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:52,483
which is that the deficient group after
you adjust for age,

19
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:58,150
actually looks like it has more, a higher
cognitive score than the normal group.

20
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,040
So once, maybe that group was totally full
of much older people.

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,000
And once you account for

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,456
the fact that they're much older, then
their, their deficient their deficiency of

23
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:10,520
vitamin D is actually associated with a
greater DSST score.

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,079
That's a quirk, I think, of the fact that
I made up the data a certain way.

25
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,110
So that's the final model.

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,119
But what's great about this, is now I can
report age-adjusted means for

27
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,492
those groups.

28
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:21,962
And this is just showing the picture here.

29
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:25,826
Again, this is showing the slopes in each
of the three groups, for the relationship

30
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:31,432
between age and DSST scores here, so that
you can see that in all three groups.

31
00:01:31,432 --> 00:01:34,407
Certainly age is when we built this in,

32
00:01:34,407 --> 00:01:38,402
in the model, this is just kind of showing
you the model, so

33
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:46,325
age, as age goes up, you go down in your
cognitive function, for sure.

34
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:48,722
Interestingly, as I mentioned, though,
once you account for

35
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:51,824
age, the deficient group, that's this blue
line, actually seems to, across all

36
00:01:51,824 --> 00:01:56,450
different ages, have a little bit higher
of a, of a, of a cognitive score.

37
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,320
Might be a quirk of my made up data.

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,450
And I can calculate these age-adjusted
means.

39
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,411
The easiest way to calculate the
age-adjusted means is just to imagine that

40
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:07,300
everybody has the same age.

41
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,460
You have to pick an age to plug into the
model, so let's say,

42
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,820
let's plug in the mean age for the whole
data set, which was here, 55 years old.

43
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,924
So I can get the expected average DSST
value for a vitamin deficient,

44
00:02:17,924 --> 00:02:24,230
D deficient person who's 55 years old by
plugging all that into the model.

45
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,782
So we can just plug in this model to find
out the expected DSST score for

46
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:29,920
somebody who's vitamin D deficient and is
55 years old.

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,370
So we're fixing age so that age is the
same across these three groups.

48
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,350
That person has an expected score of 36.

49
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,310
Somebody who is insufficient who's at 55
years old based on this model is

50
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,830
predicted to have a DSST score of 29.1.

51
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,992
And for the normal group, a 55 year old is
actually predicted to be lower and

52
00:02:47,992 --> 00:02:50,100
a have a DSST score 27.7.

53
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,300
Again, probably a quirk of my made-up
data.

54
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,100
But it's nice to have these age-adjusted
means,

55
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,935
because you can then report the unadjusted
means and the age-adjusted means, so

56
00:02:56,935 --> 00:02:58,960
you can see it totally flipped the
relationship here,

57
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,585
once we accounted for age.

58
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:04,520
And that might be something funny in my
made-up data.
