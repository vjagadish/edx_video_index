1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,980
I just want to quickly point out that the
partial likelihood, when I was

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,130
describing that partial likelihood for
you, I didn't say what you did about ties.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,070
So every term in the likelihood, I said
you get the person who died or

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,480
had the event in the numerator and the
risk set in the denominator, but

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,790
what if more than one person had the event
at a particular time, say time equals one.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,000
So in the pregnancy data, for example, we
had several women getting pregnant in

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,520
the first month of their first cycle,
essentially, of the study.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,370
The partial likelihood actually assumes no
tied values amongst

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,080
the observed survival times, and that is
not often the case with real data.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,040
In other words, with real data, like the
pregnancy data, you'll often see ties.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,060
A lot of times the reason you have ties is
not because people had the event at

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,050
the exact same moment in time, which is
very unlikely.

13
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,810
But because, when we do a study, we don't
measure time very precisely.

14
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,610
So you might only know the month when
people had an event,

15
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,880
when a person had an event.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,330
So several people might have the event
three months into the study,

17
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,500
because that's as fine as you've measured
time.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,290
And that's usually what we assume.

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,120
We assume that the ties result from, that
the ties in your data set, that is,

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,630
having multiple people with the same event
time in your data set,

21
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,740
we usually assume that that just results
from the imprecise measurement of time.

22
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,220
So, in other words, we think if we, there
is some true order of

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,850
events that people don't die at the exact,
exact moment, but that if you

24
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,630
could measure time more finely you would
be able to know exactly who died first or

25
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,390
had the event first, so there is some true
order of events, we just don't know it.

26
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,500
And so, if you assume that, then you can
calculate the partial likelihood.

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,420
You can deal with the ties based on
something called an exact method.

28
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,070
And the exact method, as all exact methods
we've seen,

29
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,190
it calculates the exact probability of all
possible orderings of events.

30
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,030
So, in other words we said that they're,
if five people all have these

31
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,030
same event time in your data set, you can
calculate the probability that, you know,

32
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,340
the order was one, two, three, four, five,
if we call them subjects one through five.

33
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,580
Or that it was five, four,

34
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:12,070
three, two, one or all possible five
factorial possible orderings.

35
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,370
You could calculate the probabilities of
all of those.

36
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,460
Now this can be very calculation
intensive, as you can imagine,

37
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,015
especially if you have a lot of ties.

38
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,230
because it's literally calculating all the
possible ways it could have happened.

39
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,540
So since the exact method, especially in
the past, it's so

40
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,676
computationally intensive.

41
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:32,646
Back in the 70s, when we didn't have as
much computing power,

42
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:35,310
people came up with approximations to the
exact methods.

43
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,782
They went, rather than doing out this
exact probability, which can be,

44
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:40,742
if there a huge data set with lots of
ties,

45
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:44,840
which might hang your computer, there are
available approximations to it.

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,880
Bres, the Breslow approximation and

47
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,710
the Efron approximation are most commonly
used.

48
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,590
And I'm not going to go into the
mathematical details, but

49
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,000
they're just trying to do the exact method
without having so much computation.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,450
kind of getting at it without being
totally exact.

51
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,160
So, the Breslow approximation is actually
the default in SASS although,

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,920
statisticians will generally tell you that
the Efron approximation is

53
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,950
better in some situations.

54
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,170
In fact, if you take some real data and
try all of these different methods for

55
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,750
dealing with ties, even if you have a lot
of ties,

56
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,840
a lot of times it doesn't make a huge
difference in the estimate.

57
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,720
The only place that it really makes a
difference is if time is

58
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,080
actually not continuous, but time is
actually truly discrete.

59
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,160
And so one other way to handle the ties is
to, is called the discrete method, and

60
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,080
this is actually conceptually different,
because this is,

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,580
you might choose the discrete method when
time actually is truly discrete.

62
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,590
In other words, when the ties are real,
and

63
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,563
people actually have the event at the
exact same times.

64
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:49,670
And the way that might happen is if events
can only happen at certain discrete times.

65
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,890
So if time is truly discrete, you know,
the events are somehow periodic and

66
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,270
can only happen at certain times.

67
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,630
So maybe like winning an Olympic medal can
only happen every four years or voting for

68
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,690
President can only happen every four
years.

69
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,570
There's just some things that can only
happen at a given time.

70
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,433
Those ties are then real, and so

71
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:11,350
the method for handling with the ties then
is somewhat different.

72
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,580
Now, the discrete method actually does
something a little bit different.

73
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,070
So if you choose the discrete method for

74
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,170
handling ties, you're actually modeling
proportional odds.

75
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:24,350
And what you get out at the end of the day
are odds ratios, and not hazard ratios.

76
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,310
So that's a key distinction,

77
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,550
you have to know that those effects that
you're getting out are then odds ratios.

78
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,300
And just briefly, I don't want to go into
a lot of detail here, but briefly how it

79
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,800
works is, if, for example, you have a
hundred people at risk at a certain time

80
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,930
and 15 have the event at the exact same
time, what we're going to model

81
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,000
therefore is, what's the chance that, that
given that we know, condition that we

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,240
know that 15 events occurred, what's the
probability that the events happened to

83
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,880
this particular set of 15 people, out of
all possible sets of 15?

84
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,970
So in your denominator,

85
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,020
you are going to sort of have all possible
sets of 15 that could have happened.

86
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,914
You are going to have the probabilities
for all of those, and there are 100,

87
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:10,710
choose 15 of them if you have a hundred
people at risk.

88
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,246
And then you'll put in the numerator, the
probability for this specific 15,

89
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:20,610
the ones who actually did have the event
at that time, the actual set of 15.

90
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,760
So you're going to have a conditional
probability in your likelihood that

91
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,390
looks like that.

92
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,040
This does give you, because we've taken
out time now,

93
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,400
we're just saying groups of people, what
group of people had the events,

94
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,680
this does now go back to odds ratios,
rather than hazard ratios.

95
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,406
And if you think about it, if you remember
back to when we talked about conditional

96
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:42,078
logistic regression, the likelihood here
is actually very similar to the one we

97
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:45,780
had for conditional logistic regression,
which also gave you odds ratios.
