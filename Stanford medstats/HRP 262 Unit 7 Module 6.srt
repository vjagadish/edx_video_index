[BLANK_AUDIO].

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,348
In this next module,

3
00:00:06,348 --> 00:00:09,600
I'm going to tell you about multivariate
repeated-measures ANOVA.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,000
So up until now we've been talking about
univariate repeated-measures ANOVA.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,440
Now I want to tell you multivariate
repeated measures ANOVA,

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,240
which approaches these types of data in a
different way.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,210
So the key to multivariate repeated
measures ANOVA is,

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,329
that there's actually more than one
dependent variable.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,340
Rather than having a single dependent
variable,

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,730
we actually have a vector of outcome
variables.

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,060
And in fact because of that, it's not just
used for repeated measures ANOVA, it would

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,310
be appropriate for other situations when
you have multiple dependent variables.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,300
I'm only going to talk about the case of
applying it to repeated measure and data.

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,200
And the best way to understand
multivariate repeated measures ANOVA,

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,060
is actually just to think back to when we
did paired T tests.

16
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,060
It's essentially analogous to a paired T
test.

17
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,040
So remember, we used a paired t-test
actually before for

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,750
repeated measures, when we only had two
time points.

19
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,470
And the way a paired t-test works is that
you

20
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,710
subtract the values between the two time
points, and you get a difference value.

21
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,782
How much did a person change from time
point one, to time point two?

22
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,640
We're going to calculate the difference
value for everybody, and

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,590
then we're going to calculate the average
difference for this sample.

24
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,150
And the null hypothesis for

25
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,230
a paired t test is that the difference is
equal to zero.

26
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,800
So on average people didn't go, didn't go
up or down, they didn't change.

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,200
Then there is no effect.

28
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,400
So we would take the average difference
and

29
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,330
divide that by the standard error for the
average differences.

30
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,050
We divided by a standard error.

31
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,250
That's kind of a t distribution.

32
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,290
And so essentially our outcome here is
just difference values.

33
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,750
A single different value for each person.

34
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,480
The only difference with the multivariate
repeated measures ANOVA,

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,290
is that we are now going to look at a
vector of differences rather than

36
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,430
a single difference for every person.

37
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,060
So in the example data set I've been
using,

38
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,160
there were five time points, so each
person actually has three differences.

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,820
They have the difference between time one
and

40
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,690
two, between time two and three and
between time three and four.

41
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,050
And that, those three values could be
thought of as a vector of differences.

42
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,050
So MANOVA is essentially just a paired t
test where the outcome variable is

43
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,880
a vector of difference values rather than
a single difference.

44
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,670
It's sort of an extension of the pair t
test.

45
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,840
So we can have multiple time points, more
than two.

46
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,370
And we can calculate a statistic based on
the,

47
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,210
comparing the average of the vector of
differences to its standard error.

48
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:49,560
And the null hypothesis here, is that the
difference one between the first

49
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,760
two time points and zero and difference
two between the next two time points and

50
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,400
zero and difference three between the next
two time points and zero and so on.

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,210
That all the difference values on average
are zero.

52
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,419
That would say that there's no changes
happening over time.

53
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,330
And one of the statistics, I'm not going
go into the details of this statistic,

54
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,230
it involves vectors and

55
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,940
things, but you can make a statistic, one
of them is called Hotel Lengths Trace.

56
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,990
So take that little example data set that
I've been using with just these

57
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,280
six subjects.

58
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,820
I had four time points.

59
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,800
So I'm going to get three difference
values.

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,830
So now, the values for subject one are no
longer the absolute values.

61
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,280
I don't know what their absolute value of
depression score is, but

62
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,870
I know that they went down two units
between time point one and two.

63
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,510
And then down 14 more units between two,
time points two and three.

64
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,900
And then up 11 units between time points
three and four.

65
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,900
I've now got a vector of differences on
each of these subjects.

66
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,310
Couple of caveats to think about here.

67
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,900
We're rating all of these differences
equally, so

68
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,300
it's hard to interpret them if the time
intervals are unevenly spaced.

69
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,400
So imagine that time point one was zero
months into the study, and

70
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,570
then you measure people again at one
month, and

71
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,840
then you didn't measure people again until
a year.

72
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,760
Well the first difference would represent
the one month change,

73
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,460
the second difference would represent an
11 month change, and obviously those

74
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,080
might be different just because the
different spacing of the time intervals.

75
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,390
So this is assuming we have evenly or
reasonably evenly spaced time intervals.

76
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,980
Where the other assumption is that we have
a normally distributed outcome.

77
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,420
This would following a multivariate normal
distribution, but same idea.

78
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,240
And that we have a homogeneity of
variances at each of

79
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,510
the time points again.

80
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,830
The null hypothesis is that all of the
average different scores are zero.

81
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,130
You can see that the difference between
time rates two and three, it looks like

82
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,450
kind of, there was, we, we already saw in
the picture that it was going down.

83
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,750
There's a lot of negatives there.

84
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,400
And in time points three and four, there
seems to be more positives.

85
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,220
But is that enough to be significantly
different from zero.

86
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,870
I'm just starting this by ignoring groups
and

87
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,550
asking the simple question, are there
significant changes over time?

88
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,670
Are any of the changes, differences
between time points significant?

89
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,326
And when I run these statistics,

90
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:02,670
I ran the multivariate repeated measures
in ANOVA in SASS.

91
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,348
The p value that I get is 0.1876.

92
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:08,190
So my null hypothesis is all the
differences are zero and

93
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,570
I can't reject that.

94
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,780
So I don't have evidence that there is
really a significant difference over

95
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,270
time even though there looks to be some
difference in time point three.

96
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,910
Notice you get four slightly different
statistics here.

97
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,404
There are different statisticians who have
come up with certainly,

98
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:24,160
certain different ways of calculating
this.

99
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:25,850
In this case,

100
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,920
because the data aren't complicated, all
the p values come out to be the same.

101
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,380
And just compare this to when we did the
repeated measures univariate aNOVA.

102
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,960
This is the time effect that we got when
we just had time in the model and

103
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,700
nothing else, when we were ignoring group.

104
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,310
We got a p value of 0.13 that was adjusted
for the violation of compound symmetry.

105
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,100
So we got a lit, p value that's a little
bit less, than what we got for

106
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
the, from the multivariate ANOVA.

107
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,550
But they're both saying that we

108
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,620
don't have enough evidence to reject the
null hypothesis.

109
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,330
We do not have a significant time effect.

110
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,290
Statisticians would recommend that if
there's differences between these p

111
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,080
values that you would choose the Wilks'
Lambda in general.

112
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,080
But if you had a small sample, and some of
the assumptions of the model,

113
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,890
the normality and homogeneity of variances
was violated to use Pillai's Trace,

114
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,040
which was the second one, here.

115
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,700
So that's when I've just put time in the
model,

116
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,530
of course we would also like to
additionally consider group.

117
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,850
Now, it's important to keep in mind,

118
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,670
that when you're doing multivariate
repeated measures ANOVA.

119
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,130
We're looking at difference values.

120
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,890
We never consider the absolute values.

121
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,600
Whether or not you have a depression score
of 30 or 100.

122
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,560
We only compare, consider how much it went
up or down.

123
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,280
So that means that for repeated measures
multivariate, ANOVA,

124
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,790
there are actually going to be no between
subjects effects, okay?

125
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,150
Because I can't tell you whether or not
subject one is higher than subject two.

126
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,350
And I can't tell you whether or

127
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,710
not group A has a higher depression score
than Group B.

128
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,280
I'm only looking at within subjects
effects,

129
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,240
because I'm only looking at the changes
over time.

130
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,940
Now, this was the picture when we brought
group in.

131
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,090
B looks a little higher overall than A.

132
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,490
We will not be getting that group
difference here.

133
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,320
But the pattern over time kind of looks
pretty similar between the two groups.

134
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,850
We already saw that.

135
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,320
So now I'm going to run my repeated
measures multivariate ANOVA with,

136
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,380
group in the model.

137
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,060
And, by the way, in SASS at least, you
just ask for repeated-measures ANOVA and

138
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,130
it gives you both the univariate results
and

139
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,830
the multivariate results in the output, so
you get both.

140
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,630
I'm going to get from the multivariate
repeated measures ANOVA.

141
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,740
I'm going to get here a time effect and a
group by time interaction, and that's it.

142
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,340
So the time effect comes out to be 0.32.

143
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,480
This would say that there's no overall
differences between time.

144
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,740
So overall ignoring group, there doesn't
seem to be any significant time effect.

145
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,280
And again, we saw that in the picture.

146
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,220
If you look at everybody, it kind of goes
like this, and a little bit of a dip in

147
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,250
time point three, but it wasn't enough to
trigger statistical significance.

148
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,180
So there's no significant time effect.

149
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,496
We saw that in the repeated measures ANOVA
univariate version, the p value was 0.17.

150
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:13,046
So basically giving us the same answer,
not significant.

151
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:15,860
And then the time by group interaction,

152
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,230
that one clearly the two groups seem to
have the same pattern over time.

153
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,370
So that one's clearly not significant.

154
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,090
So the changes, the differences between
the time points don't seem to

155
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,410
differ between the two groups.

156
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,130
And for comparison the univariate result
for

157
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,860
the time by group interaction was also
highly nonsignificant 0.69.

158
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,450
So we can from the multivariate repeated

159
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,450
measures ANOVA we get basically the same
results as we did from the univariate.

160
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,270
And so if we ask the question, are there
any significant changes over time,

161
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,520
differences between time points?

162
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,750
That's a time main effect.

163
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,700
We did not see a main effect for time.

164
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,680
Now we cannot actually ask the question
about whether the two groups differ at

165
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,240
any time points.

166
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,160
We don't, we are unable to get a group
effect,

167
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,480
the overall effect of differences between
groups.

168
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,050
Again, we don't have any absolute values
in the analysis, so

169
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,390
I can't tell you if group A is higher than
group B overall.

170
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,460
So we're not going to get that from the
multivariate version.

171
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,680
We will get a p value for the group by
time effect.

172
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,910
And therefore we can ask the question
about whether the two groups differ in

173
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,810
their responses over time.

174
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,400
And that was clearly non-significant here,
as we saw.

175
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,496
Now just for fun, I thought it would be
nice to also throw in to the multivariate

176
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:32,100
repeated-measures ANOVA these data on bone
density that we've been looking at.

177
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,510
So here's the picture again for that.

178
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:40,180
That we saw for the univariant, repeated
measures ANOVA results,

179
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,020
we had a significant time effect and a
borderline significant time by

180
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,210
group effect, and we get, pretty much same
results here.

181
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,142
So the time effect is significant, 0.002.

182
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:53,900
It was 0.0006, a little bit smaller when
we did the univariate.

183
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,000
But you can see that on average, it does
look like the bone density's going up.

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,240
The group by time effect is borderline
significant.

185
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,080
It was 0.06 when we did the univariate
version.

186
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,770
It's 0.07 when we did the multivariate
version, so about the same.

187
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:12,850
This doesn't quite make statistical
significance that those groups differ in

188
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,500
their profiles over time, almost.

189
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,400
So we're getting basically the same
answer.

190
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,480
You'll notice that the p values from the
multivariate tend to be just a little bit

191
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,020
higher, than the ones from the univariate.

192
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,480
And that's because if the compound
symmetry assumption is met,

193
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,720
the univariate approach actually has more
power, more statistical power.

194
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,080
Now if the compound symmetry is not met
however,

195
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,390
we are increasing our type one error by
using the univariate approach.

196
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,060
So we're more likely to get a false
positive so

197
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,050
the p values tend to be smaller for the
univariate.

198
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,480
They're appropriately smaller if we meet
this compound symmetry assumption, but

199
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,750
not if we don't.

200
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,700
So there's slight differences between the
two in that way.

201
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,690
They usually give reasonably similar
answers, however.

202
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,124
And so just to summarize repeated-measures
ANOVA.

203
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:02,686
Both of the univariant and

204
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:06,550
the multivariate versions, you have to
impute missing data.

205
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,560
If a person is missing just one time
point, they are completely thrown out of

206
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,580
the analysis, so you have to fill in
something, for that missing data.

207
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,510
Repeated measures, univeriant ANOVA
requires compound symmetry.

208
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,760
So that's a restrictive assumption.

209
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,660
Now there are p value corrections for this
as we saw.

210
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,710
We are treating time essentially as
categorical in these analysis.

211
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,180
So we're requiring that subjects who,

212
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,180
they have to be measured at the same time
points, because if everybody's measured at

213
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,540
different time points it really doesn't
make sense to group them into categorical

214
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,830
time points.

215
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,380
And as we saw with the multivariate
repeated measures ANOVA.

216
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,400
Since we're looking at difference values,

217
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,330
we are making the assumption that the time
intervals are reasonably even.

218
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,300
The advantages of the, the map is,

219
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,420
however, they're pretty easy to implement
and interpret.

220
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,660
They're pretty straightforward, once you
get the hang of them, to interpret them.

221
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,900
They're not too complex.

222
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:05,180
So as we turn to talking about generalized
estimating equations and mixed models,

223
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,810
you're going to see that a lot of these
disadvantages are not a problem,

224
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,070
for those more sophisticated models.

225
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,080
But the models get a little bit more
complicated to interpret.

226
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,950
Just for fun, I thought it would be fun
even though we haven't gotten to GEE and

227
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,720
mixed models yet, I thought it would be
fun just to throw that bone density data,

228
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,800
into a GE model and a mixed model.

229
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,450
And compare with what we got from the
repeated measures ANOVA analysis.

230
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,080
So I went ahead and did that.

231
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,190
You can see it's a little more
complicated.

232
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,510
But I ran a GEE model.

233
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,170
And you don't have to understand all of
this yet,

234
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,480
I'll just sort of walk you through what's
relevant here.

235
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,930
But I ran a GEE model for the same spine
bone density data, so

236
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,970
my outcome here is fine bone density.

237
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,630
And I have three groups, again, black, I'm
calling them black, red, and

238
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,700
blue for simplicity.

239
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,950
The main effects that I'm getting for
black, red, and blue correspond to

240
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,390
the main effect for group, that I was
getting from the univariate,

241
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,530
repeated measures of ANOVA, and those are
not significant, as we saw before.

242
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,120
I am getting a time effect, which is
saying,

243
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,010
does the bone density differ significantly
over time?

244
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,830
But, in these regression models the time
effect is not an average over all of

245
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,500
the groups, it is the time effect for the
reference group only.

246
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,550
So, this time effect corresponds us to the
changes over time for

247
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,100
the blue group, and that's clearly not
significant,

248
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,650
because the blue group isn't changing much
over time.

249
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,850
The, then we have a time by group
interaction.

250
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,410
And we break it down by the black group
and the red group, and

251
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,770
the blue group, of course, is the
reference group.

252
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,270
What do we get?

253
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,835
We get an estimate here that's 0.01, and
0.014.

254
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:46,840
And what that's saying is that we're going
up by

255
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,690
about one gram per centimeter square,
which is roughly a percent,

256
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,220
in bone density more, per year, in the
black group versus the blue group.

257
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,690
And that does make statistical
significance.

258
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,160
And for the red group, were going up even
a little bit more than that,

259
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,560
about 0.0140 grams per centimeter square.

260
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,650
Per year more, about 1.4% more in the red
group versus the blue group per year, and

261
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,670
that is highly significant.

262
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,856
And you'll notice that we achieve
statistical significance on

263
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:16,747
the time by group effect in the GEE model
where we didn't in

264
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:19,480
the less powerful repeated measures ANOVA
models.

265
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,970
And we get very similar results when we do
mixed models.

266
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,210
I won't go through the whole results here
again because you'll

267
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,610
notice the parameter estimates look very
similar, the p values look very similar.

268
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,890
So we're getting a similar result with a
mixed model.

269
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,369
