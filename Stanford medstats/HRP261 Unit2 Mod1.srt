1
00:00:06,128 --> 00:00:10,020
In this next module, I'm going to talk
about what a confounding variable is.

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,660
So, a confounder is a variable that

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,860
is associated with both the predictor and
the outcome.

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,890
but it is not on the causal pathway
between the predictor and the outcome.

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,700
So this would look something like,

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,900
you've got a third variable that's related
to both the predictor and the outcome.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,910
The predictor and the outcome maybe aren't
related to each other.

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,250
But because they're both related to the
confounder,

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,100
you see a spurious association between the
predictor and the outcome.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,210
That's one thing that can happen with
confounding Confounders can

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,000
also obscure relationships.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,250
So perhaps the confounder is inversely
related to either the predictor

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:44,790
and the outcome.,

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,240
And it might actually mask a relationship
between those variables,

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,890
it might cause you to miss seeing a
relationship.

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,400
So both of those things can happen.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,060
Confounding is best illustrated with some
examples.

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:01,150
So I'm going to start here with basically
the reason that confounding exists,

19
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,750
is that risk factors tend to cluster.

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,550
People who have bad health habits in one
domain,

21
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,670
tend to have bad health habits in a lot of
domains.

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,350
For example.

23
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,350
And this is really well illustrated by a
study that

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,920
looked at red meat intake and mortality.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,040
And this is just the descriptive table,

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,610
the table one from that study, looking at
the men.

27
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,650
And I think this is a really nice table to
look at,

28
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,050
because it just shows you how clustered
risk factors can be.

29
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,950
So this study was looking at Quintiles of
red meat intake, so

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,920
they divided the men up into quintiles of
red meat intake.

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,850
Q1 is the lowest quintile, the lowest red
meat eaters, Q5 is the highest quintile,

32
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,990
so the, those who are eating the most.

33
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,850
Red meat.

34
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,440
And if you kind of scroll down this table,
it's

35
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,810
just showing you basic characteristics,
but go to exam, for example to BMI.

36
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,600
This of course is a risk factor for poor
health outcomes.

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,210
If you look at BMI, starting with Q1, the
first quartile,

38
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,500
the first quartile, the BMI, the average
BMI is 25.9.

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,320
And as you go across the quartiles it goes
up Just beautifully across the,

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,110
I'm sorry, across the quintiles, until you
get to the highest quintile of meat,

41
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,690
red meat intake, and BMI is up to 28.3.

42
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,040
You look at smoking, so not too many
smokers, current smokers in the,

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,750
in the lowest meat eating group.

44
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,550
As you go up across the quintiles of meat
eating.

45
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:27,150
Eating, red meat eating it goes up just,
you know, 4.9, 7.6, 9.9, 11.4, 14.8.

46
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,860
It just goes up so beautifully, all of the
bad habits go up,

47
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,520
as you go up across the quintiles of red
meat eating, and you can

48
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,740
see that with some of the other factors
that are listed in this table as well.

49
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,890
This just goes to show you that people who
have a one bad health habit,

50
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,480
such as eating red meat tend to have lots
of other bad habits,

51
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,420
such as smoking, being heavier, not
exercising.

52
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,600
That makes it really difficult in
observational studies to tease out,

53
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,390
is it red meat that is causing them to die
earlier, or is it these other factors, or

54
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,910
is it a combination of all of them and

55
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,780
part of what we're going to try to do in
this course.

56
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,240
is to build regression models that try to
tease out exactly what is

57
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,440
the causal factor.

58
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,440
But I just want to start by letting you
know that that is

59
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,240
actually a very hard thing to do.

60
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,300
We're going to try to do statistically,
but

61
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,790
it's difficult because these things
cluster so strongly.

62
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,170
That's why confounding arises.

63
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,200
Now let me give you just a simple
hypothetical confounding example.

64
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,090
This is sort of a prototypical example of
confounding.

65
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,630
So, imagine you go out and do a study and

66
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,690
you look at heavy drinkers compared to
people who maybe light or non-drinkers.

67
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,530
And you look at the incidence rates of
lung cancer among

68
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,310
drinkers versus non-drinkers.

69
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,200
You will actually find that drinkers get
lung cancer at

70
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,600
a much higher rate than non-drinkers or
light drinkers.

71
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,760
So you might therefore conclude that
alcohol raises your risk of lung cancer.

72
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,150
And that wouldn't be totally unreasonable
because we actually do know that

73
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,160
alcohol increases the risks of certain
cancers, such as breast cancer.

74
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,455
That's pretty well established.

75
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:11,420
However, it turns out that in this
particular case for lung cancer,

76
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,110
alcohol actually is not biologically
related to lung cancer, as far as we know.

77
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,090
It appears that those are not related
causally.

78
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,350
Of course, there is a very important
confounder,

79
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,110
a third variable lurking in the background
here.

80
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,880
So, heavy drinkers also tend to be
smokers.

81
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,450
And, we know for sure that smoking is
strongly related to lung cancer.

82
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,160
So smoking in this picture is the
confounding variable.

83
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,140
So you see that smoking is related both to
alcohol and

84
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,040
to lung cancer, but it's not on the causal
pathway between those two,

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,080
because in fact, alcohol is not causally
related to lung cancer.

86
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,350
The association here was completely driven
by confounding with smoking.

87
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,900
And I think it's helpful sometimes,

88
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,530
to just put some hypothetical numbers, to
illustrate this with some numbers.

89
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,510
So what would it look like in terms of
numerically,

90
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,600
what does a confounder look like?

91
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
So I just made up just some hypothetical
numbers here.

92
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,670
You can see they're made up, because there
are a lot of zeros.

93
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:09,090
But just as a simple example, imagine that
you went out and did a case control study.

94
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,920
You sample 100 lung cancer cases and 200
controls who don't have lung cancer.

95
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,890
If you then asked about, who's a drinker,
say a heavy drinker versus a non or

96
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,980
light drinker.

97
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,040
You would actually find that indeed,

98
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,410
more of the lung cancer cases had a
history of heavy drinking.

99
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,935
And I've illustrated that numerically
here, so in this particular example I said

100
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:34,720
50% of the cases are drinkers versus only
25% of the controls are drinkers.

101
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,300
So you can see that there is a strong
relationship here.

102
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,100
This is a case control study, so just to
review from last week,

103
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,330
we could calculate an odds ratio, the odds
ratio here will be 50 times a 150, divided

104
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:49,998
by 50 times 50, in other words that would
be 3, the odds ratio here, would be 3.

105
00:05:49,998 --> 00:05:53,589
It appears therefore, that drinking is
strongly associated with lung cancer.

106
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,530
However, we know that there's this third
variable,

107
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,960
the smoking variable, lurking behind the
scenes.

108
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,950
So what happens when we try to account for
smoking?

109
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,630
Well a very simple way to account for
smoking would be to simply.

110
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,940
Look only, compare smokers only to smokers
and

111
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,190
compare non-smokers only to non-smokers.

112
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,900
And in fact, that's what I'm going to do
here.

113
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,628
I'm going to stratify my table on smoking,
divide it into smokers and

114
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:25,120
non-smokers, and look specifically within
each of those strata.

115
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,610
So, if we turn to the smokers.

116
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,810
What you'll notice with the smokers is
that there's a large number of

117
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,600
lung cancer cases among the smokers.

118
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,060
That would be expected because of course,

119
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,830
smoking is very strongly related to lung
cancer.

120
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,170
So 75% of the smokers had lung cancer,
were cases.

121
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,098
You can also see that a lot of smokers
drink.

122
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:49,520
So I, I've made the total here just 100 to
make it really easy to do percentages.

123
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,130
You can see that we have 45 plus 15 or 60
drinkers so 60% of my sample as drinkers.

124
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,550
So among the smokers your very likely to
have lung cancer your also very likely to

125
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,960
be a drinker, however, if you restrict to
just the smokers and

126
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,492
you look at the relationship between
drinking and cancer within the smokers.

127
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:15,310
In fact 60% of lung cancer cases are
drinkers and 60% of controls are drinkers,

128
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,450
so once we restrict to smokers even though
drinking is high and lung cancer is high,

129
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,630
you can actually see that there is no
relationship between drinking.

130
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,580
And being a case or control among the
smokers.

131
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,968
Then you turn to the non-smokers.

132
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:30,790
Among the non-smokers, you can see lung
cancer was much more rare.

133
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:36,820
Only 25 out of 200, 12.5% had lung cancer
in the non-smoking group.

134
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,480
And drinking was much more rare.

135
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,790
So only in this case 20% of the total
were, were drinkers.

136
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,920
Again though, if you look at the
relationship between drinking and

137
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,770
cancer just within the non-smokers, it
turns out 20% of the lung cancer cases

138
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,620
were drinkers and 20% of the controls were
drinkers so there's no relationship.

139
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,380
Now between drinking and cancer.

140
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,750
So stratifying on smoking allows you to
see that actually,

141
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,080
there's no relationship between drinking
and cancer once you've accounted for

142
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,080
smoking, and the way we've accounted for
it here is just to stratify on it.

143
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,470
But that's the kind of, what you're going
to kind of see numerically.

144
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:18,210
Now, I just want to throw in a real life
example of confounding here.

145
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:24,100
This is a very interesting story, that
goes back to, many decades actually.

146
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,910
And for a long time, women were prescribed
postmenopausal hormones for

147
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,720
many reasons and I was actually a graduate
student back in the late.

148
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,800
1990s, and I studied osteoporosis, and we
happen to know with pretty good

149
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,420
certainty that if you put postmenopausal
women on hormones, estrogen and

150
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,880
progestin, that it actually does indeed
prevent osteoporosis.

151
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,000
However, when I was a graduate student in
the 90s.

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,620
It was also widely believed that
postmenopausal hormone

153
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:58,050
therapy reduced a woman's risk of heart
disease and there was a lot of evidence,

154
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,750
a lot of lines of evidence, particularly
from observational studies to support that

155
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,060
protective effect, so this would.

156
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,570
The protective effect here that it looked
like that, that the therapy,

157
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,262
the hormones reduced the risk of heart
attacks.

158
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,150
However, again, most of that data was
coming from observational studies and

159
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,330
you can imagine a number of confounders
could be at play here.

160
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,840
So it turned out that the women who were
taking hormone replacement therapy

161
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,830
tended to be more well-educated to have a
higher socioeconomic status.

162
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,590
They tended to be healthier in a lot of
different ways.

163
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:35,640
They were less likely to smoke, because
smoking was a contraindication for

164
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,850
taking estrogen and progestin.

165
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,950
So there's a lot of reasons Why women on
this therapy might have

166
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,350
had lower heart disease,

167
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,220
that weren't necessarily a biological
connection between those two things.

168
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,100
But just to kind of show you how widely
accepted the dogma was that

169
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,670
estrogen therapy, or estrogen and
progestin therapy prevents heart disease.

170
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,830
This is an article going all the way back
to 1996,

171
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,020
when I was starting graduate school.

172
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,160
And if you read through this article, I've
just put a few quotes in here.

173
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,610
It was pretty much, you can see that,

174
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:09,350
though the language is written in as a way
that it was accepted fact that,

175
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:14,690
in particular, estrogen after menopause,
would reduce the risk of heart disease.

176
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,460
You can see more than 30 studies have
found that estrogen after menopause is

177
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,620
good for the heart.

178
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,880
So it was really widely accepted dogma.

179
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,360
And there was, again, a lot of evidence to
back this up.

180
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,160
So here's one of the studies that helped
establish that.

181
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,320
This is called the Nurses' Health study.

182
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,610
It's a cohort study that followed nurses,
over many decades.

183
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,960
It's done out of Harvard, some great data
from this, but it you

184
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,540
look carefully at this particular paper,
which was published many decades ago.

185
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,750
They were looking at major heart disease.

186
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,820
And if you look at estrogen alone or
estrogen with progesterone,

187
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,090
the two sort of forms of post menopausal
hormone therapy, and

188
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,590
you look at the relative risks for heart
disease, so the, this is just in the first

189
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,836
column is the age adjusted relative risks
so that you can see they're very

190
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:04,650
protective, .45 and .22, that's really far
from one in the protective direction.

191
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,510
And even if you do multivariate
adjustment, where you try to adjust for

192
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,940
confounders, they're still protective .6
and .39.

193
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,380
Now notice that as we went from age
adjustment to adjusting for all these

194
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:22,290
other confounders, The relative risks get
closer to one, the effect size gets

195
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,940
attenuated, they don't, these therapies
don't look quite as protective anymore.

196
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,250
That's a clue to you,

197
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,690
that there is definitely important
confounding going on here.

198
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,740
We were able to adjust for

199
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,230
some of it hence, the relative risks got
closer to one.

200
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,150
But even in this study where we were
adjusting for all these confounders

201
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,530
we're still cutting the risk of heart
disease about in half with those hormones.

202
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,050
So this was one, just one of the many
examples of observational studies that

203
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,350
even though they had tried to adjust for
confounding, still found that

204
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,300
these hormones were protective against
heart disease in postmenopausal women.

205
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,370
All right, well a long comment comes in
2002.

206
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,930
The results of the,

207
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,180
the early results of a, a study called the
Women's Health Initiative.

208
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,520
So this is where researchers actually went
out and

209
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,920
decided we've done a lot of observational
trials, what we really need to do is to

210
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,030
randomize women to take postmenopausal
hormones or a placebo pill so that we can

211
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:22,480
really see what happens getting, removing
a lot of the confounding from the picture.

212
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,770
So this was a very large randomized trial.

213
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,640
The trial was actually stopped early.

214
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,450
It was stopped in 2002 because when they
did an interim look at the data,

215
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,120
they found that hormones had more risks
than benefits.

216
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,130
So they found out hormones increased your
risk of breast cancer,

217
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,000
which was actually an expected outcome,
that was not surprising.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,440
But what really surprised people, what was
unexpected, is that

219
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,360
they found that the hormones actually
increased the risk of heart disease,

220
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,480
not protected against it but increased it.

221
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,040
And you can see that illustrated here in
this graph in the left hand panel,

222
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,320
this is just showing the cumulative risk
of getting heart disease.

223
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,560
And the top graph,

224
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,160
which has a higher rate of heart disease
is the, is the group on hormones.

225
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,700
The placebo group is the lower graph.

226
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,510
And people were expecting this to come out
the opposite.

227
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,990
So the trial was actually stopped early.

228
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,700
Because even though we thought that the
hormones

229
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,660
were protected against the heart disease.

230
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,750
In fact they increased a woman's risk and

231
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,310
probably a lot of the observational
studies that were done and that had.

232
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,030
Setup this dogma that, that it's hormones
were protective,

233
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,120
a lot of them didn't get the right answer
because of confounding and

234
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,830
it just goes to show you how difficult it
really is, as much as we're

235
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:41,890
going to try to account for confounders,
its very difficult to fully account for

236
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,060
confounding and sometimes in the case like
this, that con, you know that

237
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:50,160
confounders were not fully adjusted for in
the observational study and therefore

238
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,000
the observational studies were getting the
opposite of the correct answer.

239
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,380
I just want to tell you about how we're
going to attempt to control for

240
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,450
confounders in medical studies.

241
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,120
So one way to [INAUDIBLE] control for
confounders is to control for

242
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,680
them in the design of the study.

243
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,480
So as I've alluded to here, randomization
So if you randomly assign people to

244
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,490
one treatment or another, or one group or
another.

245
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,829
That takes away a lot of the confounding
because now all these,

246
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:21,490
the clustering of risk factors that goes
away.

247
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,100
So that's probably the best way to deal
with confounding is just to randomize,

248
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,970
of course we can't always do a randomize
trial.

249
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,890
You can also do something called
restriction which would

250
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,080
be something like if you thought smoking
was an important confounder you

251
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,670
could decide to restrict your study to
only study non-smokers.

252
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,040
You could also do matching which we talked
about last week.

253
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,670
This is not a course of study design so we
are going to assume that for

254
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,230
the purposes of this course we're.

255
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,290
Stuck with the data that,

256
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,320
that have already been collected and we're
not talking about the design of the study.

257
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,490
But at the point where we have data and
say we didn't do a randomized trial,

258
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,520
how can we then go ahead and control for

259
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,732
confounders in the analysis phase of this
study?

260
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:04,700
And the main way that we're going to do
that, and the main.

261
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,040
You know, that I've sort of been talking
about in most of these examples.

262
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,070
The main way people adjust for confounding
is with multivariate regression.

263
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,970
We're going to get to that starting next
week.

264
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,660
But I just want to show you this week that
there is kind of a simple way to

265
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,360
look at confounders.

266
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,000
I.

267
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,860
It gets back to the lung cancer example I
gave earlier in this module.

268
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,610
We can try to stratify on the confounder
if it's a categorical confounder.

269
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,920
So this week we're going to talk about
methods that involve stratification.
