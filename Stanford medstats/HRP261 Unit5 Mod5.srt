1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,400
In this next module, I'm going to talk
about dummy coding.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,070
I'm assuming that most of you have seen
dummy coding before so

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,310
this will be largely review.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,920
I'll go through it rather quickly.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,650
But I'm going to tell you how it applies
specifically in

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,229
the context of linguistic regression.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,650
So, when you want to do a regression, how
do you model categorical predictors?

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,290
How do you put categorical predictors in
the model.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,260
It's obvious how to put numerical ones in
the model, but

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,620
what about categorical predictors?

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,320
How does that, how does that work?

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,900
So, actually it's very simple for binary
predictors.

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,840
If you've got a binary predictor, You can
just code it as zero one and

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,158
actually treat it as a number.

15
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:42,140
0 and 1 are numbers, so we can just treat
it as a quantitative variable and

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,550
just stick it in a regression as a 0, 1
variable.

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,270
So, that's essentially what we do with
binary variables.

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:51,270
For categorical variables, we're going to
have to do dummy coding.

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,540
Dummy coding means that we're going to
re-code the categorical predictor as

20
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,450
a series of binary predictors.

21
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,490
Since it's easy to deal with binary
predictors because we

22
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,925
can treat them as zeros and ones, we can
actually just rip,

23
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:05,070
re-represent categorical predictions as a
series of binary variables.

24
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,150
That's the basic idea.

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,570
So let me just give you a few pictures
here to illustrate.

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,720
So here is a logit plot, okay.

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,419
So this the logit of stress fractures.

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,370
Lower rate of stress fractures in my data
set on women runners this is whether or

29
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,710
not you have amenorrhea.

30
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,310
You either have amenorrhea, which is the,

31
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,230
the most severe menstrual irregularity, or
you don't.

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,415
It's a binary variable, so here's my lojit
plot.

33
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:33,530
Woo-hoo!

34
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,090
If I do my lojit plot there's only two
points, right?

35
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,520
So, there's only two lojits, the lojit for

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,910
the 0 group, and the lojit for the 1
group.

37
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,850
And so, since there's only two points,
it's always going to be a line.

38
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,190
Well, guess what, you don't have to do
logec plots when it comes to

39
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,210
categorical variables because primary
variables,

40
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,940
binary variables, two points is always
going to equal a line.

41
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,290
So, that's nice.

42
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,030
One less piece of work that you have to
do.

43
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,050
Binary variables you can just stick in the
model without thinking too hard about it.

44
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,420
What about, though, if you have more than
two categories.

45
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,910
So that's where binary variables, if you
have more than two categories you're

46
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,530
going to need to use To use dummy coding,
and

47
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,540
most statistical packages will
automatically dummy code for you.

48
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,570
So it's not like you have to do this on
your own, but you need to understand what

49
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,760
the computer is doing, and what's coming
out in your model.

50
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,200
So I'm just going to to take a simple
example from this data set

51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,870
on women runners.

52
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,920
So there's sort of three categories of
menstrual function that

53
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,030
are usually recognized clinically.

54
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,320
Amenorrhea is basically the absence of
periods, or very few periods per year.

55
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,730
Oligomenorrhea is sort of, irregular
periods but

56
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,110
not the total absence of periods.

57
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,440
And eumenorrhea is just normal, you know,
having more than nine periods per year.

58
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,910
So that we can look at those three
categories rather than, we, in,

59
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,830
in an earlier sample we looked at the
number of periods per year as

60
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,540
a continuous variable.

61
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,770
But, since there's a nice clinical
characterization here we could also look

62
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,500
at this variable, as, as a categorical
variable in these three categories.

63
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,400
But how are we going to include it into
the regression model?

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,480
So the way that we're going to do it is
we're going to dummy code,

65
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,790
and here's how dummy coding works.

66
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,580
A three level categorical variable will
have Will be dummy coded as

67
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,670
two binary variables.

68
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,380
A 4-level categorical variable would be
dummy coded as

69
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,830
three binary variables and so on.

70
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,300
So we have to pick something as the
reference group.

71
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,320
In this example, it makes sense to, to use
Eumenorrheic as the, the normal

72
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,220
functioning women as the reference So this
is going to be my reference group.

73
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,810
I'm going to define a new binary variable
that is,

74
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,980
you're either amenorrheic or you're not.

75
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,390
So women who are amenorrheic will get a
value of 1 for

76
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:31,100
this variable, and everybody else will get
everybody else will get a value of 0.

77
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,870
So you're either amenorrheic or you're
not.

78
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,340
So the oligomenorrheic and the
eumenorrheic women will get values of 0.

79
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,140
I'm going to define a second binary
variable, oligomenorrheic.

80
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,470
And if you're oligomenorrheic, you're
going to get a value of on 1 and

81
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,860
if you're not you're going to get a value
of 0.

82
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,250
So women who get a value of 0 on the
amenorrheia variable and

83
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,820
get a oligomenorrheia variable by default
are in that reference,

84
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,060
the eumenorrheic category.

85
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,500
We're then going to take these two binary
vairables and

86
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,980
we're going to put them into our model.

87
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,880
So the logit of stress factors then,

88
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,730
we would model this as in a receipt plus a
beta for

89
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,660
that binary variable eumenorrhea, plus a
beta for the variable oligomenorrhea.

90
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,950
We are, does eumenorrhea come into this
picture well that has been it's, the,

91
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,190
it's absorbed essentially in the,

92
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,780
the intercept, it's represented by the
intercept.

93
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,880
Then we have 2 additional parameters, so

94
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,240
I've got a 3 level categorical variable,
I'm going to have to put.

95
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,940
Two parameters in my model, two betas in
my model.

96
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,810
If I had a 5 level categorical variable,
I'd have to put 4 betas into my model.

97
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,050
Now, pictorially, what we're really doing
is we're just essentially breaking this

98
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,670
into a series of binary variables.

99
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,420
So again, you don't have to do the Logia
plots here because if

100
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,930
you look at the Logia plots, I'm going to
be comparing,

101
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,160
what I'm ending up doing is comparing
amenorrheic women to normal women.

102
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,500
So here's my reference group, the normal
women.

103
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,560
I'm going to compare this is actually
umenorrheic and this is amenorrheic.

104
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,290
This is umenorrheic versus
oligomenorrheic,

105
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,390
that's what the values represent here.

106
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,440
So I compare my amenorrheic woman to my
umenorrheic woman.

107
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,210
It's just a two group comparison, so
again, 2 points make a line.

108
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,450
Notice that the logit for the amenorrheic
group is at negative 2.6,

109
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,860
same logit over here, same group, also at
negative 2.6, but now I'm comparing to

110
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,390
my oligomenorrheic group which has a
slightly lower logit than.

111
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,780
So literally I'm putting into my model a
201 comparisons.

112
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,890
Now when I actually run this in my
statistical program,

113
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,450
I can ask my statistical program to do
this dummy coding for me.

114
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,470
It's usually built-in.

115
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,250
It's very easy to do, for example, in SAS.

116
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,050
And then I can get out some betas.

117
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,390
My betas are all going to be compared to
the reference group,

118
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,110
and of course, since we're doing logistic
regression,

119
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,820
it's nice to translate these directly into
odds ratios.

120
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,110
It makes very interpretable odds ratios
because we're now,

121
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,540
we're comparing Amennoreic to the
reference group and

122
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,430
Oligomenorrheic to the reference group.

123
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,390
So notice that the Amennoreic women,
really do

124
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:59,100
have quite a,a large increase in their
odds of getting a stress fracture here.

125
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,210
6.8 is the odds ratio.

126
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,410
For them oligomenorrheic women have
somewhat of an increased risk but

127
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,040
the alteration is only 2.4 so not quite as
big and

128
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,770
this one did not come out to be
statistically significant.

129
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,080
So that's the basic idea I'm going to come
out with In logistic regression, an odds

130
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,370
ratio, a separate odd ratio for each
category compared to the reference group.

131
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,620
Now which category am I going to choose to
be the reference group?

132
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,570
That's a decision you usually have to
make.

133
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,526
Of course it doesn't effect the math.

134
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:28,060
The SAS doesn't order your computer,

135
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,740
doesn't really care what you choose as the
reference group.

136
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,930
But usually there's some kind of a group
that makes sense to choose as

137
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,180
the reference group, and you want to make
sure you go in, and, every computer

138
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,670
package will have a way to, will choose a
reference group for you by default.

139
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,170
You want to go in and change that to the
more, the sensible reference group.

140
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,820
So like if you're doing an experimental
trial,

141
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,000
clearly you want the reference group to be
the control group.

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,320
If you're still on the experimental trial
and

143
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,310
there's no natural kind of control group,

144
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,180
you might want to pick the highest risk
group.

145
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,090
If you want to show protective effects.

146
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,760
So like if you want to show that
something,

147
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,790
if the message of your paper is that
something is protective,

148
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,410
you would choose the highest, the group
with the highest risk.

149
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:09,460
So that your odds ratios all come out to
be below 1, it shows a protective effect.

150
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,400
Or if you want to show something's
harmful, you'd pick the lowest risk group

151
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,010
as your reference group, so that your odds
ratios all come out above 1.

152
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,000
And this again is,

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,840
just has to do with the message that you
present at the end of the day.

154
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,230
But it's an important choice, so

155
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,800
you want to think about what makes the
best reference group.
