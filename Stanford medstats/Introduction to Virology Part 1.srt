1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,370
This presentation is an introduction to
virology.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,040
At the end of the presentation you should
be able to name the structural components

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,360
of viruses, describe the different types
of viral genomes and how these replicate.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,710
Recall the basis for classifying viral
families and explain viral life cycle.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,440
So with regards to some of the
nomenclature,

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,110
the keywords are highlighted in red.

7
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,650
first, it's important to recognize that
viruses require living cells for

8
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,290
their survival and for their replication.

9
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,790
They cannot exis, exist on their own.

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,040
They're not free living creatures but

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,530
rather they're obligate intracellular
pathogens.

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,420
A viral infectious particle is referred to
as a virion and

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,850
this virion is the viral genome encased a
capsid protein coat.

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:01,030
The capsid's vary in shape and some of the
shapes are outlined on this slide and

15
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:06,580
these capsids are composed of structural
proteins called capsomeres.

16
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:12,790
The capsomeres are specified by the viral
genome and they are antigenically unique.

17
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,070
Many viruses are surrounded by a
lipoprotein membrane envelope and

18
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,820
that envelope may have glycoproteins
embedded within it.

19
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,480
These viral glycoproteins facilitate the
attachment of the virus to a host cell and

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,140
the release of the virus from that host
cell.

21
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,800
An example of a viral structure is
illustrated with this dna virus,

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,620
this DNA Herpes virus.

23
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,240
Where you can see at the core of the
virus, the viral genome.

24
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,910
That genome is surrounded by the Capsids,
and in turn,

25
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:54,790
the Capsids, which make up the Capsomere,
are surrounded by an outer protein

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:00,990
membrane and, embedded within this
membrane are the Herpes glycol proteins.

27
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,560
Viral genomes are either DNA or they're
RNA and most

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,220
viruses have one copy of either the DNA or
RNA and they're referred to as haploid.

29
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,050
Retroviruses are an exception to this,
they're diploid.

30
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,460
They have two identical copies of RNA.

31
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,010
The genomic structure varies from virus to
virus.

32
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,700
They may be double-stranded.

33
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,090
You can see the abbreviation, single
stranded, or

34
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,250
any partially double stranded and RNA
viruses may be either positive, or

35
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,660
negative sense, and I'll explain that in a
moment.

36
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,480
Genome structures may be either segmented
or non-segmented and

37
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,350
this is important in the ability of
viruses, some viruses to evolve.

38
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:52,950
The genomes also may vary from being
linear, to circular, to partial circular.

39
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,740
And finally, many viruses carry their own
enzymes to facilitate their replication or

40
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,340
to perform other functions.

41
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,500
There are about 20 major viral families
they're referred to as viridae,

42
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,530
that have been associated with human
disease.

43
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,120
And these viral families are classified
according to a number of characteristics.

44
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,210
I've already alluded to one of the
characteristics, whether they're

45
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:24,600
DNA viruses or RNA viruses, and also as to
their strandedness,

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,799
double stranded, single stranded or they
may be partially double stranded.

47
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,760
Their so called sense of their nucleic
acid.

48
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,570
Whether they are negative sense, positive
sense, or they're ambivalent,

49
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,990
they have ambisense.

50
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,940
I'll come back to this.

51
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,970
The capsid shape as mentioned earlier,

52
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:49,040
may also vary and the viruses may have an
envelope or they may lack an envelope.

53
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,390
The genomes may be segmented or
non-segmented, and the physical appearance

54
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,210
of the virus, if you happen to own an
electron microscope, will vary.

55
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,740
Also the size of the virion itself, or

56
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:06,370
the size of the viral genome varies, and
finally, the nature of gene expression.

57
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,270
So these are all different characteristics
that allows one to

58
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,992
assign viruses into different families.

59
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:18,410
We're going to start by talking about the
DNA viruses, and this is not a table,

60
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,940
this is not a table to be memorized, but
rather outlines the key

61
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,590
families of DNA viruses and you can see
that there are seven.

62
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,750
And they vary according to whether they
are double stranded or single stranded.

63
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,000
They vary according to their genome shape.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,140
They vary according to where they
replicate in host cells and

65
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,920
their type of capsids and some examples of
the viruses in these different

66
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,990
families are shown on the far right and
some of these you will be familiar with.

67
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,220
Hepatitis B virus, a major cause of liver
infection,

68
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,070
liver cancer and liver cirrhosis in the
word.

69
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,140
Herpes simplex virus, the cause of cold
sores.

70
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,050
Small pox virus which has been eradicated
but

71
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,380
nonetheless is feared as a weapon of mass
destruction.

72
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,720
Human papilloma viruses for which we now
have a vaccine.

73
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,650
And then viruses that cause infections
primarily in an immunocompromised hosts.

74
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,480
This picture is to try to display the DNA
viruses in a simpler fashion

75
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,600
that is they may, depending upon their
envelope, nonenveloped vs enveloped.

76
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,300
Depending upon their strandedness, single,
double, or double stranded circular.

77
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,390
And that applies to both the enveloped and

78
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,380
the nonenveloped and some examples at the
bottom.

79
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,150
Again, this is not, to be memorized, but

80
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,530
rather just to appreciate the general
family structure of the DNA viruses.

81
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,030
With regards to the RNA viruses the
genomes may be

82
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,923
either positive-sense or negative-sense.

83
00:05:55,923 --> 00:06:02,350
A positive-sense RNA virus means that the
the virus,

84
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,070
the positive-sense segment acts as
messenger RNA and

85
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,130
can be directly translated after it's
entered host cells.

86
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,580
If an RNA genome is negative-sense they
actually have to carry an enzyme,

87
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,632
an RNA dependent RNA polymerase that turns
the negative-sense RNA

88
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:26,100
into positive-sense RNA before it can be
translated.

89
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,250
Many RNA viruses have a segmented genome
and this is very important because it

90
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,380
means that the virus can mix and match by
its genome shifting.

91
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,290
Because it's segmented it can break apart
an recombine with something else.

92
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,980
This will be especially important with
influenza viruses.

93
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,420
Most RNA viruses replicate in the
cytoplasm, although there are exceptions,

94
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:56,090
shown parenthetically and most RN, are,
RNA viruses are sti, single stranded.

95
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,000
That there's an exception to that as well.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,420
The accompanying table illustrates the
fourteen viral

97
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:09,260
families bodily speaking with some
specific examples of the family members.

98
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,780
According to the name of the family.

99
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,040
And this picture like the one for DNA
viruses, is meant to simplify the class of

100
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,710
occasion of RNA viruses between those that
are nonenveloped and

101
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,460
those that are enveloped, based upon their
strandedness and

102
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,790
also based upon whether their positive
sense or negative sense.

103
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:32,280
Again, not to be memorized but rather to
be appreciated.

104
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,740
With regards to viral pathogenesis, a
virus' cycle and

105
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,940
in, in a very similar way.

106
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,400
They enter the body and they attach to a
host cell.

107
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,650
They then enter the host cell.

108
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,100
They're uncoated if they have a coat.

109
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:55,580
They replicate, and then they rely upon
host cells,

110
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,240
and sometimes their own enzymes, in order
to create progeny, and

111
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,900
then can be released so that they can go
on and infect.

112
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,340
Other cells.

113
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,830
Schematically this is represented on this
picture.

114
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:14,140
With, at the top, showing the virus
binding to the host cell.

115
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,830
When it comes into the host cell, it, the
virion is released,

116
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,200
the genome is released and there us
ultimately replication and

117
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,500
translation of the virus so that progeny
genome can be made, and

118
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,990
the virus ultimately can be repackaged and
released as progeny to infect other cells.
