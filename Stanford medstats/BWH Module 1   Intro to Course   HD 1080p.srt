00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:27,390
>> Hi, I'm Dr Larry Chu.

3
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,890
>> Hi, I'm Dr Lauren Cornella.

4
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,550
>> And I'm Dr John Fox.

5
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,250
>> Welcome to this course on An
Introduction to Cardiac Anesthesia.

6
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,070
Now, the first thing I want to let you
know is that this is a priming course.

7
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,700
It's not meant to help you achieve
proficiency in cardiac anesthesia.

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,210
Because of course,

9
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,275
that's what you're going to learn when you
take your cardiac anesthesia rotation.

10
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:53,200
Now, what we hope is that this online
course can help be a primer or

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,000
an introduction to the field of cardiac
anesthesia,

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,910
that you can take before your cardiac
anesthesia rotation.

13
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,440
So that when you begin your cardiac
anesthesia rotation, you can hit

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,350
the ground running and that you have some
basic understanding of what you'll be

15
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,960
doing and what you'll be learning through
your time on cardiac anesthesia.

16
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,541
So Lauren, can you tell the students a
little bit about what they might expect to

17
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:16,562
learn in this course?

18
00:01:16,562 --> 00:01:17,660
>> Sure.

19
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,880
I think this course will offer you a
really good introduction to the basics of

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,240
cardiac anesthesia.

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,820
I think there are a lot of things about
your cardiac anesthesia rotation that

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,780
are different from what you might have
done in previous rotations.

23
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,520
There's a lot of different pharmacology, a
lot of different physiology.

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,490
Different lines,

25
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,830
different monitors different machines that
you might not have had exposure to before.

26
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,100
So I think with this course,

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,750
you'll be given a primer to some of the
things you might see in the cardiac ORs,

28
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,150
some of the drugs that you might use, some
of the physiology and pharmacology.

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,090
And I think that you'll be given an
introduction, so that you'll feel

30
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,990
a little bit more comfortable on the first
day of your cardiac anesthesia rotation.

31
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,710
>> Wonderful.

32
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,059
So, John, tell me what are your thoughts
about what students can get out of

33
00:01:59,059 --> 00:01:59,705
this course?

34
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:05,243
>> Well, Dr. Chu, in the years that I've
taught cardiac anesthesia, I've

35
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:12,060
found residents have been very, sometimes
apprehensive to start the rotation.

36
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,780
And that's, as Lauren has said,

37
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,830
because of a lot of new environment, new
monitors, new equipment.

38
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,480
New staff and

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,810
sometimes also because of the intensity of
what goes on in the cardiac room.

40
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,410
These patients are very ill and sometimes
they don't do well.

41
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,680
And that is something that people have to
sort of address to, or adjust.

42
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,890
additionally, one good thing that they
will learn in the cardiac

43
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,680
anesthesia rotation is the concept of
teamwork.

44
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,180
One person once told me that cardiac
anesthesia and

45
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,410
cardiac surgery is the ultimate team
sport.

46
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,140
There are a variety of individuals who are
involved in this,

47
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,490
including nursing, profusion, surgeons,
and the anesthesia team.

48
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,650
Additionally, you'll learn about
checklists.

49
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,210
And the years that I,

50
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,230
even before checklists became popular, we
were doing checklists in it.

51
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,430
And that's part of things that you'll
learn in addition to the other procedures.

52
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,519
Once you learn cardiac anesthesia, the
lessons you learn, and

53
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,742
the medications you learn, and the comfort
you get in dealing with ill patients,

54
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:20,910
you can take into the care of patients in
the other aspects of the operating room.

55
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,000
>> Well I think those are all great
points.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,165
And our goal in this course is to help
prepare you for this great experience.

57
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:30,355
I think you know,

58
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:34,808
personally speaking, after I completed my
cardiac anesthesia rotation, I felt so

59
00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:39,010
much more comfortable dealing with the
hypotensive patient, or patients with

60
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,340
cardiovascular disease, evaluating
cardiovascular functions in patients for

61
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,194
pre-operative the preoperative assessment
for patients undergoing surgery.

62
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,817
And so I, I agree.

63
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:54,222
I think there are so many lifelong lessons
that you'll take with you after you

64
00:03:54,222 --> 00:03:56,460
complete cardiac anesthesia.

65
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,920
And it's really our honor to help start
you on that journey.

66
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,412
So, let's get started.

67
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:11,412
