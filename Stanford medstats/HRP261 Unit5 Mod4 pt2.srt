1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,200
Okay, so just one more example, actually
from the medical literature of some

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,170
authors who applied principle components
analysis, a really nice interesting study.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,100
This was a, a dietary study, and they were
looking for

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,260
dietary patterns that predicted breast
cancer risk.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,530
And this is a great cohort of data,
there's a big cohort of,

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,150
information collected on women, California
teachers studied,

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,520
I think it was mostly women, a cohort of
118,000 women.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,654
They measured, food frequency, they sent
them food frequency questionnaires,

9
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:33,860
measured to a bunch of dietary variables.

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,110
How many apples do you eat per day?

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,230
How many fish do you eat per day?

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,640
And things like that.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,280
Well, that becomes an unwieldy data set.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,810
We have to use it some how and extract the
useful information, so

15
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,180
they apply principal components analysis
to identify dietary patterns.

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,430
That is, again people who tend to eat a
lot of, you know, apples probably also eat

17
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,910
a lot of broccoli and probably also eat a
lot of peaches, because people you know,

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,165
just, you know, some people eat a lot of
fruits and vegetables.

19
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:01,745
People who eat a lot of cookies probably
also eat a lot of bread and

20
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:02,750
and things like that.

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,452
So they're going to extract these dietary
patterns and then try to relate them to

22
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:10,160
perspectively to breast cancer risks with
a cohort study.

23
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,860
We're just going to now show you actually
directly from the methods section.

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,623
Sorry, It's actually maybe a little fuzzy,
'because I took it from a screenshot, but

25
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:19,955
I really like their, they [UNKNOWN] nice
to say,

26
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,029
I also teach writing and they had a nice
succicnt clear description of

27
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:26,527
how they prefer the principal components
analysis in their method section and

28
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:29,700
it also covers a lot of the things that we
just talked about.

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,778
So first of all, each variable was
standardized to a mean of zero and

30
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:33,655
a variance of one.

31
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:37,870
I told you, you need to do that before
applying principal components analysis.

32
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,100
Then a coefficient was assigned to each
variable depending on the weight

33
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,660
it contributed to the principal component.

34
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,660
So that's just the,

35
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,530
what we just talked about going through a
principal component analysis.

36
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,150
How are principle component variables
actually calculated?

37
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,560
Factor scores for each subject for each
dietary pattern were calculated by

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,620
multiplying the participant's consumption
of each food or beverage by the weight,

39
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,090
the factor loading given to that food or
beverage for that dietary pattern and

40
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,720
summing those values for all foods and
beverages.

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,030
So that's just telling you, you take
those, those weights again,

42
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,240
you multiply by the individual variables,
add them up.

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,600
And you get for each woman,

44
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,060
you're going to get a score for each
dietary pattern.

45
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,390
An orthogonal varimax rotation procedure
was used to

46
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,940
obtain uncorrelated components.

47
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,960
So again, we applied that so it was easier
to to figure out what

48
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,430
those variables mean and it guarantees
that they're uncorrelated components.

49
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,990
The number of factors retained was based
on eigenvalues of less, greater than or

50
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,530
equal to one.

51
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,890
So that's the eigenvalue of criteria I
talked about.

52
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,450
As well as examination of scree plots,
which I also talked about,

53
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,654
and factor interpretability, so again you
know it's study dependent [UNKNOWN], so

54
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:42,320
it's also a nice little description of all
the things that we just talked about.

55
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,070
So when they did all this and came out
with their principle components they

56
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,650
ended up with five principle components,
five dietary patterns that they found.

57
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,400
I guess that all of these, you know, the
eigenvalues were greater than one and

58
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,230
they decided to, these are the only ones
they decided to retain,

59
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,660
'because they are the predominate ones in
this data set.

60
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,049
So they found a plant based diet, so this
is women eat a lot of fruits and

61
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,800
vegetables, that's a one dietary pattern
they, they saw.

62
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:10,400
They found a high protein, high fat
dietary pattern.

63
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,430
So these are people eating a lot of meats,
eggs, fried foods, high fat condiments,

64
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,545
probably eating a lot of fast foods.

65
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:20,040
A high carbo diet, a hard carbohydrate
diet pattern, which is

66
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,400
high inconvenience foods like you know
pre-processed cookies, pasta and bread.

67
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,920
Ethnic diet which has a lot of beans, soy,
dark green leafy vegetables,

68
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,178
rice might represent other di,

69
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:34,090
diets in another cultures and then finally
I love this, the salad and

70
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,090
wine diet which was high in lettuce and
salad dress, low-fat salad dressing.

71
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,630
Fish and wine, coffee and tea and I think
I, I identified, I'd probably get

72
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,880
a high score on that particular dietary
pattern, so but unfortunately that's

73
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,990
the one that got linked to breast cancer
probably because of the wine.

74
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,530
But anyway you,

75
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,000
you see these kind of interesting patterns
that emerged and it's actually hard to

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,950
put on a whole screen all of the
information that they put in their paper,

77
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,800
there's a rather big table where they show
the factor loadings from a princi-,

78
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,790
principal components analysis for all the
different food and vegetables that,

79
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,670
that foods and beverages that were on
their food frequency questionnaire.

80
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,350
These are pretty short food frequency
questionnaires,

81
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,910
that we are able to show this all in one
table.

82
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,630
So here is all the, you know, kind of
fruits and vegetables.

83
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,060
Well, those all loaded highly together in
this plant-based diet.

84
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,760
And they show up to the point where, you
get to a factor loading of 0.35 and above.

85
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,630
And then they just didn't bother, that
there are some,

86
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,750
there's little factor loadings here,

87
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,180
which they're not zero, but they didn't
bother to show them after that point.

88
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,150
Because these are the primary ones that
loaded on this component.

89
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,054
So all of the fruits and vegetables, not
surprisingly.

90
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:40,012
And then we can keep going, I won't go
through this whole table, but

91
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:43,327
the high protein, high fat diet had a lot
of butter, beef, sausage, pork,

92
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:45,430
hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fried chicken.

93
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:53,687
You know, the, the, what they call the,
the high carbohydrate had a lot of pizza,

94
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:58,010
tortillas, spaghetti, bagels, things like
that.

95
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:03,477
The, the what they call the ethic diet
beans, tofu, vegetable soups, rice,

96
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:05,730
meat substitutes and so on.

97
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,260
And then finally you get the salad and
wine diet.

98
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,970
So the green salad, fish, wine, salad
dressing or even a lot of salads,

99
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,950
coffee and tea, tomatoes that was all the,
the wine and salad diet.

100
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,840
So you can see, these, these are the
variables, the,

101
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,450
the foods that clustered in each one of
these dietary patterns.

102
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,280
And then they took these dietary patterns,
so every woman gets a score for

103
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,078
each dietary pattern.

104
00:05:30,078 --> 00:05:33,040
So you maybe high in more than one dietary
pattern, or

105
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,800
you may have one that predominates.

106
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,320
They took these scores and they divided
them into quantiles.

107
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,945
So one, two, three, four,

108
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:44,260
five [UNKNOWN] the quintile of scores on
each of these dietary patterns.

109
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,990
And then they try to relate that to breast
cancer risk.

110
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,212
This was actually using Cox Regression
because it was a perspective study.

111
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:55,150
So they're calculating hazard ratios, so
not logistic regression, but same idea.

112
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,668
And we end up with hazard ratios or
relative risks at the end of the day.

113
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:00,110
There's something here called a p trend,

114
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,540
which we're going to talk about in a few
modules from now.

115
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,990
But you can see that, but unfortunately
the salad and

116
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,660
wine diet was linked to a higher risk of a
particular type of breast cancer,

117
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,385
estrogen positive, progesterone positive
breast cancer.

118
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:16,340
There probably has a lot to do with the
fact that we know that

119
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,660
alcohol actually increases your risk of
breast cancer and if you're on a salad and

120
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,950
wine diet, you're probably having a, a
reasonable amount of alcohol.
