1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,420
In this next module,

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,860
we're going to look at another measure of
association called the relative risks.

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,870
Instead of subtracting the risks in the
different groups,

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,020
what if we instead divided them to make a
ratio, that's called a relative risk.

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,510
There are several measures of relative
risk and

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,560
relative risks appear very frequently in
the medical literature.

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,320
If you take two incidents rates and divide
them, that's called a rate ratio.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,840
You'll also see something in the
literature called a hazard ratio.

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,530
A hazard ratio is also a ratio of
incidence rates.

10
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,300
It's just a ratio of what we call
instantaneous incidence rates or

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,940
hazard rates.

12
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,040
Hazard ratios actually come from a
regression technique that we're

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,995
going to talk about much later in the
course.

14
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:53,430
But for now,

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,330
you can just interpret them exactly the
same way you would interpret a rate ratio.

16
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,130
If you divide two cumulative risks, or two
prevalences, we call that a risk ratio.

17
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:11,150
Now some people might call the ratio of
two prevalences a prevalence ratio,

18
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,070
to distinguish it, but I tend to lump them
together and call them

19
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,266
all a risk ratio because cumulative risks
and prevalences are both just proportions.

20
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:24,314
Another measure of relative risk I'm going
to talk about a great deal this week is

21
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:26,243
something called an odds ratio.

22
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:29,660
An odds ratio is a ratio of two odds and
I'm going to have to tell you what

23
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,740
an odds is in a minute because you may not
really understand what an odds is already.

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,270
But the odds ratio comes up a lot in the
medical literature for two reasons.

25
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,030
The odds ratio is the only value measure
of relative risk for case control studies.

26
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,330
That's one reason.

27
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,750
The other reason that odds ratios come up
a lot, is that a lot

28
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,870
of researchers want to do a regression
technique called logistic regression.

29
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,240
It's a multivariate regression technique
that's used when you

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,040
have a binary outcome, and you want to
adjust for confounders.

31
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,690
It turns out that logistic regression
gives you out odds ratios.

32
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,511
So even if you're doing a covert study, or
a cross sectional study,

33
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:07,270
if you use logistic regression, you're
going to get out odds ratios.

34
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,780
So, odds ratios are all over the
literature.

35
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,070
But as we're going to see in this module
and the next module,

36
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:19,425
they're a little bit of a funny measure
and sometimes they're tricky to interpret.

37
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:23,260
[BLANK_AUDIO]
So how do we interpret relative risk?

38
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,430
So the rate ratio and the hazard ratio,

39
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,880
you can interpret as the percent increase
or decrease in the rate of the outcome.

40
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,110
The risk ratio is the percent increase or
decrease in the risk or

41
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,505
prevalence of the outcome.

42
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:38,890
The odds ratio is the percent increase or
decrease in the odds of the outcome, and

43
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,572
again I'll fill you in on what an odds is
in a minute.

44
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:47,640
If you have a relative risk that's equal
to 1.0,

45
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,430
that means that the risks in the two
groups are equal,

46
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,925
because, say if the risk is 20% in one
group and

47
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:57,460
20% in the other group, if you divide 20%
by 20% you're going to get 1.0.

48
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,490
So that represents where there's no
difference between the groups,

49
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,980
we call that the null value.

50
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,530
If you have a relative risk that's less
than one,

51
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,300
that indicates a protective effect.

52
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,190
Whatever was in the numerator is
protecting you from the outcome.

53
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,380
If you have a relative risk that's greater
than one, that indicates a harmful effect,

54
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,220
an increased risk.

55
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,110
Let's calculate the rate ratio first
starting with

56
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,670
the GI event data from the Vioxx study
we've been talking about.

57
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,360
Incident rates were 2.1 and 4.5 again.

58
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,009
All we have to do here to make a rate
ratio is to

59
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,820
divide the two incidents rates.

60
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,700
And notice because we're dividing two
rates, the units here,

61
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,860
the 100 person-years actually cancels out.

62
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,730
And the rate ratio doesn't have any units,
it's unitless.

63
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,930
We come out with a rate ratio of 0.46.

64
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:49,100
The interpretation is that Vioxx reduces
the rate of GI events by 54%.

65
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,900
I got that 54% simply by subtracting 1
minus 0.46.

66
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,210
So that's a 40, 54% reduction in the rate
of GI events.

67
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,060
If I want to calculate the risk ratio for
this same data, I'm just

68
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,410
going to divide the risk in the Vioxx
group by the risk in the Naproxen group.

69
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,770
Interestingly I get exactly the same a
number here, 0.46.

70
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:14,080
So in this case the rate ratio and the
risk ratio are identical because,

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,748
remember, the person-years of follow up
was exactly the same in both groups.

72
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:22,040
So, if you're following people for the
same amount of time and the risk ratio and

73
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,760
the weight ration would come out to be the
same.

74
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,740
However, if there was a differential
follow up

75
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,120
between the groups then this wouldn't be
the case.

76
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,990
Because if one group was followed for
longer than the other group,

77
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,530
that would increase the risk in the group
that was followed longer, and

78
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,790
it would change the risk ratio compared
with the, the rate ratio.

79
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,520
Now I want to read to you what they put in
the pay, in the paper's abstract.

80
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,490
During a median follow-up of 9 months,

81
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,210
2.1 confirmed GI events per 100
patient-years occurred with the rofecoxib,

82
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,020
that is the Vioxx group, as compared with
4.5 per 100 patient years with naproxen.

83
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,180
Now they're going to give the relative
risk.

84
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,850
The relative risk is 0.5 so they rounded
up from 0.46 to, to 0.5.

85
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:07,260
95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.6 and
it's highly statistically significant.

86
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,120
I want to spend just a minute here to walk
you through what that

87
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,230
confidence interval means.

88
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,100
We're going to spend a lot of time on
confidence intervals in an upcoming week

89
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,620
of the course.

90
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,420
But I want to just give you sort of a
conceptual understanding of

91
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,110
what that confidence interval means here.

92
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,550
So the relative risk that we calculated in
the study,

93
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,630
what we call the point estimate.

94
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,730
What we calculated in the study was
exactly 0.46 rounded up to .5.

95
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,220
So that indicates a halving of risk.

96
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,780
But that's just what we saw in the study.

97
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,730
And of course,

98
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,980
whenever we do a study, we know that
there's going to be some uncertainty.

99
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,600
In other words the true effect of Vioxx on
GI events might not be exactly 0.5.

100
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,860
We understand that when we do a study,
there's uncertainty.

101
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,750
We have to put a margin of error around
our estimate.

102
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,310
That margin of error is what we call the
95% confidence interval.

103
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,230
So the 95% confidence interval here is 0.3
to 0.6.

104
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,580
That gives us a plausible range of values
for the true effect.

105
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,830
The real effect of Vioxx on on GI events
we believe is

106
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,570
somewhere between 0.3 and 0.6.

107
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,280
Another way to interpret it is we say we
can be 95% confident that

108
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,569
the true effect of Vioxx verus naproxen is
between a 40% and

109
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:21,600
70% reduction in the rate of GI events.

110
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,290
Where did that 40% and 70% come from?

111
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,620
The upper limit of the confidence interval
is a relative risk of 0.6.

112
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,080
That's a 40% reduction in risk.

113
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,476
The lower limit in the confidence interval
is a relative risk of 0.3.

114
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:37,570
That's a 70% reduction in risk.

115
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,160
Now let's move to the heart attack data
from the study.

116
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,150
What's the rate ratio going to be here.

117
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,970
The rate ratio will be the rate in the
Vioxx group divided by the rate in

118
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,740
the Naproxen group.

119
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,350
When you do that division it comes out to
be 4.2, if the risk ratio is

120
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,150
actually identical, as I said before,
because the groups should follow for

121
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,580
equal amounts of time.

122
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,420
The risk ration and the rate ratio are the
same.

123
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,660
How do we interpret these results?

124
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,810
We would interpret this that Vioxx
increases the rate or

125
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:10,890
risk of heart attacks by fourfold, or you
would say by 320%.

126
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,019
But let's see what the authors actually
put in the abstract here.

127
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,370
So, here's the abstract from the paper.

128
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,010
The incidence of myocardial infarction,
heart attack,

129
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,035
was lower among patients in the naproxen
group than among those in the Vioxx group.

130
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:27,940
0.1% versus 0.4%.

131
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,580
We already saw that number in the last
module.

132
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:37,240
Relative risk 0.2, 95% confidence
interval, 0.1 to 0.7.

133
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,590
So notice that when the authors reported
the data on GI events,

134
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,660
they put the naproxen in the denominator.

135
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,710
They put the naproxen as the reference
group,

136
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,170
but when they report the data on heart
attacks, they're flipping things around.

137
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,550
They're making Vioxx the reference group.

138
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,300
They're putting Vioxx in the denominator.

139
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,110
And you can probably think of the reason
that they might have wanted to do that.

140
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,220
So there are actually two funny things
going on here,

141
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,150
as I alluded to in the last module.

142
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,160
So firstly, they reported risks rather
than rates.

143
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,840
For the primary outcome GI events,
remember they

144
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,760
actually reported the incidence rates,
they reported the risks here,

145
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,270
likely because the risk difference here
looks smaller than the rate difference.

146
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,450
Secondly, they flipped the relative risk.

147
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,100
They divided the risk in the Naproxen
group by the risk in

148
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,530
the Vioxx group rather than the other way
around.

149
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,110
So remember the risk in the Vioxx group
was 0.42.

150
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,100
The risk in the Naproxen group is 0.1.

151
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,630
If you divide 0.1 by 0.42 you get a
relative risk of 0.24 and

152
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,100
they rounded down in the abstract to 0.2.

153
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,260
They rounded to one decimal place.

154
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,970
So they twisted the message here, right.

155
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:48,990
They twisted the message to make it look
like naproxen is protective rather than

156
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,390
that Vioxx is harmful.

157
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,620
And technically, they haven't done
anything wrong mathematically.

158
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,530
The numbers are correct.

159
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,440
But flipping the relative risk of course
completely shifts the take home message,

160
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,380
and people missed it.

161
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,150
Not one person wrote a letter to the
editor of the New England Journal,

162
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,820
after this article was published,
questioning the author's logic here.

163
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,920
People bought into the story that the
authors were trying to sell,

164
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,440
that Naproxen is this miracle heart
protective drug.

165
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,590
Instead of that Vioxx is a dangerous drug.

166
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,980
Here's the, what they wrote in the paper's
conclusion.

167
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,800
I showed you this in the teaser earlier.

168
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,850
Thus, our results are consistent with the
theory that Naproxen has

169
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,550
a coronary protective effect.

170
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,590
And highlight the fact that rofecoxib
Vioxx does not provide this

171
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,290
type of protection.

172
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,900
The finding that naproxen therapy was
associated with a lower rate of

173
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,740
myocardial infarction needs further
confirmation in larger studies.

174
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,220
Of course, naproxen is the reference
group, the control group in this study.

175
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,292
So every comparison really outta be Vioxx
versus naproxen,

176
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:50,730
not naproxen versus Vioxx.

177
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,350
But they totally put the focus on naproxen
to take the focus away from Vioxx and

178
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,540
it worked.

179
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,920
In fact it turns out that naproxen has a
very small,

180
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,760
if any cardio protective affect.

181
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,980
So here was clear evidence sitting in the
literature in 2000 that Vioxx raises

182
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,590
the risk of cardiovascular events.

183
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,260
Some people think that if if people had
actually looked at this study more

184
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,350
carefully and kind of questioned the
reasoning of the authors here,

185
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,960
that Vioxx might have actually been pulled
off the shelves sooner than 2004.

186
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,692
The data were sitting here showing us that
there's this

187
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:29,660
cardio harmful effect of nap, of Vioxx.

188
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,280
And there's actually a lot of backstory
here that I'm not telling you.

189
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,010
There was actually some data omitted from
the New England Journal of Med,

190
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,650
of Medicine paper.

191
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,840
If you're interested in all of this,

192
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,620
you can Google it, you can find out more
about this story.

193
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,770
People made a big deal about the fact that
some of the heart,

194
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,590
actually three heart attacks that probably
should have been included in

195
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,660
that New England Journal paper that
weren't.

196
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,600
But in fact,

197
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,680
that data that was already available in
the paper really told the whole story.

198
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,950
It's just that the authors had managed to
spin that story and people bought it.

199
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,740
So the bigger lesson here, is that it's
very important when

200
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,925
you're reading a medical paper to always
look at the data yourself.

201
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:06,980
And then interpret the data yourself.

202
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,800
Because you allow the authors to lead you
through their interpretation of the data,

203
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,960
you can easily get sucked into the story
they want to tell you.

204
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,530
And that's what happened here.
