1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,420
So this first question of the third

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:10,492
homework assignment we're given a
probability question.

3
00:00:10,492 --> 00:00:19,220
So, in 1980, there were about 3.6 million
births and of which 68,339 were to twins.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:26,350
And 1,337 were due to triplets or more.

5
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,290
Okay?

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,682
So, the first part of this question is
asking you about the probability of

7
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:35,110
having multiples or more in 1980.

8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,262
So, that is just going to be the number of
twins plus the number of

9
00:00:40,262 --> 00:00:46,089
triplets divided by the total number of
births.

10
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:54,620
Then, if we do this math out, that's
going to give us about 1.93%.

11
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,650
So that's the probability of having
multiples or more in 1980.

12
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,250
So that number's going to be used in the
next few questions.

13
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,220
So I'm going to save that number.

14
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,740
I'm going to rewrite it up here in the
corner, so we don't forget.

15
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,420
So let's take a look at the next part of
this question.

16
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,664
So the next part of this question reads,

17
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:21,850
what was the probability of a woman giving
birth to multiples twice in a row?

18
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:27,250
Okay so if the probability of giving birth
to multiples is 1.93%,

19
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:34,445
having that happen twice in a row is just
1.93 times o1.93.

20
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:35,710
Okay?

21
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:41,600
And that's just going to be 0.00037.

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,530
So this is probability of getting
multiples twice in a row.

23
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,900
Another way of printing that is to say
0.037%.

24
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,148
So the last part of this question reads if
a woman had 10 births in her

25
00:01:57,148 --> 00:02:02,975
lifetime what was the chance that at least
one of those births was to multiples?

26
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:03,506
Okay.
And

27
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:08,370
we know this is an at least question
because of the wording in the stem.

28
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,450
And I'd just like to remind you that for
these at least questions, right, the trick

29
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,530
is to realize that the probability of the
event happening at least once is equal to

30
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,085
1 minus the probability of the event not
happening at all.

31
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:23,110
Okay.

32
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,260
So, the probability of having multiples in
one birth,

33
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,250
we know from the first part of this
question, is 1.93%.

34
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:36,954
So therefore, the probability of having no
multiples,

35
00:02:36,954 --> 00:02:43,190
right, is 1 minus 1.93% or 0.9807.

36
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,330
Okay?
And then, so

37
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:51,491
that's going to be 10 births, so what we
want to do is raise this number to the 10.

38
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:55,047
[SOUND] And that's going to give us
0.8229.

39
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:58,428
Of course, then the last thing we want to
do because this

40
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,292
number represents the probability of no
multiples over 10 births,

41
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:09,805
we want to do 1 minus that to get at least
one multiple, okay, for over 10 births.

42
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:16,330
We're going to do one minus 0.8229 to get
17.7%.

43
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,502
Okay.

44
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:21,417
So if a woman gives birth 10 times the
probability that

45
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:26,779
she's going to have multiples at least
once is 17.7%.

46
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:31,597
So the second question reads suppose that
the probability of surviving for

47
00:03:31,597 --> 00:03:36,670
five years, after being diagnosed with a
cancer, is 0.6.

48
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,895
And the probability of surviving for 10
years [SOUND] is 0.2.

49
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:44,356
Okay?

50
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:46,005
That's a pretty bad cancer.

51
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:47,716
So if a person survives five years,

52
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:51,420
what's the probability that she will
survive ten years?

53
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,390
So you notice this is a Bayes' Rule
problem because it's asking for

54
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,430
conditional probability.

55
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,212
So, conditioned on the fact that the
patient already survived five years,

56
00:04:00,212 --> 00:04:04,915
what's the probability that the patient's
going to survive 10 years?

57
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:08,244
Okay?
That's one way of rephrasing the problem.

58
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:13,411
So I'm going to write this in the notation
the Bayes' Rule notation.

59
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:18,706
It's the probability of surviving 10
years, given each survived 5 years.

60
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:19,517
Okay?
And so

61
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:25,910
Bayes' Rule says that we can find the
answer by using a handy-dandy formula.

62
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,560
Okay?
And

63
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,623
I can just substitute in these values, so
we know this is going to be 0.2.

64
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:35,209
We know this is going to be 0.6.

65
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:39,070
And the probability of surviving five
years if

66
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,231
you've survived ten years of course is
100%.

67
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:45,778
So 100% times 0.24 or

68
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:52,650
1 really, times 0.2, divided by 0.6 is
going to give us about 33%.

69
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,065
So given that you've survived five years,

70
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:59,560
the probability that you're going to
surive ten years is 33%.

71
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,685
It increases from this number.

72
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:02,608
[SOUND] Okay.

73
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:07,088
So in this third question on the third
homework assignment, we're given,

74
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:10,727
we're provided with a table.

75
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,150
This is responders, non-responders and
test positive, test negative.

76
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,700
What is this all about?

77
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,220
So basically there's a new diagnostic
test,

78
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,323
and to test the parameters of this test
researchers conducted an experiment where

79
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:28,746
there were 59 known non-responders and 72
known responders.

80
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,818
And basically, they're given this
diagnostic test to

81
00:05:31,818 --> 00:05:34,410
see how accurate this test was.

82
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,594
So this is sort of a typical sensitivity,
specificity,

83
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:38,740
positive predictive value type problem.

84
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,575
It's important to know before you start
these things,

85
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:47,301
that if you want to apply the formulas
given for, let's say, sensitivity.

86
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:51,201
For example, when given a contingency
table like this, if you search for

87
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:54,321
sensitivity on the internet, you're
going to see a lot of

88
00:05:54,321 --> 00:06:00,280
resources saying sensitivity is simply
equal to a over a plus c.

89
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,496
And while that, while that is true in this
situation, you have to be very careful in

90
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:08,836
applying this formula because this only
works when this is the gold standard, or

91
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:12,740
what's considered true.

92
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,850
And this is the diagnostic test.

93
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,272
Okay?
A lot of times,

94
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:21,095
there are 2 by 2 tables given that have
exposure on this side,

95
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:28,670
exposure yes, exposure no, and cases and
controls over here.

96
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:34,085
So in that situation, you can't just do a
over a plus c as the sensitivity.

97
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:37,190
So first question, what is the
sensitivity?

98
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,372
So, as I said, it's simply 10 over 10 plus
49.

99
00:06:41,372 --> 00:06:42,740
OK.
10 over 59 and

100
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,281
that's going to be equal to 17%.

101
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,350
17% is the sensitivity.

102
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,060
Next part of this question, what's the
specificity?

103
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,240
Okay, specificity is just this number over
the total.

104
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:01,940
So it's 63 over 72, and that's going to be
equal to approximately 88%.

105
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,660
The specificity of this test is
approximately 88%.

106
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,960
Then the next part of this question is
asking about applying this test to

107
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,040
the general population.

108
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,431
We know that the prevalence of testing
positive for this test is about 50%.

109
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:22,697
So we want to use this information to
calculate a positive predictive value.

110
00:07:22,697 --> 00:07:23,323
Okay?
And so

111
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:27,420
in order to do this, we're going to need
to apply Bayes' formula.

112
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:33,400
We cannot calculate the positive
predictive value directly from this.

113
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,310
Okay.
So, Bayes' formula can be set up

114
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,440
like this.

115
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:44,800
So, the probability of being resistant to
the antibiotic given the test is positive.

116
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,524
[SOUND] Okay.
Equals the probability of

117
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:50,628
testing positive given that you're
resistant, okay, multiplied by

118
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:58,030
the probability of being resistant, over
the probability of testing positive.

119
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,050
Great.
So we can fill these in.

120
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,360
So this is going to just be 17%.

121
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,071
We calculated that earlier.

122
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:11,897
This is going to be 15%, this is given in
the question stem.

123
00:08:11,897 --> 00:08:18,180
We know that the prevalence of resistance
among the general population is 50%.

124
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,850
And then lastly [SOUND] this part about
the probability of testing positive.

125
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,960
Well we can use an expanded formula to
calculate that.

126
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,748
So that's going to be the sensitivity of
the test times the prevalence,

127
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:40,749
plus 1 minus the specificity or 1 minus
0.88 times the prevalence in this test.

128
00:08:40,749 --> 00:08:41,310
Okay.
So

129
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,814
that's just the expanded version of what
this is.

130
00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:50,000
It's the probability of testing positive
in two different situations.

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,701
Okay.
Applying the sensitivity in 1

132
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:54,045
minus the specificity.

133
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:55,330
So doing all this out.

134
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,918
I'm running out of room here.

135
00:08:56,918 --> 00:08:59,826
If you do have this calculation, you're
going to get 59%.

136
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:05,370
So the PPV of the test in the specific
situation of having a prevalence of

137
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:11,310
resistance of 50% in the general
population is 59%.

138
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,440
Please note that this value for the PPV is
going to change.

139
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,440
If the prevalence in the general
population changes.

140
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,004
The next part of this question is

141
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:28,420
asking about the negative predictive
value.

142
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,900
The prevalence of resistance is still 50%
in the general population, but

143
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,970
now it's asking us to predict the negative
predictive value of the test.

144
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,110
And so again, we can't calculate this
directly.

145
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,228
We're going to use Bayes' rule for

146
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:45,100
this, and we're going to set that up in a
similar way.

147
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,836
So, the probability that the NPV is the
probability that you're a responder,

148
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:55,120
in this situation, given that the test
result is negative.

149
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,178
Okay?
So, if I set that up using Bayes' Rule

150
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:04,745
[SOUND] it's going to look like this.

151
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:09,323
[SOUND].

152
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:12,210
Okay.

153
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,086
And we can fill these in with the
information we calculated in

154
00:10:16,086 --> 00:10:19,520
the earlier parts of this question.

155
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,120
So this, of course, is just the
specificity.

156
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,540
So this is just going to be 0.88 the
probability that your responder's given in

157
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,160
the question stem, that's going to be 0.5.

158
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,800
The probability of having a negative test.

159
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,880
Again, we're going to use the expanded
definition here.

160
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,170
What we're going to do is multiply the
specificity times the problems rate in

161
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,155
the population.

162
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:46,769
And add that to 1 minus the sensitivity or
1 minus 0.12.

163
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:48,031
Excuse me.

164
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:51,358
I believe [SOUND] it was 0.17.

165
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:55,303
It's 1 minus 0.17,

166
00:10:55,303 --> 00:11:02,690
multiplied by 0.5, okay?

167
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,760
So this is going to give us the
probability of testing negative.

168
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:13,040
These represent both situations in which
the test would come out negative.

169
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,439
So if we multiply all this out, and again
I'm outta space, but

170
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:25,210
if you multiply all this out, the NPV
works itself out to be approximately 51%.

171
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:30,430
The fourth question is asking about
probabilities again.

172
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,627
So, in a blind taste test,

173
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:35,663
there're three panelist, that taste five
different pizza brands.

174
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay?
It's not important what brands they are.

175
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,860
Let's just say it's a brand A, B, C, D, E.

176
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:49,140
What's the probability that all three
panelists rate one of these last.

177
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,560
Let's say E.

178
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,315
So what's the probability that all
panelists rate E last purely by chance.

179
00:11:56,315 --> 00:12:02,579
Okay, the question says, assume there's no
taste difference between the five brands,

180
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:07,834
and this is, that this is purely due to
chance.

181
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:08,690
Okay.
Well,

182
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:15,230
what's the probability of selecting E
among these five purely due to chance?

183
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,900
It's just 1 5th.

184
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,454
And for this to happen for

185
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:24,480
all three judges, it would have to be 1
5th times 1 5th times 1 5th, right?

186
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,870
So, that's going to lead us to 0.008 or in
other words 0.8%.

187
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:37,202
So, there's very low likelihood that if
all of these pizzas were equal,

188
00:12:37,202 --> 00:12:43,080
that they would all rate one of them last
[SOUND].

189
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,340
So then, we move on to the last question
in the status sentence.

190
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,065
This is again another "at least" type
probability problem.

191
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:54,250
So let's keep that in mind as we think
about this.

192
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,764
So the question starts out by saying that
the in the early 1980s,

193
00:12:58,764 --> 00:13:05,490
patients received reconstituted clotting
factor derived from human blood.

194
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,067
Okay.
The concentrates were

195
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:09,955
pooled from about 1,000 donors per lot.

196
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:14,373
If the prevalence of HIV in this donor
blood was about 1 in

197
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:19,731
3,000 [SOUND] what was the probability
that a hemophiliac would

198
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:27,320
contract HIV from a single infusion of
clotting factors.

199
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,161
Okay?
So let me

200
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:31,460
write this out using word words first.

201
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:39,080
The probability of having at least one HIV
positive transfusion

202
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,414
in those sort of 1,000 donor lots is equal
to 1 minus

203
00:13:44,414 --> 00:13:54,244
the probability of having no HIV positive
donors.

204
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:55,176
Right?

205
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:58,540
And that makes sense.

206
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,284
So you have a lot of chances for having
HIV positive, but

207
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:06,172
these are all encapsulated by doing one
minus the probability of

208
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:11,300
having exactly zero HIV positive donors.

209
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,230
And so what is that probability?

210
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:19,014
So if the probability, if the prevalence
is one out of 3000,

211
00:14:19,014 --> 00:14:24,730
then what we can do is do 1 minus 1 out of
3000.

212
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,080
Okay, to get the probability.

213
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,466
of no HIV positive donors.

214
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:33,747
And, of course, these are pooled over
1,000 donor lots.

215
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,331
So I'm going to raise that to 1000, and
then,

216
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:43,138
I'm going to subtract all of that from one
here to mimic this part of the equation.

217
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:44,067
Okay?

218
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:46,263
To get at least the probability of at
least,

219
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:49,396
of having at least one HIV-positive donor.

220
00:14:49,396 --> 00:14:56,873
So it's 1 minus the quantity 1 minus 1
over 3000, raised to [INAUDIBLE] 1000.

221
00:14:56,873 --> 00:15:01,737
And that's going to equal 28.4%.

222
00:15:01,737 --> 00:15:04,712
And that ends Homework 3.
