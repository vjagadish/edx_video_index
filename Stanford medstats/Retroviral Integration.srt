1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:05,220
Good morning students, today we're going
to talk about Retroviral Integration.

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,740
So here we go.
I'm going to draw for

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,040
you, retroviral genome here.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,960
And this is the retroviral genome after

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,420
reverse transcript phase has converted the
retroviral RNA into double-stranded DNA.

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,100
And the retroviral genome

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,800
has a long terminal repeat of the same
sequence at both ends.

8
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,230
And for the purposes of this discussion.

9
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,765
This will be the HIV, you know?

10
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:51,930
[SOUND]
Because

11
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,100
of its medical importance and we will have
a little blow up of the HIV genome.

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:05,670
And I would just draw a few nucleotides
here for illustration.

13
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,890
That's the upper strand, and here's the
lower strand.

14
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:14,215
And these two nucleotides right

15
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:18,432
here are critical for

16
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:24,059
whats going to happen next.

17
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:31,412
Because it's going to turn out that the
retroviral

18
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:37,910
integrase [SOUND] will remove two
nucleotides

19
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:45,270
from the three prime ends, both three
prime ends.

20
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:53,667
So I'll remove two of the nucleotides from
this particular end,

21
00:01:53,667 --> 00:02:00,020
[COUGH] leaving us with a, recess three
prime hydroxyl.

22
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:06,830
Now I'm going to draw the target of the
retroviral integration event.

23
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,890
And that'll be the host genome, the retro
virus wants to jump into the host genome.

24
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,010
So we will draw the host genome for you.

25
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,490
Double stranded DNA there.

26
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,629
And I'm going to show you the retroviral
genome curled up.

27
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:38,500
And it's curled up because the retroviral
integrase will hold on to both LTRs.

28
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,360
So we've got the two unpaired nucleotides
at

29
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,195
the five prime end of the upper strand, in
the previous diagram.

30
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:54,120
[BLANK_AUDIO]

31
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,660
And the unit three prime hydroxyl here and
then, two unpaired

32
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,150
[BLANK_AUDIO]

33
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,870
Nucleotides with high prime and of the
other strand, the lower strand,

34
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,430
from the previous diagram, ending in a
three prime hydroxyl, there.

35
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,587
And, these three prime hydroxyls will be
used by

36
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:20,280
the integrase to catalyze nucleophilic
attacks, on the host DNA.

37
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,700
So, we will draw that.

38
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,910
And the nucleophilic attacks occur,

39
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,508
offset from each other, and the offset
here, I'm going to put in black brackets.

40
00:03:32,508 --> 00:03:38,125
And those that bracketed sequence between

41
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:43,741
the two sites of nucleophilic attack is
going

42
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:49,651
to be destined to become a short direct
repeat,

43
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:55,886
and you'll see that by the time we're
finished.

44
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:57,520
[BLANK_AUDIO]

45
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,106
So [COUGH]
Just to review the integrase.

46
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:13,850
[NOISE]

47
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:19,594
Catalyzes

48
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:27,250
nucleophilic

49
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,900
attacks, on the host DNA.

50
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,680
Both strands of the host DNA.

51
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,953
[BLANK_AUDIO]
[COUGH] And I'm going to show you

52
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:44,580
the results of that, those nucleophilic
attacks.

53
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,280
So, starting, and this time I'm going to
start with the lower.

54
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,910
I'll draw the diagram from the lower
strand, three prime end of the host DNA,

55
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,690
moving over to that side.

56
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:14,391
And then, that nucleophilic will attack
actually

57
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:21,716
creates a covalent bond with a retro viral
DNA.

58
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:23,772
[BLANK_AUDIO]

59
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:32,371
Five prime in [COUGH].

60
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,420
Now, if I do, draw in.

61
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,085
Let me finish drawing the bottom strand
here.

62
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:43,940
[BLANK_AUDIO]

63
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,780
Here's the end of the bottom strand five
prime.

64
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,771
Now, starting from the three

65
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:59,752
prime end of the upper strand,

66
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:08,266
we'll show you results of the nucleophilic

67
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:14,580
attack at the upper strand.

68
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,420
And the lower strand, the upper strand, I
am sorry.

69
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,460
Let's draw it in blue.

70
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,140
It's all the way up to there.

71
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,340
There we go.
[COUGH] So,

72
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,100
this configuration is a little hard to
see.

73
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,930
So what we need to do is to pull the DNA
ends out so you can see everything.

74
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,270
I'm not going to, I'm not going to change
anything.

75
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,750
All the bonds are still there.

76
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,150
It's just the geometry will change for
ease of viewing.

77
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,830
So again if I start with the three prime
end of the lower strand.

78
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,640
Of course, we want to keep our color
coding.

79
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,766
So we're, if we're talking about the three
prime end

80
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:11,782
of the lower strand, we want that host DNA
to be blue,

81
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:16,810
it's going to be covalent linked to
retroviral DNA.

82
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,130
[BLANK_AUDIO]

83
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,547
There's the retroviral DNA, and

84
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:29,962
it's protruding five prime and,

85
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:35,760
[COUGH] the same thing goes, and then
well-

86
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,560
[BLANK_AUDIO]

87
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,117
The continuation.

88
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:47,180
[BLANK_AUDIO]

89
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,390
The continuation of the host DNA over
here.

90
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,380
I'm leaving a gap there on purpose.

91
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:02,015
You're going to see why I have to do that,
[COUGH] because, if I draw,

92
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:06,444
start drawing the five prime end of the
retroviral,

93
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:10,790
upper DNA strand, that only goes up to
this point.

94
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:19,180
Let me, draw a little more carefully, only
goes up to that point.

95
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,400
Because, it doesn't reach all

96
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,410
the way over because there's a gap, that's
exactly the distance,

97
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,500
that between the two nucleophilic attacks
on the upper part of the diagram.

98
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,668
And if I continue drawing the retroviral
DNA

99
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:44,144
[BLANK_AUDIO]

100
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:46,800
I come up to here.

101
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,955
Let me curl this thing down to make it a
little easier for you to see.

102
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:56,136
[BLANK_AUDIO]

103
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,007
Okay.

104
00:08:58,007 --> 00:09:07,130
And then we have the point of covalent
attachment there.

105
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,910
[BLANK_AUDIO]

106
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,410
Voila.

107
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,016
We've got another gap over here.

108
00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:17,608
[COUGH]
So

109
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:22,850
that is the previous diagram, stretched
out.

110
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,650
Nothing has changed.

111
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:33,130
What happens next is, that nuclease comes
along and removes

112
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:40,120
the protruding two nucleotides at the five
prime ends, the unpaired two nucleotides.

113
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,920
And then post polymerase.

114
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,540
We'll draw that in blue,

115
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:54,080
host polymerase, DNA polymerase and
ligase.

116
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,300
[BLANK_AUDIO]

117
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,260
Repair the gaps.

118
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:07,930
[BLANK_AUDIO]

119
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,450
Okay, now, I'll draw that.

120
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:16,837
Here's the polymerase coming along, and
then the ligase finishing the job.

121
00:10:16,837 --> 00:10:20,652
Polymerase coming along, ligase, finishing
the job.

122
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:27,200
And, voila, you've got the retroviral DNA
integrated into the host genome.

123
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,800
And the epilogue is, of course,

124
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,310
understanding retroviral integration has
led to the development of HIV inhibitors,

125
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,580
which are now being used to treat patients
with HIV infection.

126
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,550
Thank you so much.

127
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:53,550
[BLANK_AUDIO]
