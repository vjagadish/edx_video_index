1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,870
In this next module, I'm going to tell you
about multinomial logistic regression

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,750
which is used when you have a categorical
outcome that has more than 2 levels.

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:19,660
So, so far we've been talking about binary
outcome But what

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,110
if your outcome variable is a categorical
variable with more than two levels?

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,630
What do you do then?

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,830
So, one of the things that you'll see that
people sometimes do in the literature is

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,470
they'll actually just collapse that
multilevel categorical variable into

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,190
only two categories.

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,410
Unfortunately, that's not ideal,

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,650
because you're losing a lot of information
when you do that.

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,640
Now, that would make sense if, say one of
the categories had only very few

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,210
people in it and there wasn't a big enough
sample size in one of

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,900
the categories you may then have to
collapse it.

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,660
But assuming you have a reasonable sample
size in each of the categories it's not

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,710
ideal to collect them and to lose that
information.

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,070
Another thing that you could do, which is
conceptually pretty

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,970
easy is just to think about the outcome
variable and dummy coat it.

18
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,510
So, I told you how to dummy coat.

19
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,470
Predicting the variables,

20
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,490
dummy coating the outcome variable would
work in exactly the same way.

21
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,920
Dummy coat the outcome variable and you
simply run a Series of binary regressions.

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,580
Each of those regressions will compare one
of the categories to

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,140
the reference category.

24
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,420
And you could do that, conceptually
there's nothing new,

25
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,850
it's very easy to understand.

26
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,940
I'm actually going to walk you through An
example of doing this,

27
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,390
because I think conceptually it will be
very easy to get your head around.

28
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,330
And this is actually not all that
different than doing multinomial with

29
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,160
logistic regression.

30
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,160
Of course the optimal thing to do, is to
do the multinomial logistic regression.

31
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,340
This is the preferred...

32
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,010
Thing to do.

33
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,270
Assuming that your statistical package
will run it for

34
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,280
you is a lot easier to implement than you
running a series of multiple regressions.

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,060
So this is the preferred technique but I
just want you to understand that it's

36
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,290
not very different from just fitting a
series of binary regressions.

37
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,720
You're going to get almost the same
answer.

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,320
They're going to be slightly different for
reasons I'll talk about.

39
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,090
But conceptually, it's very similar to
just running a series of

40
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,510
binary regressions.

41
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,300
And since you already know everything that
you need to know to run a series of

42
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,800
binary regressions, I'm going to start my
example there because I think it's

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,530
easy to follow and to get your head
around.

44
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,700
So, the example data that I'm going to be
using in this module,

45
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,370
is some more data on runners I.

46
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,650
Do a lot of studies on runners.

47
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,850
This is an older data set,

48
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,240
some cross-sectional data, on 150 college
aged distance runners.

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,500
And we were looking at the outcome of
menstrual irregularities.

50
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,410
So it turns out that a lot of distance
runners, have irregular periods.

51
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,060
This is not great because it's,

52
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,160
that's tied to having lower bone density
and being at risk for fractures.

53
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,160
But the outcome, menstrual irregularity,

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,370
is actually a three level categorical
variable.

55
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,410
So clinically, we say that women are
Eumenorrheic, if they have normal periods.

56
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,990
In this data set 2 3rds of them, 100 out
of 150, Were Eumenorrheic.

57
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,640
Then women may also have irregular
periods.

58
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,070
So we call that Oligomenorrheic, and the
periods are just irregular, but

59
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,510
not completely absent.

60
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,020
And we have 37 women with Oligomenorrhea
in this data set.

61
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,350
And then finally, sort of the most severe
mestrular, menstrual irregularity that

62
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,230
women can have is to have absolutely no
periods, or very, very few.

63
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,720
And that's called Amenorrhea and we had 13
women in that category.

64
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,310
So, that's the outcome variable.

65
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,270
It's three levels.

66
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,610
Now, you could say, okay, well, I have
sort of two bad comes here,

67
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,220
Oligomenorrhea and Amenorrhea and maybe, I
could just collapse them and

68
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,040
look at that group as whole but again, why
use that information?

69
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,970
Because they, Oligomenorrea group and

70
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,739
Amenorrhea group are actually different
and we can analyze them separately.

71
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,650
The predictor that I'm going to use for
this particular example is one of

72
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,750
the things that we know causes menstrual
irregularity is disordered or

73
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,370
restrictive eating, not taking in enough
calories for the amount you're expending.

74
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,620
And so we had a measurement of uh- eating
disorder a score on a,

75
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,430
a particular questionnaire, so the this
variable I'm abbreviating as the EDIA.

76
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,820
It's basically a score that ranges from 0
to 21, 21 would mean that you had lot of

77
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,200
extreme behaviors in terms of eating and
restricting your caloric intake.

78
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,390
So let's say I didn't know anything about
multinomial logistic regression, but

79
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,970
I knew about regular old logistic
regression.

80
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,630
Here's one thing that I could do to handle
these data.

81
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,630
I could say, okay well,

82
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,340
I want to compare the amenorrheic women to
the eumenorrheic women, and

83
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,750
I want to compare the oligomenorrheic
women to the eumenorrheic women.

84
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,550
So, I could literally run two logistic
regression models.

85
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,920
So in my first model, I would have a
sample size for this model of 113.

86
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,010
I would compare the eumenorrheic women,
the normal or

87
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,950
reference group, to the 13 women who were
amenorrheic.

88
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,700
I would exclude the women who are
oligomennorheic.

89
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,180
So, I would exclude that other category
entirely.

90
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:04,270
My predictor here is this EDIA score and I
would put that into the model.

91
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,750
What I am going to get out from the model,
therefore, is an odds ratio that tells me,

92
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,670
if I increase By one unit in my eating
disorder score,

93
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,780
what is the increase in my odds of getting
amenorrhea?

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,580
I could run that.

95
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,310
I'm going to get an alpha and a beta, or
an odds ratio from that model.

96
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,700
And then I could do the same thing but
looking at the outcome of oligomenorrhea

97
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,080
rather than the outcome of amenorrhea, so
I would exclude the amenorrheic women from

98
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,370
the next analysis This model will have 137
women in it.

99
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,100
I will compare just the oligomenorrheaic
women to the reference group,

100
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,210
again with the predictor of eating
disorder score.

101
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,980
And I will get out some kind of odds
ratio.

102
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,020
This odds ratio will tell me what's my
increase in my odds of

103
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,750
getting oligomenorrhea for every one unit
increase in this eating disorder scale.

104
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,620
These logistic regressions will work in
all the same ways that we've

105
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,500
already talked about.

106
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,480
So let me start with this first model
here.

107
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,570
Modelling the odds of amenorrhea.

108
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,110
So, if I'm going to run a regular logistic
regression,

109
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,520
first thing I should do is take my
continuous variable,

110
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,600
my EDI score and plot it against the logit
of the outcome.

111
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,960
And the outcome here is amenorrhea.

112
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,450
So again we are completely Excluding the
oligomenorrheaic women from this analysis.

113
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,870
When I do the logit plot, you can see that
it is pretty linear in the logit and

114
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,260
of course, we want to check that.

115
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,210
It's reasonably fits a straight line here.

116
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,070
So then I'm just going to run my logistic
regression model,

117
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,930
which I went ahead and did.

118
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,240
Here is the results.

119
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,240
So my alpha, my intercept, is negative
3.1, my slope is 0.1609,

120
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,090
that's my beta coefficient for this eating
disorder score.

121
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,660
For.

122
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,800
You can see that the p value for EDIA is
highly significant.

123
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,480
And the beta coefficient is positive so as
you go up in your EDIA score, you indeed,

124
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,490
do have an increase in your odds of being
amenorrhea.

125
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,500
And, notice that the,

126
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,659
the model that we're getting out here,
this is the logit of amenorrhea.

127
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:13,870
Is equal to negative 3.15 plus 0.1609,
times the EDIA score, that's our model.

128
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,270
If you look back at the Logit plot from
the last slide,

129
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,585
this model directly corresponds to that
Logit plot.

130
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:24,300
So,the intercept in my model comes out to
be negative 3.15 well, you can see if I

131
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,730
fit a straight line, that's indeed exactly
where I would Hit the Y axis here.

132
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,140
And also you could figure out that the
slope does indeed look like about .16.

133
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,730
And it's highly significant.

134
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,110
We can also talk not just about the beta
coefficients but

135
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,740
we can translate that beta-coefficient
into and odds ratio.

136
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,440
So ,I went ahead and did that as well.

137
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,890
So if I look at the odds ration for

138
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,740
a 1 point change in this eating disorder
scale score.

139
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,350
Which again goes from 0 to 21.

140
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,840
So the 1 point change isn't huge.

141
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,260
A 1 point change.

142
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,490
Corresponds to an odds ratio of 1.175.

143
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,810
So, that would that you, your odds of
being amenorrheic

144
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:07,030
goes up by about 18% for every 1 point
increase in your eating disorder score.

145
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,660
Now, that's a small unit.

146
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:14,810
We could also maybe look at this Standard
deviation of EDIA score as your predictor.

147
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,690
So this standard deviation of EDIA score
of this group was about six and so

148
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,650
if we looked at a one standard deviation
increase,

149
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,920
if your EDIA score goes up a whole
standard deviation, then the increase

150
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,530
in your odds of being amenorrheic is 160%,
the odds ratio is 2.6 or 2.7.

151
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:38,380
So, you can see of course it looks more
impressive if we use a bigger unit for

152
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,050
EDI score.

153
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,190
So, that's the logistic model for

154
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,070
amenorrhea, I will also show you the ROC
curve for amenorrhea.

155
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,418
First of all, the area under the curve
here was about 75%, so

156
00:08:49,418 --> 00:08:54,610
we actually have pretty good predictive
ability with just this one question here.

157
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,010
The, these are pretty tightly linked
dimensional function and

158
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,570
restrictive eating.

159
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,120
I want to point out something that's kind
inside here about the ROC curve that

160
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,980
something we haven't talked about yet in
this class.So,

161
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,460
just wanted to note to you that notice
that this ROC curve kind of has a,

162
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,800
a plateau in it and it, we called it an
infliction point.

163
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,750
Sometimes, when people are building
clinical prediction models.

164
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,500
They don't want to talk about the
continuous variables.

165
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,350
So in this case, our predictor is this EDI
score.

166
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,180
And they don't want to like have to plug
that continuous predictor into

167
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,880
a logistic regression model in order to
get out a predicted probability.

168
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,070
They want something that has a little more
clinical utility that could be, sort of,

169
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,170
applied quickly, you know, in the
emergency room.

170
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,670
So, we're not going to be plugging into a
logistic regression model.

171
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,190
In the emergency room for example.

172
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,820
So, there's like kind of one cutoff.

173
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,780
And how can you, what's a way that you
could choose that cutoff?

174
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,810
So sometimes people will use the ROC curve
to choose, a clinical cutoff.

175
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,400
Now of course, whatever cutoff you choose,
based on one set of data.

176
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,360
That's going to be very fit to that
particular data set, you are.

177
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,220
You course you're going to need to

178
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,090
validate that cut off in other
populations.

179
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:08,080
But just to show you kind of how you would
decide that, notice that this ROC curve

180
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,480
you could go up, as you go up in
sensitivity steeply,

181
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,410
initially, there is not much corresponding
drop-off in specificity.

182
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,090
So, if you climb up to this point in the
curve,

183
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,950
you get this great increase in sensitivity
pretty quickly without any little with

184
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,350
very little cost to specificity.

185
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,960
However after this point and this point by
the way corresponds to

186
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,280
a predictive probability of I think this,
.14% in that...

187
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,760
Corresponds to an EDI score of 9.

188
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,370
So, that dot right here was, if you made
your cut off for a test positive

189
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,880
an EDI score of 9 or greater, that would
give you this little dot on the graph.

190
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,670
But notice then,

191
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,785
if you were then to make the cutoff
higher, say to choose a score of.

192
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:59,570
10 or 11 or 12 to kind of be your cut off
you all of a sudden don't gain

193
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:04,110
much sensitivity at all but you have this
huge drop in specificity.

194
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,560
So, if I was to try to kind of make a
clinical cut off based on this

195
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,660
ROC curve this one kind of has a nature
point that you can see you might want to

196
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,180
put the cut off right there.

197
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,720
So, if I look at this cut-off, of, say if,
if you have a score of greater than or

198
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,310
equal to 9 on this questionnaire where you
are going to be a scream positive for

199
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,310
being likely to have the outcome of
menstrual irregularity here.

200
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:30,070
That gives a sensitivity of 69% and a
specificity of 85% for

201
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,340
detecting amenorrhea and that's probably
about the best we can do.

202
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,570
If I put the cut-off anywhere else, there
is going to be a such a,

203
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,480
huge drop in specificity.

204
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,360
That is probably not going to be optimal.

205
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,650
So you can use an ROC curve in this way,

206
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,230
this is something we haven't talked about
yet, to try to find a clinical cutoff.

207
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,170
But again, be very careful in doing this,

208
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,990
because of course, we've overfit for sure
to this particular sample,

209
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,830
you know the cutoff of nine is very
specific to this particular sample.

210
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,290
We'd want to validate that that's going to
hold up in other different samples and

211
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,760
bigger populations.

212
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,450
But I just wanted to mention that because
we haven't talked about that use of ROC

213
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,050
curves Curves you.

214
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,620
Okay, now kind of coming back to the
discussion on the multinomial regression.

215
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,120
So we ran the logistic regression with
amenorrhea versus umenorrhea

216
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,210
as the outcome.

217
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,500
I can run a similar logistic regression
but

218
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,170
now focus on the outcome of oligomenorrhea
and exclude the women with amenorrhea.

219
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,210
And that's what I've done here.

220
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,270
I'm showing you the logistic, the logit
plot, so

221
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:32,780
the logit of oligomenorrhea is the outcome
now, my predictor is still this EDI score.

222
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,440
This graph represents 137 people we've.

223
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,700
Excluded the women with amenorrhea.

224
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,210
This looks again, nice and linear in the
logit.

225
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,880
So we have a nice linear relationship
between the score and

226
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,000
the logit of amenorrhea.

227
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,680
the, you can see that the intercept's
going to come out somewhere around

228
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,470
negative 1.5 or a little bit lower than
that.

229
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,020
In the slope it's going to be positive.

230
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,290
And, indeed, when I run this data in a
logistic regression model,

231
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,720
here is my outcome.

232
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,310
I indeed get a slope, or a little bit less
than negative 1.5.

233
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,130
My beta coefficient this time is 0.10,

234
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,560
so it's smaller than the beta coefficient
was when the outcome was amenorrhoea.

235
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,150
But it is still highly Statistically
significant.

236
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:15,555
We can also calculate the odds ratios.

237
00:13:15,555 --> 00:13:20,685
So,the odds ratio for a one unit increase
in this score I get about a 10 or

238
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:23,660
11% increase in my odds of oligomennorhea.

239
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,760
If I look at a standard deviation increase
in this score,

240
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,820
my odds ratio is 1.85 or 1.86.

241
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:33,100
So, I get about an 86% increase in my odds
of oligomennorhea.

242
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,030
So that you can see that the relationship
between this EDIA score and

243
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,820
oligomenorrhea is not as strong as it was
for the more extreme outcome of

244
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,970
amenorrhea, but I can report these
separate, these odds ratios separately.

245
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:53,110
Just to show you, show you the ROC curve
With EDI predicting oligomenorrhea,

246
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,450
the area end of the curve is a lot less
steep so

247
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,370
this, this score is not as predictive of
oligomenorrhea as it was for

248
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,730
amenorrehea also it doesn't, the ROC
doesn't have you kind of

249
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,670
a similar nice cut off point as it did for
the amenorrehea outcome.

250
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,500
But that's all that you would do if wanted
to run a series of

251
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,480
binary logistic progression here.

252
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,590
Then, what you would report in your paper
with the odds ratio for amenorrhea, for

253
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,620
every you know,

254
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,630
increase in EDAI score and then you would
report the odds ratio for amenorrhea.

255
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,970
You would get, you would report those odds
ratios separately.

256
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,130
In fact, doing the multinomial regression
is really not very different than that.

257
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,250
So, I, now, I took all these data and

258
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:39,790
I put them into one Multinomial regression
in my computer and here are the results.

259
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:44,180
So, what you'll get in your output is
you'll have two intercepts and

260
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,240
you'll have two betas.

261
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,700
You'll have an intercept for the outcome
of amenorrhea and an intercept for

262
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,910
the outcome of oligomenorrhea.

263
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,650
And similarly you're going to have two
betas.

264
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,330
A beta for amenorrhea and a beta for
oligomentherea.

265
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,410
If you go through this output and look at
the beta coefficients and

266
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,070
their standard errors and the p-values
What you're going to notice,

267
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:09,280
is they're almost identical, to the ones
that I got when I just ran a series,

268
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,620
of separate binary logistic regressions.

269
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,330
So, it's really not very different.

270
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,200
They're going to be slightly different,
for

271
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,860
reasons I'll tell you but they're, almost
identical.

272
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,720
So for example the intercept for

273
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,008
amenorrhea, from the multinomial model,
when you ran everything together.

274
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:29,660
Is negative 3.19 when we

275
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,430
ran amenorrhea separately that intercept
came out to negative 3.15.

276
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,730
So it was in the second decimal place it
was slightly different.

277
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:44,010
The beta coefficient here for amenorrhea
is 0.1656.

278
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,250
When we ran it separately for amenorrhea,
the beta coefficient was 0.1609.

279
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,200
So again, a change in this time in the
third decimal place.

280
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,430
So, we're, it's a very small difference.

281
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,400
Similarly the standard errors the standard
error before for the beta coefficient for

282
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,900
amenorrhea was 0.0436.

283
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,200
It's exactly the same here.

284
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,940
That we probably have to go out a few
decimal places to see any difference.

285
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,680
And if you look, if you compare.

286
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,060
With the, the previous models I show you
for oligomenorrhea, you'll see same thing,

287
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,420
the beta coefficients that intercepts the
standard error,

288
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,550
the P values are almost all, almost this
exactly the same often you know,

289
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,570
a little bit different in a few decimal
places.

290
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,258
Similarly, if we translate these data
coefficients into odds ratios,

291
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:29,140
the odds ratios look similar to what we
saw before as well.

292
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,438
So, the odds ratio for amanorrhea is 1.18.

293
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:35,726
The odds ratio for oligomenorrhea is
1.106.

294
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:41,030
So, 18% increase in my odds of amenorrhea
as I go up in my EDI score.

295
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:45,640
But only a 10% increase or 11% increase in
my odds of oligomenorrhea.

296
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,490
But everything else is kind of looks very
similar.

297
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,610
You would report these separate odds
ratios in your paper.

298
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,280
So that's it really, that's all that
multinomial logistic regression is doing.

299
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,900
You're going to get separate odds ratios
for

300
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,900
the different outcomes compared with the
reference category.
