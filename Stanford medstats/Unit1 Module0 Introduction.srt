00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,190
Hello and welcome to HRB 223, Introduction
to Data Management and Analysis for SAS.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,890
My name is Joshua Wallack.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:07,458
>> And I'm Ron Somderash.

4
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:11,510
We're going to teach you the basics of how
to use SAS Enterprise Guide,

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,040
with weekly modules, quizzes and

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,490
homework assignment, we're going to
explore SAS Enterprise Guide together.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,770
>> SAS is a really important data analysis
tool for medical researchers and

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,676
clinical epidemiology.

9
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:22,210
Just.
With SAS Enterprise guide,

10
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,970
you can use code or point and click to
analyze your complex data sets.

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,890
Unlike code, where you actually have to
type out your commands, the point and

12
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,260
click interface works simply by pointing
and clicking your mouse.

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:33,900
>> Although the point and

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,900
click method is a great way to analyze
your data without having to write your

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,540
own code, it does have a lot of
limitations.

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,900
With that in mind, we're going to focus on
teaching you how to read, write, and

17
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,550
use your own code.

18
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,680
>> Since this course will focus on coding,

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,368
our lectures will generally be based in
SAS Enterprise Guide.

20
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:53,160
During the in-class meetings, there will
be lab sessions.

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,070
These are a great place for

22
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,040
you to ask about the homework assignments
or quiz questions.

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,900
We'll also be able to help you out with
any technical issues that may arise.

24
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,580
Enjoy the modules and we'll see you in
class.
