2
00:00:06,512 --> 00:00:07,364
So last week,

3
00:00:07,364 --> 00:00:12,620
I told you how to graph continuous
outcomes when you have repeated-measures.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,120
This week we're going to start our
discussion of statistical tests,

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,655
that are actually used to generate effect
sizes, and

6
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:20,780
p-values to go along with those graphics.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,250
So this week I'm going to give you an
overview of

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,225
the statistical tests that are available
for analyzing.

9
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:32,040
Repeated-measures data, with a focus on
continuous outcomes.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,880
I'm also going to tell you about some
tests that actually don't really

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,310
handle the repeated-measures very well,
that essentially simplify or

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,900
ignore the repeated-measures.

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,320
These are sort of old fashioned test.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,250
There's nothing necessarily wrong with
these tests, and

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,930
you may have a simple situation, when a
simple test will do.

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,100
It's also handy just to have these in your
toolbox, because sometimes you

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,750
do a more fancier, complicated model and
you're not quite sure that you're

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,700
getting the right answer, you can check,
with one of these simple tests and

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,780
make sure that you're getting, kind of a
similar answer no matter how you.

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,700
Analyze the data, so we'll go over some,
some options there.

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,830
I'm also going to show you how to do
repeated-measures ANOVA this week.

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,900
So, again I showed you last week, how to
graph repeated-measures outcome data.

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,570
We had an example of spine bone density
changing over the time.

24
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,810
I'm showing you these graphics again here.

25
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,300
I was comparing just three small groups of
women, and

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,170
you can see that sort of two of the groups
were increasing.

27
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,100
And the, the group in blue here was pretty
much staying flat on bone density.

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,200
The graph has a huge amount of
information,

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,040
you can pick up a lot just by looking at
the graphic.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,960
However, we usually want to.

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,880
Attach something to the graphic like an
effect size in the p-value.

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,080
So, this week, we're going to start
talking about statistical tests,

33
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,420
that can be used for analyzing
repeated-measures data.

34
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,429
