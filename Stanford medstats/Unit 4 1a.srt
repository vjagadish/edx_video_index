1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,420
In this next module we're going to spend a
little bit more time talking about some of

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,990
the tools that you would use as part of
doing a root cause analysis.

3
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,882
We're going to focus on three of them in
particular that

4
00:00:19,882 --> 00:00:25,760
I've personally found very helpful when
conducting root cause analysis.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,650
The first one, we've spent some time with,
is talking about brainstorming.

6
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,350
The second one is flow charting or process
mapping.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,720
And the third one is the use of the cause
and

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,910
effect diagram otherwise known as a
fishbone diagram.

9
00:00:43,174 --> 00:00:46,657
As the slide shows there are different
other,

10
00:00:46,657 --> 00:00:52,003
tools that you could certainly use as part
of a root cause analysis to figure out

11
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:57,106
exactly what's going on, in many of those
other situations it's a,

12
00:00:57,106 --> 00:01:01,642
a factor of taking advantage of data to
analyze what's going on and

13
00:01:01,642 --> 00:01:06,040
determine what may be root causes or a
contributing factor.

14
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,430
First one we're going to spend a little
bit of

15
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,309
time talking about is brain storming.

16
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,450
Some people know it as White Boarding.

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,620
Other call it Blue Sky.

18
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,910
See What Sticks.

19
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,960
Post It.

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,590
It's known by a variety of different
names.

21
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,165
But basically, the bottom line, is to
quickly generate as many ideas as

22
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:33,752
you can on a particular problem or a
particular subject.

23
00:01:33,752 --> 00:01:37,913
The whole concept is to try to take
advantage of everybody that's in

24
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:43,850
the room to throw out as many different
ideas in a very short period of time.

25
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,300
basically, the more ideas you throw up,

26
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,710
the more likelihood that you may, be able
to capture, maybe, some,

27
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:56,190
some different ideas about what's going on
with that particular situation.

28
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,570
Part of brainstorming is really
identifying either a topic,

29
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,620
a problem, issue, and making sure that
there is some degree of

30
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,870
mutual understanding of the task and
objective.

31
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:11,953
So, for starters, when you're doing this,
you'll have folks participating in and

32
00:02:11,953 --> 00:02:16,377
throwing out the ideas, and no idea is too
little, or too big, but

33
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:21,354
once you get through that process of
actually getting them up on the board,

34
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:26,420
then the next step is actually sorting
through them or prioritizing.

35
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,622
So that you can kind of focus in on what
may be the core issues that's going on.

36
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:36,165
The whole focus of this is really looking
at the number of ideas and

37
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:38,190
not necessarily the quality.

38
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,985
So I know it's really easy to throw those
ideas up, and to critique 'em, and

39
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:45,780
you know, criticize them saying that
they're not really practical, or that's

40
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,740
not what really happened, but in fact, the
real, the real intent is really to kind of

41
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,630
consider all of the variables that might
be involved in a particular situation.

42
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,480
One of the basic ground rules about
brainstorming is making sure that no

43
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,830
criticism is allowed.

44
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,620
and, you know, you, that can go both ways,
mostly negative, of course.

45
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,240
But, the other side of it is that no idea
thrown on the board should be ruled in as

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,050
the idea after you have been doing it for
a few minutes.

47
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,022
Most of the time you may take aside 10,

48
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:17,806
15 minutes worth of time to be able to
come up with some of

49
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:21,890
the different ideas that might have
contributed to a particular situation.

50
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,700
Process map, otherwise known as flow
charting.

51
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,930
Pictures are worth a thousand words.

52
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:37,370
So, a map that draws out a picture really
does permit a reader or reviewers to

53
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:43,150
actually visualize what the different
steps are or the different processes

54
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:49,391
are that's involved in anything that's
going on when it comes to patient care.

55
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:55,033
This picture really does permit the reader
to see the different inputs and

56
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:59,674
outputs, ramification of action as well as
linkages,

57
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:05,134
that may occur between other processes,
that either run in parallel or

58
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:09,220
are contributing to what you're
evaluating.

59
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,162
Or even looking at what might be happening
downstream.

60
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:17,854
So really, you know, the whole concept
behind process mapping is to kind of, kind

61
00:04:17,854 --> 00:04:22,342
of, pictorially show, diagrammatically to
folks who are involved with

62
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:28,800
doing the root cause analysis, more of an
understanding of the step-by-step-by-step.

63
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,660
Now, along the same line,

64
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,090
some people may confuse this with actually
developing a timeline.

65
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:41,590
A timeline is more of the chronological
review of the sequence of events,

66
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,520
or sequencing of steps that might occur.

67
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,598
And it is actually something that you can
use in conjunction with

68
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:50,452
doing your process mapping to understand
what's going on.

69
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:54,940
One of the variables that often times is
missed when doing a root cause analysis

70
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,972
is, you know, people may understand the
step-by-step, but the timing of when those

71
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:05,208
steps occur can actually contribute to why
the event happened, or actually paint

72
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:09,761
a different picture of the dynamics that
was going on at the time of an event.

73
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:14,948
This next slide actually shows a very
simple flow chart it has to

74
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:19,498
do with something that many of us do every
morning, and

75
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:22,200
that's the issue of waking up.

76
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,310
So, you have a start, and the alarm rings.

77
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,650
Are you ready to get up?

78
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,120
Yes or no?

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,216
The diamonds are generally used as a
decision step in

80
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:36,290
terms of making a yes or no decision.

81
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,462
If you say no, you hit the snooze button
and go back to sleep and

82
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:43,350
then the alarm clock re-triggers again in
five minutes.

83
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,390
If you're ready to get up, you take that
next step in the process.

84
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:52,140
Roll out of bed, climb out of bed, crawl
out of bed, and then on with your day.

85
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,674
So this is a very simple process map.

86
00:05:55,674 --> 00:06:00,939
You may be surprised or not surprised to
find that some of the steps involved in

87
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:06,366
evaluating things like root cause in the
course of doing a root cause analysis,

88
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:12,500
such as a medication error or a surgical
procedure event, or a communication gap.

89
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,428
You may find yourself drilling down and
finding that there may be tens if

90
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:23,450
not hundreds of little steps involved with
carrying out that particular function.

91
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,027
I know one couple studies of been
published about

92
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:31,590
evaluating the nursing process for
administrative medication.

93
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,558
From the point of them getting the order,
to pulling the medication out,

94
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:39,270
to preparing the medication, and
administering the medication had

95
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,130
something in the neighborhood of like 80
plus some odd steps.

96
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,138
So, you know, you, you wouldn't be
surprised that if

97
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:50,106
there are that many steps with all these
different decisions involved and

98
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:55,262
any time that there may be a disruption or
interruption of any one of those steps.

99
00:06:55,262 --> 00:07:00,153
You probably are not going to be surprised
to find that a medication error or

100
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,020
medication event can occur.

101
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,788
The next tool we're going to talk about is
cause and

102
00:07:06,788 --> 00:07:11,600
effect diagram, otherwise known as
Fishbone diagram, or Ishikawa diagram.

103
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,135
Once again visuals are very, very helpful
for

104
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:17,950
the participants to understand why a
particular event was to occur?

105
00:07:18,978 --> 00:07:21,256
When you're using a fishbone diagram,

106
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:25,075
you use elements of your brain storing
process to kind of throw,

107
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:30,220
what are some of the factors that might
have contributed to leading the event.

108
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,170
Now when you're doing the brain storming
it's hard to take, just a brain storm idea

109
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:39,526
and show that there is a connection with
other aspects of a particular system or

110
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,562
process and that's where you use a
Fishbone diagram to

111
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,654
actually demonstrate the linkage between
those different ideas and

112
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:49,240
how it can contribute to the adverse
outcome.

113
00:07:50,322 --> 00:07:54,921
This Fishbone diagram does connect the
individual cause-and-effect relationship

114
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:59,198
to reveal any of the system type causes
within a particular issue.

115
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:01,520
On its own you may not be able to see it.

116
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,710
But certainly when you see it in the
context of how it's related to

117
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,183
other things that are going on for the
[INAUDIBLE].

118
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:11,011
You can actually paint a very definitive
picture of system process issues that

119
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:13,078
needs to be addressed.

120
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:17,110
These Fishbone diagrams can be very, very
basic.

121
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:23,050
Just to let you know, you know, when
you're doing these things in a group you,

122
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,450
you'll be surprised how much you can
accomplish in, in 15, 20 minutes.

123
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,170
or, you know, you can take hours and

124
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,010
actually, you know, go down to extreme
details.

125
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,200
Depending on what the issues are, you
could really use the tool to drill down.

126
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,760
To figure out what is going on?

127
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,450
What are the cause and effect of any
particular, system process issue?

128
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,150
And then when you add variables into that,

129
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,520
you can really show how the linkages can
occur between these things.

130
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,547
Thereby helping you identify what you need
to do in terms of solutions.

131
00:08:55,547 --> 00:09:01,440
Now, part of the Fishbone diagram is going
to include the head of the fish,

132
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,800
basically the problem, effect, or outcome.

133
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,750
In this case we're doing a root cause
analysis so

134
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,020
we actually had a adverse outcome or a
significant near miss.

135
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,140
There's your problem.

136
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,180
The horizontal branches on the Fishbone,
actually outlines your causes,

137
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,140
so, in this case were talking about
variety of different things that

138
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,340
actually led to that particular outcome,
each one of those diagonal lines,

139
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:36,190
are, could be considered major processes
or major systems.

140
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,480
And with them, then they identified the
different causes.

141
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,850
The sub-branches are really the reasons
why a particular cause was to occur.

142
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,874
So there's your reasons, you know, take
for

143
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:54,632
example staff there was an adverse
outcome.

144
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:58,209
It actually led to an unintended retain
foreign object and

145
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:03,150
because the staff wasn't trained on a
particular new piece of equipment.

146
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,700
They didn't know that the setup had
particular little parts that needed to

147
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,220
be done, that needed to be secured.

148
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,158
And as a result,

149
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:16,650
because they weren't secured properly, it
was left in the patient.

150
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:21,550
Really the reason for something like that
could be attributed to staff education.

151
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,780
It could be related to the lighting,

152
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,810
it could be related to the instructions
that came from the manufacturer.

153
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,401
It could be, you know, those were the
reasons that we're drilling down to

154
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:33,730
identify what the real root cause are.

155
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,480
So we can put the system process fix in,
into place.

156
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,150
Some other categories, and

157
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,980
these are the categories that we kind of
focus in on from a greater system process.

158
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,280
You may, you want to consider using the
methodology of machine,

159
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,750
material, measurement, management, method,
and manpower.

160
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,630
Each one of those major categories.

161
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,260
You know, if you use the direct missions
methodology,

162
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,300
we'll make reference to things like human
resources,

163
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,000
leadership medication management,
performance improvement.

164
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,575
You know, the, the, the categories kind of
drive really who's going to be

165
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:14,880
responsible or dealing with ownership some
time in some organization.

166
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,394
So, just be aware that you can use
different categories, as,

167
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:24,140
as part of the causes in evaluating when
you're doing a Fishbone diagram.

168
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:30,082
Now, here's another example of a completed
Fishbone diagram where you actually had

169
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:31,420
an event.

170
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,040
Doesn't really matter what kind of event.

171
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,969
So they elect to use the categories of
procedure, personnel,

172
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:42,072
reagent supplies, equipment, and
environment.

173
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:47,100
So, you look at those categories, and then
you drill down.

174
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,790
So, what are some of the causes.

175
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,030
If you look under procedure, the standard
operating procedure not clear.

176
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,470
Process is too complicated.

177
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:03,230
How many of us have, policy and procedures
in our organizations that actually,

178
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,750
nobody really has looked at in any great
detail, and

179
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:12,370
realize that the procedures are very
prescriptive, but not realistic.

180
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,276
And that's sometimes a, a, a real
challenge, because you would like to

181
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:19,867
follow the policy or the procedure, but if
they are not realistic or

182
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:23,269
they're complicated or they're fuzzy or
they're not clear or

183
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:26,986
just not communicated, you know, you can
be pretty much assured that

184
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:31,365
you're going to have variable outcome,
thereby leading to an adverse event.

185
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:35,184
So take a look at under the environment,
it's not uncommon for

186
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:40,050
us to have adverse events happening,
because the temperature is inappropriate.

187
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,472
The ambient noise is overwhelming us, one
of the big initiatives with

188
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:46,894
joint commission right now is looking at
clinical alarms, because we

189
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:50,896
know that a lot folks are, are distracted
by the fact that alarms are going off, or

190
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,894
they hear it all the time so they start to
ignore it.

191
00:12:53,894 --> 00:12:58,318
space, space is always a huge issue in
health care.

192
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:02,780
It doesn't matter if you're a large
organization or a small organization.

193
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:08,676
You're a clinic with just you as the
provider and one assistant in the front

194
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:14,396
office to a big surgical OR where there's
basically you know,

195
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:20,710
30, 40 operating rooms that's being that's
actively having cases.

196
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,660
You know, if you don't have enough space
to provide care, you know,

197
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,237
that can lead to adverse outcomes.

198
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:29,962
So those are the three tools that you want
to be aware of that you might be

199
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:33,787
exposed to as part of your root constant
analysis work,

200
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:38,820
the brainstorming, process mapping, and
cause-and-effects diagram.
