[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,020
In this next module, I'm going to tell you
about several different methods for

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,990
testing the proportional hazards
assumption.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,080
So, remember that now that we're dealing
with things over time,

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,270
the hazard rate can actually change over
time.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,080
So, we have to test whether or not the
relative difference between the hazard

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,140
rates of different groups, whether or not
that's reasonably constant over time.

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,190
So, you can imagine here's two hazard
functions over time.

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,470
For two groups.

10
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,230
When we calculate a single hazard ratio,

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,370
representing the relative difference
between these two groups,

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,630
we're assuming that it's reasonably
constant over time, that is, that sort of

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,930
the distance between these two lines
doesn't change too much over time.

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,880
That's the assumption.

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,880
You can imagine a situation where, because
again,

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,420
the hazard rates are allowed to kind of do
anything over time.

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,020
Maybe the hazard rate for one group looks
like this.

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,740
And the hazard rate over time for another
group looks like this.

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,530
Now clearly the hazard ratio very early in
the study is very close together,

20
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,250
very small.

21
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,500
Whereas it's huge later on in time.

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,476
And so, clearly it would be kind of unfair
to just report a single hazard ratio here,

23
00:01:14,476 --> 00:01:17,500
because there's something interesting
actually happening to

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,889
the hazard ratio over time.

25
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:20,426
So, it's going to to be important to

26
00:01:20,426 --> 00:01:23,390
evaluate the proportional hazards
assumption.

27
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,430
It's difficult to directly graph.

28
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,000
There are ways to try to directly graph
the hazard functions over time for

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,460
differing groups.

30
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,900
They're not perfect, though, and they
involve some assumption so we generally

31
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,950
try to get at the proportional hazard
assumption with some indirect methods.

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,750
I'm going to give you four different ways
to

33
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,410
evaluate the proportional hazards
assumption.

34
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,730
There's actually even more than this.

35
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,480
Some of these we've already talked about,
so

36
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,350
I already told you about the log, log
plots.

37
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,620
So, remember this is, you're going to take
the Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, and

38
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,150
you're going to take log, negative log of
those estimates and then just.

39
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,100
Plot those over time, for different
groups.

40
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,530
If the log negative plots, log negative
log plots are parallel,

41
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,890
that implies that the hazard functions are
also parallel.

42
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,820
And I like graphical methods for looking
at the proportional hazards function.

43
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,260
Sometimes it's a little fuzzy.

44
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,070
I mean, clearly if you have something that
looks like this, that's pretty good.

45
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,570
They're nice and parallel.

46
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,990
Clearly if you have something that looks
likes this, they're not parallel.

47
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,700
Sometimes there's a little bit of
interpretation involved because it's not

48
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,790
entirely clear you know is that parallel
enough.

49
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,290
But you have to make some kind of
judgement, but in general again I tend to

50
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,460
like graphical methods cause you can
really see the picture of what's going on.

51
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,280
One of the drawbacks of the log-log plots
is that sometimes you do get these

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,750
ones that are kind of ambiguous.

53
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,160
Another drawback is that if you've gotta
continuous predictor,

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,730
you have to divide it up into categories
in order to be able to make log-log plots.

55
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,270
So, a couple of drawbacks to that method.

56
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,300
I'll go over some examples of each of
these in turn.

57
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,940
I'm just going to kind of introduce them
quickly to you.

58
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,120
Second method that you can use is, you can
actually include

59
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,770
an interaction between your co-variant and
time in the model.

60
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,410
Because, that's what we mean by a
violation of proportional hazards.

61
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,610
We mean that it's, the hazard ratio is
actually.

62
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,510
Actually changing over time which is the
same as saying that the data is

63
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,787
changing over time.

64
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:14,870
So if you put in an interaction between
your co-variant in time, and that

65
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,240
turns out to be statistically significant
that would tell you that the data, and

66
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,270
therefore the hazard ratio is changing
over time.

67
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,190
So, that's another way to test and I'll go
over each one of these in detail in just.

68
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,130
Giving a brief introduction here.

69
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,500
I already showed you that you can plot the
Schoenfeld residuals against time to

70
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,420
check for proportional hazards.

71
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,210
That's again another plotting method.

72
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,480
And sometimes, people feel a little
uncomfortable with plotting methods.

73
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,750
Again, I like them, but, you know,
sometimes, you get something.

74
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,770
And, it looks like well, maybe there's a
small pattern over time.

75
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,790
It's a little bit unclear, so sometimes if
you would like a p value method,

76
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,830
that interaction with time is going to be
a p value method.

77
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,380
You can also get kind of a p value out the
Schoenfeld residuals.

78
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,460
You can take the Schoenfeld residuals and
just run a linear regression,

79
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,830
where the Schoenfeld residuals are your
outcome and time is your predictor.

80
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,950
And if that turns out to statistically
significant,

81
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,010
that would indicate that, in fact that the
slope here wasn't zero.

82
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,280
That the slope was something other than
zero, so again,

83
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,000
if you want to p-value test, you can do
that.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,790
Let me go over each one of these now in
turn.

85
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,610
Just to have some data here to work with,

86
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,470
recall that we had an example early in the
AIDS epidemic.

87
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,570
100 people who were infected with HIV.

88
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:32,560
Some are IV drug users and some and we had
different ages and both IV drug use and

89
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,710
age were very highly related to the rate
of death here.

90
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,910
The hazard ratio for IV drug use was 2.5.

91
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,460
For every one year increase in age, it was
1.096.

92
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,910
By fitting that Cox regression model, we
estimated a single hazard ration.

93
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,800
So, we are saying that there is one hazard
ratio, and

94
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,730
that it's relatively constant over time.

95
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,190
If we now wanted to check the proportional
hazards assumption for

96
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,020
both of those variables, I could do some
log-lot plots.

97
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,450
So, I next did some log-lot plots.

98
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,560
So over on the left hand side here is the
log-lot plot for age.

99
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,950
Now because age is a continuous variable,
if I want to do a log-lot plot.

100
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,380
Plot I"m actually going to have to chop
age up into categories.

101
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,870
So, I divided this into less than 30, 30
to 40 and greater than or equal to 40.

102
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,930
You can see, that these lines are nice and
parallel.

103
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,000
Again, if I chopped up age slightly
differently,

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,340
I might get slightly different results.

105
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,250
It's probably a good idea to try different
groupings, but in terms of a log-lot plot,

106
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,070
this is about as parallel as, as real data
gets so that looks.

107
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,160
Nice and reasonable.

108
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,620
That proportional hazards assumption
appears to be met there.

109
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:42,180
For IV drug use, this is the drug users,
and then this one is the non drug users.

110
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,570
What you'll notice here is that the drug
users' line of

111
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,790
their plot ends really quickly into the
study.

112
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,370
That's because all of them died all very
quickly when, when they were HIV positive.

113
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,730
And we're also an IV drug user, they tend
to die very quickly so

114
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,930
that line doesn't extend anymore.

115
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,110
But if you look at the two lines,

116
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,710
they look reasonable parallel it's perhaps
they are separating a little bit over

117
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,200
time they're getting a little bit farther
apart so they're not perfectly parallel.

118
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,420
But again as real data go,

119
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,820
that probably is very reasonable in terms
of the proportional hazards assumption.

120
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,650
So both of those, I would say, meet the
proportional hazards assumption.

121
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,450
Now, just to give you one that actually
doesn't meet

122
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,740
the proportional hazards assumption, to
show you what it would look like,

123
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,640
I'm going to introduce now another example
from Hosmer and Lemeshow.

124
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,070
These were some data that were collected
from a randomized trial, and

125
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,060
these were drug addicted people,

126
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,260
who were randomized to two different
courses of treatment: a long.

127
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,690
A treatment plan and a short treatment
plan, and there was, 628 was the n here.

128
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,760
The outcome here is time-to-relapse, so
they're getting tre, treated for

129
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,010
their drug addiction.

130
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:49,750
As soon as they relapse and start using
again, that's the, time-to-relapse here.

131
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,920
There were different predictors that they
had, the one we're going to focus on, for

132
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,690
the purposes of this module, is just which
treatment group they were randomized to?

133
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,948
There were other predictors as well.

134
00:06:57,948 --> 00:07:01,985
Here's the Kaplan-Meier curve for the two
randomization groups.

135
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:04,980
So, this top line here is the.

136
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,350
Those that were randomized to the longer
course of treatment.

137
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,174
The bottom line here,

138
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:15,656
are those that were randomized to the
shorter course of treatment.

139
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:18,490
And the log ring test here is significant.

140
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,730
It looks like there was an advantage here
to be, to being randomized to

141
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,760
the long course because they're not
relapsing quite as quickly.

142
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,810
I mean, it does look like a lot of people
did relapse.

143
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,280
But the longer course seem to take a
little bit longer at least to relapse.

144
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,230
It's hard to just look at the Kaplan–Meier
plots and

145
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,760
make any inferences, about the
proportional hazards assumption though.

146
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,431
You need to actually translate this into
the log-log plot.

147
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:43,443
So, then [INAUDIBLE] data and tell, and
plotted the log-lot plots for

148
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:44,450
the two groups.

149
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,990
So here's the log-lot plot for the two
groups here.

150
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,330
And what you'll notice is that there does
indeed a, a.

151
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,712
Seem to be some violation of proportional
hazards, though,

152
00:07:53,712 --> 00:08:00,160
the plot clearly crosses here, and then
has some separation later on,

153
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,810
with the control group here being higher
than the treatment group.

154
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,210
So, this plot, again if the lines crossed
that's

155
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,750
usually an indication of a violation of
proportional hazards, this one in

156
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,330
fact does violate proportional hazards
using many methods to look at these data.

157
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,240
I just do, do want to point out that every
now and then you'll see.

158
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,970
A log-lot plot that looks something like
this,

159
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,440
where they kind of like seem to be
crossing all over the place.

160
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,540
But be a little bit careful,

161
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,460
that doesn't necessarily mean you have a
violation of the proportional hazards.

162
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,190
If they're just kind of crossing like
this,

163
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,020
what that might mean is that there's
actually no difference between the groups.

164
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,720
That capillary minor curves should also be
really close.

165
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,920
And then of course, when there's no
difference between the groups, the,

166
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,930
the plots might go back and forth a little
bit.

167
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,020
But this really indicates no difference
between the groups,

168
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,300
rather than a violation of proportional
hazard.

169
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,930
So, just be aware that you might see
plots, log-log plots that look like that.

170
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,010
So, the second way to test a proportional
hazards assumption is actually just to

171
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,300
enter in to your Cox Regression model an
interaction.

172
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,150
Between time and that the co-variate that
you're trying to test this assumption for.

173
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,160
So, it's going to look something like
this.

174
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,590
So, you're going to take your covariate of
interest, I've labelled it x here,

175
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,379
whether this be age or treatment group or
IV drug use.

176
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,800
You interact that co-variant with time,
and

177
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,930
then you're going to have a beta in the
model that represents the interaction.

178
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,070
If that interaction beta is statistically
significant,

179
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,210
that would indicate that indeed the beta.

180
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,640
For your predictor is changing over time,
and

181
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,180
therefore that you have violated
proportional hazards, and

182
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,090
you can see that here, I can just factor
out the x from both of these.

183
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,430
So, what this is saying is that that this
is significantly different from zero,

184
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,140
this interaction beta, then the beta for

185
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,460
x, whatever x is here, is not static over
time.

186
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,010
It's increasing or decreasing with time.

187
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,300
This is again the time interaction
coefficient.

188
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,320
And again, you're looking for statistical
significance here.

189
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,850
Keep in mind that as with any p-value
tests, a really huge sample is going to be

190
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,230
likely to make everything is going to come
out significant, or

191
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,010
a really small sample might miss
statistical significance.

192
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,780
So, keep in mind that with any p value
test,

193
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,950
you always have to think about how to
sample size factor into this.

194
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,050
That's why I often prefer these graphical
methods.

195
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,160
Now notice that if the interaction term,
if that comes out to be negative,

196
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,220
that indicates that beta is decreasing
linearly with time.

197
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,400
Whereas if this term turns out to be
positive, that would indicate that your

198
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,910
beta for the co-variate interest is
increasing linearly with time.

199
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,998
By just putting this time.

200
00:10:34,998 --> 00:10:38,820
By variable co-variant interaction term in
the model.

201
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,430
It not only evaluates proportional
hazards, but

202
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,040
it could be one way to deal with
proportional hazard violations.

203
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,290
So, it it turns out that you're violating
the proportional hazard assumption,

204
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,450
you could leave.

205
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,000
That interaction term in the model.

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,990
It is assuming a particular form, for the
change in the hazard ratio over time.

207
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,460
It's assuming that your beta is always
going up or always going down by the same

208
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,950
amount over time, so that may be true for
some cases where there's a violation of

209
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,780
proportional hazards, and it may not be
true for others.

210
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,250
But, it is something to think about that
it could be one way to correct, for

211
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,120
violations of proportional hazards.

212
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,070
As well as to test for it.

213
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,880
So, let me just give some examples of what
I mean here.

214
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,220
So, I ran two models.

215
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,610
The first model is from the HIV data, and

216
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,760
I put age in the model, which we already
saw with the log-log plot,

217
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,910
looked like it, you know, didn't violate
proportional hazards at all.

218
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,690
And then I put in interaction between age
and time.

219
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,460
The p-value for this interaction term is
clearly non-significant, so

220
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,340
it doesn't look like there's any violation
of proportional hazards here.

221
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,260
The second model here, I fit on the drug
treatment,

222
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,890
that randomized trial data set was 628
people.

223
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,990
I put into the model the.

224
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,680
Treatment randomization,

225
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,750
whether you were assigned to the long
course of treatment or the short course.

226
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,850
And then an interaction between your
treatment group and time.

227
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,140
And you'll notice that the interaction
between treatment, and

228
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,470
time was clearly statistically
significant.

229
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,120
So, that's indicating that in fact we do
violate proportional hazards here.

230
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,198
So, we already had evidence from the
log-log plot of evaluation of

231
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,680
proportional hazards.

232
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,850
This is contributing to us believing that
indeed we are this variable,

233
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,560
the treatment variable, does violate
proportional hazards.

234
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:26,760
I've already mentioned that the Schoenfeld
residuals, if proportional hazards is met,

235
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,720
will have no pattern over time when you
plot them over time.

236
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,490
So, if you see a distinct pattern when you
plot the Schoenfeld residuals against

237
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,660
time for a particular co-variant,

238
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,770
that would indicate a violation of
proportional hazards.

239
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,120
And I'll just give a couple examples,

240
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,980
I've actually shown this a little bit
already but here's an example,

241
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,610
I plotted for the HIV data the Schoenfeld
residuals for age against time.

242
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,630
And remember.

243
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,600
That we only get a Schoenfeld residual for
every person who had an event.

244
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,500
So, there's a hundred people in this data
set, but

245
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,520
we actually have less than a hundred data
points on the graph.

246
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,980
We plot those against time.

247
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,920
It looks you know, right around, it looks
like you know,

248
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,970
when I fit a line to these data, it's nice
the slope is very close to zero.

249
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,120
So that would indicate that there's no
pattern with time,

250
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,740
no violation of proportional hazards here.

251
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,190
In contrast, let me take the data from
that randomized trial of

252
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,910
drug addiction treatment.

253
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:29,540
I am plotting the Schoenfeld residuals
here, for treatment group against time.

254
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,940
It's a little hard to see because this is
a binary variable, and

255
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,990
therefore we kind of get just two stripes
of residuals, but when I fit a nice

256
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,770
smooth line to these plots, into these
dots, what you see is that I do, indeed.

257
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,040
Have some pattern over time where the
Schoenfeld residuals appear to be

258
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,410
increasing with time.

259
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,670
So that, again, would suggest that we have
a violation of proportional hazards for

260
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,520
this variable.

261
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,150
Now, very related to the Schoenfeld
residual plots is we

262
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,020
can regress the Schoenfeld residuals
against time in a linear regression.

263
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,600
And again, I, I like the plotting methods,
but if you're kind of.

264
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,530
If you get a plot and you're kind of
unsure from the plot.

265
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,330
You can additionally run a linear
regression, to see whether or

266
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,410
not, at least in a linear regression.

267
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,390
The slope of this line, is significantly
different than zero.

268
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,240
So, here is the one for age, from the HIV
data, against time.

269
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,210
I mean it's clear from the graphic here
that there's no pattern across time.

270
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,070
So, we probably don't need to additionally
run the regression here.

271
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,270
But you can do it.

272
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,670
The outcome will be the show and tell of
residuals.

273
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,730
And my predictor will be time.

274
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,040
And this will be a regular older liner
regression.

275
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,730
So I ran my linear regression.

276
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,860
I look at the data for time.

277
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,250
And clearly, the p value for time is
totally non significant.

278
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,010
This looks like a really, really flat
life.

279
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,980
So, no violation of proportional hazards
apparent here.

280
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,680
In contrast, I can take the Shoenfeld
residuals for

281
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,220
that treatment group in the drug addiction
treatments.

282
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,880
Study, and I can regress that against
time, so

283
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,060
I'd have my residuals again, and time as
the predictor in a linear regression,

284
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,540
and if I go and look at the beta and the
p-value here for this regression,

285
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,830
the p-value for time is clearly
statistically significant.

286
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,460
So, that would again point to the fact
that proportional hazards, is violated for

287
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,600
this treatment variable.

288
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,530
So, again there's many different ways to
test for proportional hazards,

289
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:25,150
sometimes it's just really clear from the
log log plot and you can stop there.

290
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,400
Sometimes you look at the log-log plot and
you're not sure.

291
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,060
So you might want to try some of these
other methods.

292
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,320
But just to summarize we could examine the
law log-log plots.

293
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,140
Parallel lines mean we have proportional
hazards.

294
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,060
Crossing lines, or

295
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,180
nearly crossing lines, tell us that we
violate proportional hazards.

296
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,130
The drawback here, is was that we could
only use categorical predictors or

297
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,940
we'd have to chop our continuous
predictors into some sort of

298
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,580
category just to be able to do those
plots.

299
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,730
We can also include an interaction with
time in the model,

300
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,270
if that interaction time is non
significant, then there's no apparent

301
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:59,240
violation of proportional hazards, if we
get a significant interaction coefficient

302
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,230
that would indicate a violation of
proportional hazards.

303
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,630
And in fact, there may be, it may turn out
that that's a way to correct for

304
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,930
the violation of proportional hazard,

305
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,930
is just to leave that interaction term in
the model.

306
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,590
That's going to work for

307
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,800
some situations but not for all, because
that then is assuming that

308
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,150
there's a particular way in which the
hazard ratio is changing over time.

309
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,298
We can plot the Schoenfeld residuals
against time and look for

310
00:16:21,298 --> 00:16:22,810
non-random patterns, non-random.

311
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,940
Patterns would indicate violations of
proportional hazards,

312
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,670
and then finally we could actually take
those Shoenfeld residuals and

313
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,150
regress them against time in a linear
regression.

314
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:36,220
If our time variable turns out to be
statistically significant that would

315
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,940
indicate a violation of proportional
hazards whereas non-significance would

316
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,170
indicate no evidence of a, a violation of
that assumption.
