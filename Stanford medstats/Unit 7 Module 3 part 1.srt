1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,170
In this next module,

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,720
I'm going to talk about the alternative
test that you can use.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,244
Instead of the ttest and

4
00:00:14,244 --> 00:00:17,530
ANOVA, when you violate the assumptions of
ttest and ANOVA.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,940
These are called non-parametric tests.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,682
I'm going to be talking in this module
about Wilcoxon sign-rank,

7
00:00:24,682 --> 00:00:27,420
Wilcoxon rank-sum and Kruskal-Wallis test.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,840
These are all what's called non-parametric
statistics.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,750
And all we mean by non-parametric is that
we're not estimating any parameters.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,790
So, when you do a ttest or ANOVA, you're
estimating the means in

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,010
those different groups and the standard
deviations in those different groups.

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,700
We're not going to be estimating any
parameters like that in the Wilcoxon and

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,100
the Kruskal-Wallis test.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,990
We're just going to get a p-value at the
end of the day.

15
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,571
So, there won't be any estimation
involved, only hypothesis testing.

16
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:55,783
So, I'll start here with the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test.

17
00:00:55,783 --> 00:00:57,316
Because actually, in very,

18
00:00:57,316 --> 00:01:01,331
the very first week of this course, we saw
a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

19
00:01:01,331 --> 00:01:03,120
So, I'm going to use that same example
now.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,180
The Wilcoxon rank-sum test is used as the
alternative to the two sample ttest.

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,150
When you have a small sample, and you have
a non-normally distributed outcome.

22
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,330
So, if you have a small sample and

23
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,330
it looks like your outcome variable is not
normally distributed.

24
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,390
You might choose to, instead of running a
ttest, to run a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

25
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,210
Remember that we had this hypothetical
weight loss trial that I showed you in

26
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,140
the very first week of the course.

27
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,260
Ten dieters were randomized to follow diet
one, and

28
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,580
ten dieters were randomly assigned to
follow diet two.

29
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,520
Group one lost an average of 34.5 pounds.

30
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,430
Group two lost an average of 18.5 pounds.

31
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,900
And you might just look at those numbers,
and think that diet one is better.

32
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,420
The mean is higher, the mean weight loss
is higher in group one.

33
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,071
That would be a natural conclusion, but
let's look at the data more closely.

34
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:52,915
When you look at the histogram for diet
two,

35
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:58,190
turns out that the mean was a loss of 18.5
pounds, the median is a loss of 19 pounds.

36
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:03,160
It's pretty even, you know, it's not
exactly a normal curve, but

37
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,670
it might be close enough to a normal
distribution.

38
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,130
However, when you look at the histogram,
the raw data from diet one.

39
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:14,450
It turns out that there was one person in
that group of ten, who lost 300 pounds.

40
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,490
So, the mean weight loss was huge, 34.5
pounds.

41
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,790
But that's mostly driven by that one
person.

42
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,140
The median loss was only 4.5 pounds.

43
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,020
If you were to look at these data and were
to analyze these data using a two

44
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,060
sample ttest, you would not find a
significant difference between the groups.

45
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,210
Now, let's look at the raw data.

46
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,720
Here's diet one.

47
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,380
We can actually look at the numbers
because there's only 10

48
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,205
people in each diet.

49
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:41,950
And here's the weight loss in pounds, the
change in weight in pounds.

50
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,260
So, for example, one person gained four
pounds, one person lost 300 pounds,

51
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,583
that's for diet one.

52
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,690
For diet two, here are the changes in
weights.

53
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,840
You'll notice that if you look at the raw
data,

54
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,830
there's a much more consistent weight loss
in diet two.

55
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,010
If I were going to be recommending a diet
to patient it

56
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,210
seems like everybody in diet two lost a
pretty good chunk of weight.

57
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,820
Whereas, diet one it was much more
variable, one person did great.

58
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,750
But there were a lot of people who didn't
do as terrific on diet one.

59
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,410
So if I'm looking at the data now, I might
just intuitively,

60
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,160
instinctively think well diet two seems
somewhat better.

61
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,776
We can actually apply a statistical test
to evaluate which diet is better.

62
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:27,200
We're going to apply something called the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,600
It's also sometimes called the
Mann-Whitney U test.

64
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,351
I would prefer the term Wilcoxon rank-sum
test,

65
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:34,320
because rank-sum test tells you exactly
what it does.

66
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,275
You rank the data and then you sum it.

67
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:39,551
So, we want to know if there is a
difference in

68
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:42,099
weight loss between the two diets.

69
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:45,011
The outcome variable is weight change.

70
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:46,650
It is a continuous variable.

71
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,960
However, it is not a normally distributed
variable.

72
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,160
If you look at those histograms, there is
a huge left tail for diet one.

73
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,090
So, it might have been normally
distributed, but

74
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,090
we had that one outlier which made it a
non-normal distribution.

75
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,810
We have a small n, only 10 in each group.

76
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,110
So, we have to worry about the normality
assumption here.

77
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,270
A ttest is not going to be appropriate
here.

78
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,510
It's also not going to be appropriate to
just throw out the one weight,

79
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,040
the one person who lost a lot of weight in
diet one.

80
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,210
Because that person's a real person who
lost a lot of weight,

81
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,560
we want to give them credit for that.

82
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,070
We don't want to just throw out that
outlier.

83
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,880
But Wilcoxon rank-sum test can keep the
outlier in.

84
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,530
Are the observations correlated?

85
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,290
No, we have independent groups here.

86
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,180
Are groups being compared?

87
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,760
Yes, and how many are being compared?

88
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,270
There's two groups.

89
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,960
Normally we would, if it weren't for the
violation of the normal,

90
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,930
the normality assumption, we would be
doing a two sample ttest.

91
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,560
But, because we've violated the normality
assumption here,

92
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,380
our outcome variable is not normally
distributed.

93
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,840
We have have small n, we're going to
choose for the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

94
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,648
Again, another it is also called the
Mann-Whitney U test, those are equivalent.

95
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:55,776
So, first up in the rank-sum test is just
to rank the data.

96
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:57,952
We're going to take all, everybody, and

97
00:04:57,952 --> 00:05:01,488
we're going to ignore the group they're in
the for the moment.

98
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:03,880
We're going to order the diets.

99
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,090
Order the weight losses ignoring diet.

100
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,520
So, we're going to order from the worst
weight loss, to the best weight loss.

101
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,190
The person who lost the least is the
person who gained four pounds.

102
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:14,890
They get a rank of one.

103
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:15,880
The person who did the best,

104
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,150
the person who lost 300 pounds, they get a
rank of 20.

105
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,140
Then, we rank everybody else in between.

106
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,260
Again, ignoring groups.

107
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,510
So, the ranks both groups can have, both a
sense of ranks.

108
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,330
You'll notice just looking at the ranks,

109
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,400
that most of the high ranks go to diet
two.

110
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,920
So we rank the data, ignoring which group
people are in,

111
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,950
from the lowest to the highest 1 to 20.

112
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,350
Notice, that we are including the person
who lost the 300 pounds.

113
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,560
They're getting the highest credit.

114
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,670
They're getting that highest rank of 20.

115
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,260
But a difference between, the difference
between 19 and 20 is much,

116
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,420
much smaller than the difference between
negative 30 and negative 300.

117
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,970
So, that outlier is not having so much
Influence here.

118
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,140
By looking at ranks data,

119
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,820
we're essentially comparing the medians
rather than comparing the means.

120
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,600
We then sum the ranks within each group.

121
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,150
So, we're going to sum the ranks for group
one, comes out to be 73.

122
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:08,443
We're going to sum the ranks for group
two, that comes out to be 137.

123
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:12,270
The one with the bigger sum of the rank is
going to be the better diet.

124
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,950
What the Wilcoxon rank-sum test then does
is it looks at those

125
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:22,580
sums of the ranks, and tells you whether
or not they're statistically different.

126
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,780
This is a little tricky if you have
different sample sizes, right?

127
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,660
What if one group only had five people and
the other group had 20 people.

128
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,090
Well, of course, the sum of the ranks is
going to be higher for the bigger group.

129
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,720
So, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test accounts
for differences in sample sizes as well.

130
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,080
Theory of the same sample size.

131
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,730
You just need to answer the question, is
137 statistically different than 73?

132
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,310
And in fact, when we apply that test,

133
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,150
it does turn out that the p-value here
comes out to be statistically significant.

134
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,960
It actually shows us that diet two is
superior to diet one,

135
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,210
despite the fact that the mean weight loss
was higher in diet one.

136
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,370
So, by applying the correct statistical
test here,

137
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,140
we are able to say that diet two is
superior.

138
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,190
I'm not going to go into the nitty gritty
details of the actual

139
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,274
mathematical calculations of
distinguishing that 73 from that 170, 37.

140
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:15,016
If you want the details on that, there is
an optional material on that for you.

141
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:19,192
Now, I want to briefly review the Wilcoxon
sign-rank test.

142
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:23,629
This is the non-parametric alternative to
the paired ttest.

143
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:30,010
Recall that we talked last week about a
randomized trial DHA oil to treat eczema.

144
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,570
Here's a table, a figure from that trial.

145
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:38,640
I showed you part B from that trial last
week.

146
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,730
There is a bunch of p-values on this
figure,

147
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,370
and you can see where do those p-values
come from?

148
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,190
Well, these are showing the p-values for
whether or

149
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,850
not the placebo group and the DHA group.

150
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,260
The control group and the DHA group.

151
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,610
Whether or not their score add scores,

152
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,448
went down at all a significant amount over
time.

153
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:04,890
So, all the p values I've circled here
came from Wilcoxon sign-rank tests.

154
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,080
So, when you're doing the within group
comparison,

155
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,360
over time those p-values come from the
Wilcoxon sign-rank test.

156
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,010
Here, we were comparing only week zero to
week eight, so

157
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,880
we're actually only comparing two time
points.

158
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,950
The score add index, the score add score
turns out to be non-normally distributed.

159
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,090
Our sample size was small here.

160
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,270
We only had 53 people, so we're going to
want to use a non-parametric equivalent to

161
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,580
the pair ttest, rather than use the pair
ttest.

162
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,280
So again, how did I get there?

163
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,140
I wanted to know whether or not the
patients improved in SCORAD score from

164
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,840
baseline to eight weeks, just two time
points.

165
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,590
The outcome variable's SCORAD, the
severity score of eczema.

166
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,747
It is a continuous variable, but it is not
normally distributed, and

167
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:47,730
we they have small numbers, so we cannot
apply a ttest here.

168
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,400
Are the observations correlated?

169
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,859
Yes, it's the same people before and
after.

170
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:54,740
So, we also have correlated data here.

171
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,790
So, we would normally do a paired ttest.

172
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,850
But because we violated the normality
assumption,

173
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,810
we're going to use the non-parametric
equivalent to the pair ttest,

174
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,230
which is the Wilcoxon sign-rank test.

175
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,750
There's only two time points being
compared,

176
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:12,630
which is why we can used a pair two test
or a Wilcoxon sign-rank test.

177
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,210
The mechanics or the Wilcoxon sign-rank
test just briefly,

178
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,255
it's very similar to the Wilcoxon rank-sum
test.

179
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:20,530
It's going to involve some ranking.

180
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:24,140
Except this time, it's sort of, [COUGH]
we're going to be looking at signs,

181
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,590
the signs, rather than at two groups.

182
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,870
So, you're going to calculate the change
in SCORAD score for each participant.

183
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,750
So, just like what you do for

184
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,080
the pair ttest, everybody has an
improvement score, change score.

185
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,660
You then rank the absolute values of the
changes in SCORAD score,

186
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,090
from the smallest to the largest.

187
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,000
So, the person who had

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,832
the biggest absolute change would get the
biggest rank.

189
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:50,530
We're ignoring sign for

190
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,790
the minute, [COUGH] the null hypothesis
here is that there's no change.

191
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,560
We're ignoring sign for the minute.

192
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,049
We would then add up the ranks, sum up the
ranks from the people who improved.

193
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:06,556
That's the people who would have a
negative sign.

194
00:10:06,556 --> 00:10:07,550
And we would add up the ranks from the
people who got worse.

195
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,860
That's the people who had a positive sign.

196
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,770
So, that's where the sign part comes in.

197
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,305
We're comparing people who improved to
people who got worse.

198
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:17,058
Does either sum of the ranks dominate.

199
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:22,570
The Wilcoxon sign-rank test compares these
values to determine

200
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:28,652
whether the improvements significantly
exceeded the declines or vice versa.

201
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:32,180
Remember, the null hypothesis here is that
there is no change.

202
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,230
So, we just want to know if there is a
significant change in either direction,

203
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,440
either going up or going down.

204
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,302
If we, and under the null, you'd expect
there is some of

205
00:10:39,302 --> 00:10:42,810
the ranks to be about equal for the
negatives as for the positives.

206
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,270
If you violate the null, if you reject the
null, that would suggest that there

207
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,970
was either a significant improvement or a
significant decline.

208
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,130
And all we're asking in this particular
example is whether or

209
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:57,120
not there was a significant improvement
over time, in the DHA group alone or

210
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,270
in the control group alone.

211
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:04,123
So, and we saw that, indeed, these
p-values the p-value for

212
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:06,560
the DHA group from the Wilcoxon sign-rank
test,

213
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,420
that p-value comes from the Wilcoxon
sign-rank test.

214
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,250
That came out significant the p-value from
the Wilcoxon sign-rank test

215
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,230
applied just to the control group, did not
come out significant.

216
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,480
So, those within group change was
significant for the DHA group, but

217
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,870
not significant for the control group.

218
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,240
But, the p-value that really mattered here
is not the within group changes,

219
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,140
but the p-value we should have cared about
here is the between group difference.

220
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,430
Did the DHA group improve more than the
control group?

221
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,400
To get that p-value, we had to apply a
Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

222
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,839
The between group to compare the two
groups and

223
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,740
their improvement in SCORAD scores, and
that came out to be non-significant.

224
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,320
So, as we said, even though within group
improvement, it,

225
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,260
it is significant in one group but not the
other.

226
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,911
It doesn't mean that the between group
differences are going to be significant.

227
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:58,630
And they weren't here.

228
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,500
All of those were done.

229
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,240
All those p-value were done by
non-parametric because the SCORAD score is

230
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,460
not normally distributed.

231
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,513
Finally if you want, if you want to do
compare two or

232
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:19,148
more groups, and you have a non normally
distributed outcome variable.

233
00:12:19,148 --> 00:12:22,970
The non non-parametric equivalent to the
ANOVA is

234
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,680
something called the Kruskal-Wallis test.

235
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,675
And it basically, I'm not going to go over
the mechanics,

236
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:30,209
because it basically works in the exact
same way as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

237
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,850
You're going to rank everybody ignoring
group, and

238
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,619
then your going to sum up the ranks within
the groups and sum outcome.
