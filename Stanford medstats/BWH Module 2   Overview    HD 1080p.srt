[MUSIC].

3
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:25,580
Hi, I'm doctor, Larry Chu.

4
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,380
>> Hi, I'm doctor, Lauren Cornella.

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,510
>> And I'm doctor, John Fox.

6
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,710
>> Now in this segment,

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,560
we're going to talk about an overview of
the field of cardiac anesthesiology.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,540
Now what I'd like to do is to have both
Lauren and John have a little discussion.

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,880
I want you to tell me a little bit about,
the overview of cardiac anesthesiology.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,180
What does, what is the practice of cardiac
anesthesia,

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,210
what do cardiac anesthesiologist do?

12
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,800
Tell me a little bit about why you guys
got into the field.

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,590
And, of course, I also want to know a
little bit about,

14
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,250
the future of the specialty.

15
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,290
>> Well, Lauren, Doctor Chu, I got into
the specialty because it was fun.

16
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,700
I was able to, take care of really
critically ill patients.

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,460
I was able to learn and study the
physiology, the cardiovascular physiology.

18
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,130
And ultimately, I was able to participate
in

19
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,800
operations where the patients got better.

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,200
Where there was, indeed, a cure, if you
will.

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,520
Like aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,550
Once you operated on that and fixed the
valve, the patients did a lot better.

23
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,370
It followed, it, my personality.

24
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:41,420
That was what I had, what I found the best
of it, of, of cardiac anesthesiology.

25
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,580
additionally, it gave me the confidence to
take care of

26
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,410
any ill patient throughout the operating
suite.

27
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,350
Once you've done a cardiac anesthesia
rotation, and

28
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,890
you've learned about the medications, the
vasoactive and vasodilator drugs.

29
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:04,380
That you could translate to any other
patient for any other procedure.

30
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,490
And that, to me, was, was, was great.

31
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,810
The other thing I enjoy about the cardiac
anesthesia area

32
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,620
is the teamwork that's involved.

33
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,840
You get really close with the individuals
that are there.

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,170
And understand what, what, what happens,
how you can take care of individuals.

35
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,840
It's really, as I said, I found it really
fun.

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,490
>> I went into cardiac anesthesia for

37
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,600
many of the same reasons that John did,
that you did.

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,300
I thought, what attracted me was the
ability to

39
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,420
take care of really sick patients.

40
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,450
I wanted to be very comfortable taking
care of some of the sickest patients in

41
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,780
the operating room.

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,742
And I wanted to be comfortable with a lot
of different hemodynamic drugs.

43
00:02:43,742 --> 00:02:46,690
I love the monitors that we use in cardiac
anesthesia.

44
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,800
And so, I saw it not only as a cardiac
anesthesia fellowship, but

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,950
maybe a fellowship in just taking care of
some of our sickest patients

46
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,820
in the operating room, and I knew that I
would translate some of

47
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,780
those skills to my practice in the
non-cardiac ORs.

48
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,530
I also saw how much trans-esophageal echo
was such a big part

49
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,390
of the cardiac anesthesia specialty, and

50
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,970
I thought that it was absolutely just a
really important skill to learn.

51
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,750
I saw the cardiac anesthesiologists that I
was working with making decisions about

52
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,850
the hemodynamic status of the patient,
discussing the surgical aspects of

53
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,920
the valve replacement or whatever we were
doing with the surgeons.

54
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,510
And I saw that transesophageal echo was
being used so

55
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,802
much more in the non-cardiac ORs to answer
really different, difficult inter

56
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:37,930
operative questions that I wanted to
become an expert in transesophageal echo.

57
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,890
So I thought that that was really an
important aspect, and,

58
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,200
I was excited to learn more about that.

59
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,120
>> And what Lauren is pointing out is the
actual teamwork approach that we end up

60
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,480
doing, in, in, as a cardiac
anesthesiologist.

61
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,170
It becomes, and I will add parenthetically
that when I started in

62
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,070
cardiac anesthesiology there was no
transesophageal echo.

63
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,000
Innovations come really quickly in the
cardiac anesthesia realm,

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,680
brought on by the surgeons, brought on by
the cardio, cardiologists, and

65
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,830
the other cardiovascular specialists who
we have the pleasure of working with.

66
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,680
And I know for a fact that there are
multiple innovations that

67
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,790
are happening right now in, in cardiac
anesthesia.

68
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,440
And I know Lauren and

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,190
I spent a lot of time in the
electrophysiology lab and in the cath lab.

70
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,920
I think that speak to Doctor Chu's
question of where we

71
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,880
think the specialty is going.

72
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,170
I think that, like John says, the
innovations in cardiac anesthesia,

73
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:40,400
cardiology, cardiac surgery, are rapidly
becoming more and more complex and we,

74
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,630
as cardiac anesthesiologists, are at the
center of a lot of those procedures.

75
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,580
So, just as we're maintaining our presence
in the cardiac anesthesia ORs.

76
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,310
We're in the electrophysiology lab.

77
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,970
We're in the cath lab.

78
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,130
We're up in the cardiac surgery ICUs, and
so

79
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,840
I think our role is expanding very rapidly
in future in

80
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,340
terms of kind of the perioperative care of
the cardiac patients.

81
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:01,860
>> Absolutely.

82
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,371
>> And we are really an integral part of
that, and so

83
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:08,530
I'm really excited to see that develop in,
you know, 5, 10, 15 years.

84
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,200
>> And we're taking the lessons we've
learned in the cardiac anesthesia

85
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:18,211
operating room, in terms of team work,
check lists, the surgical props,

86
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:24,110
and advancing that, and putting that into
cath lab and the electrophysiology area.

87
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:30,750
A final point, another point is a lot
adults now are getting, a lot

88
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,750
of patients are getting into adulthood who
have congenital heart disease.

89
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,329
And so, cardiac anesthesiology will allow
you a wide variety of specialties,

90
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:42,420
depending on your interest.

91
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,791
If you're interested in congenital heart
disease, you can learn about that,

92
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:50,381
because the advantage the, that your
knowledge will be needed as

93
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:54,920
these patients become adults and require
non-cardiac surgery.

94
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,660
>> Yeah, I think, just, this specialty is
really going to expand within cardiac

95
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,280
surgery, cardiac anesthesia, and you're
also going to be taking care of a lot of

96
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,220
patients in the non-cardiac ORs that have
been patients of ours in the cardiac OR.

97
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,005
So I think, I see it as a really great
opportunity to become very

98
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,790
well-rounded anesthesiologists, and

99
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,200
very confident taking care of some of our
sickest patients.

100
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,420
>> Could not agree more.

101
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,430
>> Wonderful.

102
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,140
I mean, I am so excited about cardiac
anesthesia, as a specialty, and

103
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,520
you talk about innovation.

104
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,947
This course itself is another example of
cardiac anesthesia taking

105
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:34,170
the initiative and innovation for online
learning and education.

106
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:39,150
so, I'm really excited about this course
and I think you guys will be too,

107
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,580
so we look forward to seeing you, at our
next episode.

108
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,990
See you soon!
