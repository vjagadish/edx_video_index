1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,320
Welcome to the third and final R video
module.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,620
In this session,

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,970
we'll be reviewing the problems from the
third set of R/deducer exercises.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,630
And as before we'll be working with the
same data set,

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,031
mock class data which is provided to you
in Excel format on the class website.

6
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:31,674
So I'm going to start off by opening

7
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:37,366
Deducer and loading the data.

8
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:40,460
[SOUND] So again we have our 2 familiar
windows here, the console window and

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,580
the demo-viewer window, and I'm going to
click on Open Data and

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,480
navigate to where I saved.

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,239
Our data set on my computer, which happens
to be on the Desktop.

12
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,535
And, I'm going to wait for r to load the
data.

13
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:56,291
Great.

14
00:00:56,291 --> 00:01:00,820
So, now that the data's been loaded, and

15
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,120
I've checked to make sure that everything
looks correct to which it does.

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,820
We're ready to begin the exercise.

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,620
The first question asks for

18
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:15,080
the piercing correlation coefficient
between the variables politics and Obama.

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,030
It asks us about the p value for this
correlation coefficient.

20
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,615
And it also asks us to draw a scatter plot
for this data.

21
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:29,945
So the way I'm going to do this is to go
to Analysis Correlation.

22
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:39,650
And I'm going to drag over Both politics
and Obama into the variables box.

23
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:44,830
I want to point out that the box below it
will correlate that variable with

24
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,110
all the variables in the box named
variables.

25
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:56,180
So for example, if I put in let's say as
an example, varsity.

26
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,760
It would correlate varsity with politics.

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,705
And varsity with Obama.

28
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:02,270
Okay?

29
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,020
So that's another option for you to use if
you want to.

30
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,390
So I want to scatter plot.

31
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,472
So I'm going to go to Plots.

32
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:10,060
Here.

33
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,620
I'm going to select Scatterplots.

34
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,390
And I'm going to unselect common axis.

35
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,550
I think it's actually a little bit easier
to interpret when you don't have a lot of

36
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,090
variables correlating with each other.

37
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,270
To not have a common axis.

38
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,780
So, then I'm going to hit Okay.

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,060
I'm curious about what Options has, so I'm
going to click on that now.

40
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,730
I see that it has options for different
sets of output that we want.

41
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,110
So this has options for whether we want a
two sided P value or

42
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,040
a one sided P value, and what confidence
level we want our output to be set at,

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,330
and then of course the N, the confidence
interval.

44
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,949
The test statistic and the P-value.

45
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:53,620
We want all of these in our output, so I'm
going to leave them checked.

46
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,730
Pearson's correlation is selected by
default, so that's good.

47
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,815
And we are ready to run our test.

48
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:04,340
So you'll notice a few things happen here.

49
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,890
First of all, Deducer generated a few
scatter plots First,

50
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,980
and then we also have our output on the
left-hand side in the console window here.

51
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,915
Just scrolled up a little bit to see it.

52
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:20,990
So a few things to notice.

53
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:29,324
The output is structured to correlate with
the scatter plots on the right-hand side.

54
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:34,450
So, you'll notice that the data for let's
say Obama being on the X axis and

55
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:40,360
politics being on the Y axis is in the
upper right hand corner of the output,

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,500
and that same scatter plot is in the upper
right hand corner of

57
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,810
the correlation array on the right hand
side of the screen.

58
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,830
So, that's how to read this.

59
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,750
And so, what we're interested And is
looking at the correlation coefficient.

60
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,010
The correlation coefficient is 0.7789.

61
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:05,990
The p value is very low, so low that it is
expressed as 0.0000.

62
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,940
Suggesting that it's extremely
significant.

63
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,210
And the scatter plot also reinforces this
by

64
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,940
showing a marked dependence between the 2
variables.

65
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,810
Please note that the graph in the upper
right corner gives you

66
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,780
the same R-value, P-value.

67
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:30,350
And graph as the figure shown in unit 8,
slide 12.

68
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,490
So this is one way of replicating
something that you

69
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,840
saw in the lecture slides.

70
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,000
So the second question asks us to do
another Pearson correlation

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,360
coefficient between two different
variables, math love and writing love.

72
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,370
So let's do that.

73
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,990
So the first thing I'm going to do is
close this plot.

74
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:56,460
I'm going to go to analysis correlation
again, and uncheck politics and Obama.

75
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,500
And replace that with Math Love and
Writing Love.

76
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,260
And then bring those two over, Pearson's
is great.

77
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,930
I don't need a, scatter plot this time, so
I'm going to unselect that,

78
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,000
and then I'm going to leave the options as
we had them before.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,969
I'm going to hit Run.

80
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,220
And I'm going to look at our output.

81
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,280
So the correlation coefficient in this
case is 0.1303.

82
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,630
And it has a high p-value this time,

83
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,400
meaning that it is not statistically
significant.

84
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,250
Notice that the p-value is greater than
0.05, it's 0.3936.

85
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,640
Indicating that there's no statistically
significant correlation between the two

86
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,820
variables Mathlove and WritingLove.

87
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,600
So the next question, question 3 asks us
to

88
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,630
check the normality assumption of
Pearson's correlation coefficient.

89
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,230
So it's asking us to check the normality
for the variables that we've used so

90
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,410
far in this exercise, Mathlove,
WritingLove, politics and Obama.

91
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,630
The easiest way to do that is to plot
these variables and

92
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,400
to look at the distribution to see if
they're approximately normal or not.

93
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,380
The way I'm going to do this is to go to
plots and select plot builder.

94
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,010
And I'm going to bring down Histogram.

95
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,310
And I'm just going to look at each
variable one by one, and

96
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,660
to comment on the distribution.

97
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,400
So Obama looks okay.

98
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,538
It looks skewed on the left hand side
here.

99
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:31,880
On, so that's something to keep in mind.

100
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,228
Then looking at politics.

101
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:41,500
Politics looks a little bit bi-modal.

102
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,960
With a peak here around 40.

103
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,280
And another peak here around 80.

104
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,810
So, I'm less excited about politics here.

105
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,390
Math love, let's see what that looks like.

106
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,840
Math love I think looks okay.

107
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,410
It looks the most normal out of the two,

108
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,245
all the variables that we've looked at so
far.

109
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:04,527
And then finally, let's look at writing
level.

110
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,550
And again, writing level looks a little
bimodal,

111
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,830
with a peak around 20, and another peak
around 70 or so.

112
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,915
So, I don't think that we violated the
normality assumption egregiously,

113
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:21,570
but there could be an argument made that a
different test or

114
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,970
a different kind of correlation
coefficient could be used.

115
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:33,510
Based upon the fact that our variables
aren't exactly normally distributed.

116
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,180
Question four asks us to perform a linear
regression of President Obama's approval

117
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,785
scores versus student's impression of the
new healthcare reform law.

118
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:46,950
What are the values, for the beta and the
intercept; are they

119
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,560
statistically significant; what's the
value of R squared.

120
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,370
So a lot packed into this question, but

121
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,745
very little that we need to do in R to
answer them.

122
00:07:55,745 --> 00:08:02,940
And so what I'm going to do is first exit
out of Plot Builder and

123
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,860
I'm going to go to Analysis Linear model.

124
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,630
That's going to give us the linear
regression.

125
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:14,900
The outcome that we want to look at here
is President Obama's

126
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,130
approval rating and so we're going to
select that as the outcome.

127
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:25,059
The numeric variable that we're interested
in is health care and

128
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:26,870
I can, going to, I can hit continue now.

129
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,335
We're not interested in effect
modification or

130
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:33,995
interactions of any kind, so I'm going to
skip this screen as well.

131
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:38,710
And linear regression output comes in its
own special screen,

132
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,100
it's not in the console window.

133
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,910
We're going to scroll down to look at what
I'm interested in, which are the values.

134
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,630
For the coefficients, the estimates for
the coefficients.

135
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,040
And we see that the intercept is about
55.25.

136
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,678
The beta is 0.3182.

137
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:58,654
Both are statistically significant.

138
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:05,372
And the r-squared value a little bit below
that next to Multiple R-squared,

139
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:10,826
here Is 0.15 with an F statistic of
approximately 8.2.

140
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:15,980
Question 4 asks us to perform a linear
regression of President Obama's approval

141
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,380
scores versus students' impression of the
new healthcare reform law.

142
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,700
It asks us what the values for the beta
and

143
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,800
the intercept are, as well as whether they
are statistically significant.

144
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,640
And the values of the r squared for the
linear regression as well.

145
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,300
So that's a lot packed into one question,
but

146
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,320
it's actually very little that we have to
do in deducer to get that output.

147
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,830
So the first thing we want to do is run a
linear regression, so

148
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,540
I'm going to go to Analysis and select
Linear Model in order to do that.

149
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,390
The outcome variable that we want here is
Obama.

150
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:58,050
Which represents President Obama's
approval ratings in this cohort.

151
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,360
And I want the independent variable to be

152
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,690
the attitudes towards his healthcare
reform law.

153
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,360
So I'm going to drag that over to the as
numeric box.

154
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,500
And then I'm going to click continue.

155
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,220
And then because I'm not interested in
interaction or

156
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,970
effect [/g] modification I'm going to
continue.

157
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,845
And, here we have our linear aggression
output.

158
00:10:19,845 --> 00:10:22,660
Notice it's not in the console window.

159
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,260
It's in it's own window.

160
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,346
In order to get at what I'm interested in
I'm going to scroll down.

161
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:33,410
And here I see, the different coefficient
estimates.

162
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,670
So the intercept is about 55.25.

163
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,820
The beta estimate for health care is .32,
and they both

164
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,380
have a p value of less than .05, meaning
that they're statistically significant.

165
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,590
But what does that really mean?

166
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,322
So that really means that health care is

167
00:10:50,322 --> 00:10:54,296
associated with President Obama's approval
ratings in this, in this cohort, and for

168
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:57,750
every one unit that President Obama's
approval ratings increase,

169
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,320
the attitude for healthcare, the unit for
healthcare, goes up by 0.31.

170
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,840
So that's what that's really saying.

171
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:11,431
The r squared value, which is listed

172
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:20,680
a little bit below that, Is 0.1542,

173
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,596
and the f statistic is listed as 8.2,
which is significant.

174
00:11:25,596 --> 00:11:29,732
The next question asks us to do something
similar, but

175
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:33,210
add in one more variable into the
regression.

176
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:38,555
And one reason we might do this is if we
think that the relationship between,

177
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:43,130
someone's attitude towards the healthcare
reform law,

178
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,560
may be confounded by something.

179
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,988
So, maybe it's not a real association, and
then.

180
00:11:47,988 --> 00:11:49,620
Of that association, or

181
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:56,300
rather that that observed association is
driven in fact by some other variable.

182
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,540
So, to do this, first I'm going to exit
out of this.

183
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:05,000
The question asks us to include the new
variable politics.

184
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,850
Essentially, the student's political bent.

185
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,840
And repeat what we just did.

186
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,620
So, I'm going to go to Analysis and Linear
Model.

187
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,610
I'm going to drag Obama into the Outcome
box,

188
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,880
and the healthcare variable into the As
Numeric box.

189
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,755
But also politics into the As Numeric box.

190
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:26,490
I'm going to click Continue.

191
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,840
And again, we're not interested in
interaction or

192
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,730
effect modifications, I'm just going to
continue here.

193
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,340
And our output is displayed in this screen
once again.

194
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,990
So, scrolling down, a few things to notice
here.

195
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,680
So let's, I'm going to read out the
estimates of the estimate, estimate for

196
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,930
the intercept is Is 22.2.

197
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:48,540
For healthcare is 0.13 and for politics is
0.62.

198
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,850
What should be noted as different from
before first of all

199
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,930
is the magnitude of the intercept for
healthcare.

200
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,982
In the previous regression the beta was
0.31 or 0.32.

201
00:13:00,982 --> 00:13:03,610
Rather, in this one it's 0.13, so

202
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,770
it's greatly reduced, and second, it's no
longer statistically significant.

203
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,760
So what does that really mean?

204
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,320
It means that the observed association
between

205
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,260
someone's attitude towards the health care
law and

206
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,190
President Obama was actually driven by
their political beliefs.

207
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,146
Politics here has a beta estimate of 0.62
and

208
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:29,710
the p-value is statistically significant.

209
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:34,610
So another way of interpreting that or
thinking about that is really that.

210
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:41,870
The student's political beliefs
represented by the variable politics stat,

211
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,222
is statistically significantly associated
with their views on Obama.

212
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:51,102
One other way, again, of saying that is
that.

213
00:13:51,102 --> 00:13:59,180
Their political beliefs can accurately
relate to, correlate with,

214
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:05,265
are associated with, predict, Their
attitudes towards Obama.

215
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:07,060
Okay?

216
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,995
And to just finish this up the R squared
value again you see at the bottom is about

217
00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:21,480
0.63 and the F statistic is still
significant at 36.53.

218
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,350
One other thing to keep in mind compared
to the previous

219
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:30,890
regression is that the beta estimate for
healthcare changed more than 10%.

220
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:35,550
So when this changes more than 10% this
suggests.

221
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,935
That there was confounding.

222
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:39,780
OK.

223
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,270
This isn't a very, this isn't a hard rule.

224
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:48,670
It's not like there's some mathematical
theory behind that,

225
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:55,132
but it's more of a rule of thumb that when
the beta estimate changes by more than 10%

226
00:14:55,132 --> 00:15:01,530
after adding in another variable, that
that observed relationship

227
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:07,980
Previously was due to a confounding
factor.

228
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,210
The last question in this data set, asks
us to do another linear regression.

229
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,770
But this time instead of using a
continuous variable as our

230
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,110
independent predictor, we're going to use
A categorical variable.

231
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:24,228
That variable in this case is varsity,
which happens to be binary,

232
00:15:24,228 --> 00:15:29,200
0 or 1, but that's still two categories,
and we're going to be using dummy coding,

233
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,180
to run this regression.

234
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,100
Which is a bit of a departure from what
we've been doing before with our

235
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,070
continuous independent predictors.

236
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,140
So the first step as before, is to click
on Analysis and

237
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,590
select Linear model for our regression.

238
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,310
The dependent variable we want in this
case is exercise, so

239
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,510
I'm going to move that into the outcome
box,

240
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,450
then I'm going to move varsity into the as
factor box.

241
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,460
Now, before we were moving everything into
the As Numeric box, that was for

242
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,550
continuous variables.

243
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,090
When we want to treat something as a
factor, or as a categorical variable,

244
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:08,540
we're going to move that variable into the
box labeled as Factor.

245
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,970
OK, and then I'm going to click Continue.

246
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,920
We're not interested in effect
modification interaction at this point so

247
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,440
I'm just going to click continue and
scroll down to look at our results.

248
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,160
So a few things here.

249
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,550
So the beta estimate for our intercepts is
3.57.

250
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,910
The beta estimate for the variable varsity
is 0.975.

251
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:32,426
The r squared is 0.03 and the f statistic
is 1.5.

252
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:35,200
The s statistic is not significant.

253
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,160
Probably the most thing in this output is
the p-value.

254
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,710
And the row for the varsity variable.

255
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,620
It's 0.227.

256
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,520
It's not statistically significant.

257
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,668
Which means that our conclusion is that
varsity is not

258
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:57,350
statistically significantly associated
With,

259
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,810
the amount of exercise that you, have
right now.

260
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:06,390
So that concludes, this third exercise
and,

261
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:14,986
this third R video module.
