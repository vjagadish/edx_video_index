1
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,873
[BLANK_AUDIO].

2
00:00:07,873 --> 00:00:12,484
Already we've talked about the phrase root
cause analysis.

3
00:00:12,484 --> 00:00:17,913
And many of you have probably heard the
phrase thrown out and never really

4
00:00:17,913 --> 00:00:24,210
understood what it really meant or what
the intent of a root cause analysis.

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,070
So looking at this graphic, the symptom of
the problem is the weed.

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,760
It is above the surface.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,850
It's obvious.

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,060
It's visible, and it's very, very clear.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:42,310
The underlying causes, the root, is below
the surface, not obvious.

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,268
And we all know that if you trim the weed
without getting to the root, it's a good

11
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:51,350
likelihood that you're going to have that
weed come back up again.

12
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,232
So the word root in root cause analysis
generally refers to

13
00:00:57,232 --> 00:01:02,500
the underlying causes, not just the one
apparent cause.

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,900
And that is a tendency of folks who
conduct root

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,320
cause analysis indicating that hey, we
found what the single problem is.

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,270
We fixed that single problem.

17
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,300
And then three weeks, three months later
the same event occurs.

18
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,858
So we're going to take you through a
little bit more in-depth of

19
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:25,638
what the expectations of a root cause
analysis is, so

20
00:01:25,638 --> 00:01:29,670
that way you can help understand the
process and help your

21
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,450
organization prevent from having one of
these bad type of patient care events.

22
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:43,718
The goals of the root cause analysis is to
identify what those root causes are and

23
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:45,710
contributing factors.

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,494
Contributing factors are, may not be
directly responsible for

25
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:56,597
contributing to the outcome that occurred
with your patient, but it may be

26
00:01:56,597 --> 00:02:02,000
something that kind of assisted the
process along to lead to a system failure.

27
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,400
Another goal is to focus on the structure,
systems and process variations.

28
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,900
We are going to go through some of the
techniques and tools that are used to

29
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,239
unveil or uncover what some of those root
causes are and the contributing factors.

30
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,410
And the third bullet, the goal is not to
focus on individual staff or

31
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,050
physician performance.

32
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,290
This is really the role of the
organization peer review or

33
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,540
human resource process.

34
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,290
So we try to take out the, blame the
individual but

35
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:45,810
look at more of what's the system process
issue that led to the adverse outcome?

36
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,210
So when you actually look at the goals of
the root cause analysis or

37
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:56,150
RCA, you kind of have to look at, what are
the questions we need to ask?

38
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,780
What happened?

39
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,365
Did it actually lead to a bad patient care
event?

40
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:05,665
Or was it a close call that if it followed
this progression it

41
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:09,640
could have lead to an adverse patient care
situation.

42
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,080
Some of the questions regarding what
happened is that what happened that day?

43
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,716
What usually happens, what normally
standard practice is and then what

44
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:24,860
should have happened, which typically is
outlined in policy and procedures.

45
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,770
We all know that the event itself led to a
bad outcome is not something we

46
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,130
expect everyone to have every single day.

47
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:38,094
I mean, how many people in healthcare
comes to work thinking I'm going to go

48
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:41,700
out and kill a patient or, you know, do
some damage.

49
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,214
You know, I mean that should be the
significant variation [LAUGH] and

50
00:03:46,214 --> 00:03:48,804
it really should be thinking about well,

51
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:53,614
the standard norm in terms of what we do
or the tolerance that we have in terms of

52
00:03:53,614 --> 00:03:59,016
variation from our policy is it something
that's actually acceptable and what really

53
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:04,258
should have happened is what's typically
outlined in policies and procedures.

54
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:08,476
Another question, and we'll get into this
much further in terms of

55
00:04:08,476 --> 00:04:11,530
the drill down is, why did it actually
happen?

56
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,716
You know, you've heard about the five
why's, we're going to

57
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:18,610
talk a little bit more about that later
when we get into more of the details, but

58
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,120
you have to ask the question, why did it
happen?

59
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,040
Another question, what are we going to do
to prevent it from happening again?

60
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,822
What are the actions or system process
changes, and

61
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:35,399
what kind of outcomes can we tolerate in
our organization so

62
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:40,459
that we make sure that we don't have to
have these kind of events happening again?

63
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:44,409
How will we know that our actions improve
patient safety and

64
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:49,465
that's the need, as part of the plan do
check act process is like checking to

65
00:04:49,465 --> 00:04:54,442
make sure that we're heading in the right
direction, that our outcomes,

66
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:59,850
the metrics that we're setting as
expectation are being met.

67
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,475
And, if they're not being met, we may have
to go back and

68
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:07,000
re-review what we had done to make sure
that we have actually identified the right

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,610
root causes, contributing factors, and
make those appropriate adjustments.

70
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,840
The what.

71
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,230
Process for identifying contributing or
causal factors that underlie

72
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:25,590
variations in performance associated with
adverse event or close calls.

73
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:31,005
So really it comes down to the done
obedience concept of quality that

74
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:37,085
if your structure is put together well,
that you have good system process,

75
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:41,680
the outcome should be very consistent or
very reliable.

76
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,544
Any time there's a change in process,
there is usually a ramification of action.

77
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:50,514
And so that's where we tend to focus on,
is looking at those system process issues,

78
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:53,524
knowing that the structure typically, you
know,

79
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:57,610
has been outlined in a particular way to
have a particular outcome.

80
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,813
The what question also features
interdisciplinary involvement of

81
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:06,940
those closest to and, or most knowledgable
about the situation.

82
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,174
You remember I said that in high
reliability organizations there's

83
00:06:11,174 --> 00:06:16,070
a deference to expertise and there's a
sensitivity to operation.

84
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,969
You need both of those many times to drill
down to figure out what actually happened,

85
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:24,971
what was the process modification or what
was the practice in order to

86
00:06:24,971 --> 00:06:28,130
understand what we need to do to correct
the problem.

87
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:35,725
The root cause analysis can also be used
for either a single significant event or

88
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:40,880
it could be used for a group or set of
similar occurrence.

89
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,520
Or if you're like many organizations they
track and trend their data.

90
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,240
There are some adverse trend and less
significant occurrence, you can

91
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,332
certainly apply the root cause analysis
technique to drill down and figure out

92
00:06:52,332 --> 00:06:56,290
what do we need to do to change things to
meet our performance expectation.

93
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,930
Realistically, what we must change or put
in place to prevent this from

94
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,480
happening again is really the core
fundamental goal of a root cause analysis.

95
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,310
And this particular slide actually is a
good graphic to

96
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,082
show you what is not and what is a root
cause analysis.

97
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:20,718
It's not about people making mistakes.

98
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:25,550
It's not about affixing blame or
disciplining those involved.

99
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,901
It's not about the history.

100
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:31,573
It's not justifying what happened as
expected, acceptable or

101
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:34,225
inevitable but it is about improving
system,

102
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:39,053
preventing recurrence, understanding what
we need to do to change the system, and

103
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:43,494
ultimately a way to improve patient care,
specifically patient safety.

104
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:48,830
Some of the components of an effective
root cause analysis include,

105
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,690
recreating the event.

106
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,860
This may require interviews or statements
from witnesses, a review of

107
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:02,040
the medical records, a review of the
physical site where the event occurred.

108
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,428
[BLANK_AUDIO].

109
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:04,668
A review of personnel or

110
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:08,389
medical staff files, internal documents,
policy and procedures.

111
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,180
There is a need to actually map out a
timeline.

112
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,564
Until you actually map out the sequencing
of an event and

113
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:20,524
I know that, you know, there's often times
disputes about when

114
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:23,780
a particular thing happened at a
particular point.

115
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,890
But nevertheless, putting it on a piece of
paper, or putting it on a flip chart, or

116
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:33,640
a diagram, PowerPoint slide can help
recreate what had actually occurred.

117
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,576
There's a need to do some maybe,

118
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:42,400
potentially some process mapping because,
as we mentioned, this is the next size of

119
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,690
evaluation of the process of what it takes
to figure out what had happened.

120
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,710
So process mapping is a technique and tool
that we often use to try to drill down to

121
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,430
figure out, well, what are the steps
involved in a particular process so

122
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,057
that we could figure out where the
variations are.

123
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,220
Fishbone diagram, or

124
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,290
the Ishikawa diagram, is a great tool to
be able to drill down further to

125
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:10,139
figure out what really are root causes,
and what may be just contributing factors.

126
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,199
Since nowadays, more and more
organizations are publishing their

127
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:20,554
learning and findings from their
experience, research of literature and or

128
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:25,110
professional organization is real helpful
to be able to understand what might be

129
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,740
lessons learned from other organizations.

130
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,378
And then, ultimately,

131
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:34,994
the presentation of the findings to senior
leadership and/or the governing board,

132
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:40,240
which is something the joint commission
requires for accredited hospitals.

133
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,348
But for most organizations, by sharing it
with leaderships and

134
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:48,224
governing board, you know, certainly
governing board has a vested interest in

135
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:51,060
what's going on within the organization.

136
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,350
And, of course, from a professional
standpoint, reputation standpoint,

137
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,445
you know, health plan standpoint,
organizations governing board often

138
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:02,760
times would like to know what kind of
things are happening and

139
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,710
what are we going to do to prevent them
from happening again.

140
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,610
The scope of that whole focus, you know,

141
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,570
really does fall on senior leadership and
the governing board.

142
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,569
