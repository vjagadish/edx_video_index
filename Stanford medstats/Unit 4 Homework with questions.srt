1
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,528
In the case of a discrete probability
distribution, the formula for

2
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:13,720
the expected value is [SOUND] x times P of
x.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:21,030
So, we can just make a new column here
which is x times P of x.

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:28,850
We get 0.1, 0.4, 1.2, 0.4, and 1.

5
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,620
And if we add all these numbers together,
we get the mean as 3.1.

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,339
In the previous question, we found that
the mean for

7
00:00:37,339 --> 00:00:42,222
this distribution was 3.1.

8
00:00:42,222 --> 00:00:43,776
We will be applying the standard formula
for

9
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,770
the standard distrubtion here which is.

10
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,026
I'm just going to write out the first
couple of

11
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:58,128
expressions to help you understand how
this is calculated.

12
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:07,153
So for x of 0 we have 0 minus 3.1 times
the probablity of x of 0 which is 0.

13
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:09,625
Plus for x of 1, 1 minus 3.1 and

14
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:17,000
the probability of getting of x of one
which is 0.1 and so on.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,173
We have corresponding terms for 2,3,4 and
5 and

16
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:27,058
if we do the math the answer comes out to
be 1.22 We are given a normal

17
00:01:27,058 --> 00:01:32,515
distribution with a mean of 1 gram per
centimeter squared and

18
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:42,502
a standard deviation of 0.1 gram per
centimeter squared.

19
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:46,700
And the question wants us to find.

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:55,724
The area total left of .85 gram per
centimeter square.

21
00:01:55,724 --> 00:02:02,312
Now this corresponds to a z value of which
is [SOUND] and if we look

22
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:11,950
out the probability Cause it's pointing to
z value of minus 1.5.

23
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,580
You see that a probability is 0.0668.

24
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,585
One thing to note here is that we should
be referring to the one tail z values and

25
00:02:18,585 --> 00:02:21,434
not the 2 tail z values because we only
want to

26
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:29,410
find the probability That this we have
values which are less than .85.

27
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,643
We don't want to find the probability that
we have values greater than one

28
00:02:32,643 --> 00:02:35,190
standard deviation about the mean.

29
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,278
In the previous question, we found the
area of the curve to the left.

30
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:43,420
Of .81, .85.

31
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,370
This question wants us to find the area to
the right of 1.15.

32
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,722
We could argue that because the normal
distribution is symmetric,

33
00:02:49,722 --> 00:02:52,494
the area that we found in the previous
question would be exactly the area that we

34
00:02:52,494 --> 00:02:55,110
would find in this question as well.

35
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,475
But let us just go through the numbers.

36
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:58,370
To confirm that that is the case.

37
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,402
In this case, the z value is [SOUND] and

38
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:07,946
if we look up the probability
distribution, [SOUND]

39
00:03:07,946 --> 00:03:17,415
we'll see that the p value corresponding
to this Is 0.0668.

40
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:21,770
Which is exactly the same value that we
found in the previous question as well.

41
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,850
This question is a straight-forward
application of

42
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,340
the binomial equation again.

43
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,950
We have n equals 5.

44
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,610
We are given that b is 0.513.

45
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:39,915
And we want to find the probability Of x
being 4.

46
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:45,525
And this, recalling the expression that

47
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:52,858
we had for the binomial distribution.

48
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:56,134
And if we do the math here,

49
00:03:56,134 --> 00:04:02,920
we'll find that the answer is 16.9%.

50
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,210
So there is a 16.9% chance that out of the
next 5 births exactly 4 are boys.

51
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:12,635
Question 6 has approximately normal
distribution with a mean of 80 and

52
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:15,650
a standard deviation of 10.

53
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,660
We need to find.

54
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:23,558
The value of x such that we have 25
percent of

55
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:29,070
the normal distribution area to the right
of x.

56
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,913
So the first step here would be to find
the z square corresponding to 25% in

57
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:35,685
the right tail and we can look this up in
our z table and

58
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:41,946
we'll see that the z squared that we would
be looking for is 0.674.

59
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:46,434
Now, it's a simple job of plugging this
into the formula for z,

60
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:52,090
we know that z is x minus mu by standard
deviation.

61
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,863
We can flip this around make x the subject
of the formula and

62
00:04:55,863 --> 00:05:00,740
say that x is z times standard deviation
plus mu.

63
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:09,130
Which comes out to be 86.74.

64
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,730
That's to ensure an A in this class.

65
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,748
We need to get a score of at least 86.74.

66
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:19,420
This question has a doctor who performs 8
operations a day the probability of

67
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,169
success of any one operation is 95%.

68
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:27,987
We want to find the probability that a
doctor has exactly two failed operations

69
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:34,992
on a particular day directly applying the
binomial formula to this question.

70
00:05:34,992 --> 00:05:39,516
We have 0.95 raised to 6 because we have
six successful operations and

71
00:05:39,516 --> 00:05:45,510
0.25 raised to the 2 corresponding to the
two failed relations.

72
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,900
And we see that the probability is 5.1%.

73
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,160
This question has the same doctor as the
previous question.

74
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,680
He still performs eight operations in a
day.

75
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,000
The probability of success of any one
operation is still 95%.

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,597
Now we want to calculate the probability
that a doctor has two or

77
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,419
more failed operations on a given day.

78
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,187
There are two ways of solving this
question.

79
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:15,910
We could either find the probability that
the doctor has two or three.

80
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,307
Or 4 or 5 or 6 7 or 8 fill operations on a
given day.

81
00:06:19,307 --> 00:06:23,402
Or we could just find the probability that
the doctor has no fill operations or

82
00:06:23,402 --> 00:06:26,552
1 fill operations on a day, add them up,
subtract them from 1,

83
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:32,184
that should give us the same answer that
we're looking for.

84
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,664
And because the second method actually has
us adding up only two terms of

85
00:06:35,664 --> 00:06:40,970
the binomial distribution, it's actually
much simpler to calculate than.

86
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,740
The fourth method here.

87
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,440
So, that is the one we'll be using.

88
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,914
The probability of having no field
operations

89
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:54,894
on a given day is, the probability of

90
00:06:54,894 --> 00:07:00,610
having one operations on a given day is,

91
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,680
[NOISE] And if we just add these two
terms, and

92
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,992
subtract them out from 1, the answer we

93
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:20,790
get is 5.7%.

94
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,000
We can model this game using the
following.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,450
We have two outcomes for this game.

96
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,580
Either we win the game, or we lose the
game.

97
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,440
If we win the game, we get the payoff of
$1 million, and

98
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,240
if we lose the game, we get a payoff of
zero.

99
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,884
But either way, we have to pay $50 to play
the game, so

100
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:43,852
the total payoff in case we win is $1
million minus 50 and

101
00:07:43,852 --> 00:07:51,235
the pay off, if we lose is negative $50.

102
00:07:51,235 --> 00:07:54,322
Let's say the probability associated with
winning is b and

103
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:58,428
the probability associated with losing is
one minus b.

104
00:07:58,428 --> 00:08:00,320
Let's find out.

105
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,640
What the value of p is.

106
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,396
The probability of winning is the
probability of

107
00:08:06,396 --> 00:08:11,450
getting either three or four sixes.

108
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:17,509
Now, we can model each of these two
expressions using the binomial equation.

109
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:21,488
In this case, the binomial is the fact
that we have four die.

110
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:26,272
N is 4, and the probability of getting a 6
on any one die is

111
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:30,432
one sixth because this is an unbiased die,
so we,

112
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:40,375
the probability of getting three 6s as by
6 to the third and 5 by 6th.

113
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:49,940
Probably you are getting four 6s.

114
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,740
This gives us the total probability of
varying as 0.0162.

115
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:59,620
Now we can use the value of P that we
found, which was 0.0162,

116
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:06,200
To find the expected value of this game.

117
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,256
You know that point b is 0.0162.

118
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,670
1 minus b is 0.0.

119
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:16,970
Okay it's actually 0.9838.

120
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,020
The expected value of this Is,

121
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,858
can be found using the expression that we
have for the expected value of

122
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:30,600
a discrete distribution which is summation
of x times p of x.

123
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:38,298
Again the [UNKNOWN] is $1 million.

124
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:42,010
Minus the 50 that we paid to play.

125
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,360
And the probability of us winning 0.0162.

126
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,230
And the payoff if we lose is a negative
$50.

127
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,260
And the probability of us losing, which is
0.9838.

128
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,804
And if we do the math, we'll see that the
probability, the expected value for

129
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:04,570
the game comes to about $16,000.

130
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,980
Which tells us that the, the expected
value is positive.

131
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,236
Question 10 has a binomial distribution
but

132
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:15,400
we are told that we can use a normal
approximation.

133
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,336
Before we go on to the normal
approximation, though,

134
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:19,640
let's just find quickly the expected
value.

135
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,770
And the standard deviation for the
binomial distribution.

136
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,980
The expected value is n times p,

137
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:33,100
n in our case is 200, and p is 0.5, which
gives us an expected value of 100.

138
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:41,491
The standard deviation is n times p time 1
minus p, which comes out to 7.07.

139
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,390
Let's now go to the normality
approximation.

140
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:54,540
We have a mean of 100 and a standard
deviation of 7.07.

141
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,640
We want to find the probability that A
number chosen from

142
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,244
the distribution turns out to be greater
than 112,

143
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:05,680
which is just equivalent to finding the
area to the right of 112.

144
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,470
Let's just find a z-score corresponding to
112 before we go on.

145
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,360
We know that the value of Z is given by x
minus m by standard deviation.

146
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:21,104
This comes out

147
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:26,769
to 1.7.

148
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:32,313
And that's the probability of choosing a
number from this distribution and

149
00:11:32,313 --> 00:11:36,889
finding And that number to be greater than
112, [INAUDIBLE] of

150
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:45,050
having a probability of Z being 1.7 or
more, which comes out to 4.45%.

151
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,490
In this question, we are considering a
variable called Wake-up time, and

152
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,923
we have 24 observations for this variable.

153
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:52,039
We have the histogram, the normal
probability plot and

154
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,787
the results of a formal test of normality,
and

155
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:57,648
we need to decide whether this variable is
normally distributed.

156
00:11:57,648 --> 00:11:59,624
Now, the histogram is approximately
normal,

157
00:11:59,624 --> 00:12:01,830
even though it isn't exactly normal.

158
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:07,503
The normal probability plot is more or
less a straight line, and the value

159
00:12:07,503 --> 00:12:16,260
of p that we get from the formal test of
normality is 0.25, which is quite high.

160
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,560
All three point to the fact that we can
treat this variable as

161
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,145
approximately normal, even though we know
that it isn't exactly normal.
