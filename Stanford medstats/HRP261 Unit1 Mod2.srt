1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,480
In this next module, I'm going to talk
more about the odds ratio.

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,450
So I'm going to tell you how you get a p
value and

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,730
a confidence interval from a simple two by
two table odds ratio.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,650
And I think that's useful to know.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,560
Because in fact understanding the shape of
the distribution of an odds ratio as

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,060
well as the standard error, will give you
some insight into the measure itself.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,750
And I'm also going to tell you a little
bit more about this problem of

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,540
interpreting odds ratios correctly.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,660
So, first of all you may be asking
yourself why do we ever even use odds

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,090
ratios when they're so confusing and
there's actually two reasons for.

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,940
So one reason is that when you do a case
control study you go out and

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,080
you sample people based on whether or not
they already have a disease.

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,605
So you may go out and sample 50% of your
sample may be cases and

14
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:54,190
50% of your sample may be controls.

15
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,180
When you sample on disease status you can
no longer validly estimate things like

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,740
the risk of the disease or the prevalence
of the disease.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,580
Therefore, you cannot estimate risk ratios
or rate ratios.

18
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,500
It turns out that with a case-control
study,

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,280
the only valid measure of relative risk is
the odds ratio.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,250
The odds ratio can therefore be applied in
the case control study, and

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,510
since it's the only relative risk that
works, we use it there.

22
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,820
A more important reason that odds ratios
come up so

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,020
much, however, is just simply the fact
that even when we're not

24
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,320
dealing with a case control study, a lot
of times when you have covert studies.

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,850
Or even randomized trials, as we saw in
the last modules, or

26
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,675
cross sectional studies, a lot of authors
will choose to use logistic regression

27
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:44,200
because it's the most commonly used
regression method for a binary outcome.

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,650
When you run a logistic regression it
gives you odds ratios, not risk ratios.

29
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,520
So you're just kind of stuck with odds
ratios and

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,320
you have to be very careful about what you
do with those and how you report those.

31
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,730
this class is largely about logistic
regressions.

32
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,820
Not surprisingly, we're going to see awful
lot of odds ratios in this class.

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,810
So I just want to quickly review,

34
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,870
how do you calculate an odds ratio from a
simple two by two table.

35
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,860
That's what we're going to be talking
about in this module.

36
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,830
So if you have a two by two table, you can
say well, you have, you either are exposed

37
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,850
or not, and you have the outcome or not,
any two binary variable will work there.

38
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,030
By convention, we sometimes call the cells
of the two by two table a, b, c and d.

39
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,530
And to calculate an odds ratio, it's very
simple.

40
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,650
So, if you're looking at some kind of
exposure and you want to know,

41
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,820
what's the odds of getting the outcome in
the exposed group?

42
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,680
You just look at cells a and b.

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,380
So the odds is going to be your chance of
getting it

44
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,790
divided by your chance of not getting it.

45
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,340
So that's a divided by b.

46
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,040
That's the odds of getting the outcome in
the exposed group.

47
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,930
The odds of getting the outcome in the
unexposed group therefore will be

48
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,330
c divided by d.

49
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,360
So it's an odds ratio, so we divide those
two odds.

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,410
Mathematically however it's even simpler
to calculate than this.

51
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,420
Because if you multiply by the reciprocal
here you realize that

52
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,700
to calculate the odds ratio, from a two by
two table, all you have to do,

53
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,270
is do a times d, divided by b times c, so
just use those cross products.

54
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,560
Very straight forward to calculate.

55
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,640
Now, I'll just note, that if you're doing
a case-control study, it's a little bit

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,870
different, but mathematically, it ends up
being exactly the same.

57
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,380
So in a case-control study, it's not valid
to say what your chances of, or

58
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,010
your odds of being a case versus a control
in the exposed group because remember,

59
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,520
we've sampled on case-control status.

60
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,960
However, it is valid to say if you're a
case, what are your odds of being exposed?

61
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,910
That's a divided by c.

62
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,040
So we can calculate the odds ratio, the
odds of exposure in

63
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,440
the case group versus the odds of exposure
in the control group.

64
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,690
But notice that mathematically that turns
out to be exactly the same thing: it's

65
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,480
still just a cross-product, a times d,
divided by b times c.

66
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,250
And it turns out that this odds ratio, the
odds of.

67
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,650
Being exposed in the case version of the
control group is mathematically equivalent

68
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,420
to the odds of getting the disease in the
exposed group versus the unexposed group.

69
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,360
Since those are mathematically equivalent,

70
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,220
that's why this is the only valid measure
of relative risk for a case-control study.

71
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,730
But again, its calculation is very simple.

72
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,970
Just a times d over b times c.

73
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,320
Now, what is the distribution of an odds
ratio?

74
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,830
That is, if you were to go out and repeat
your study over and over again

75
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:26,700
under multiple samples, what would the
distribution of the odds ratio look like?

76
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,370
This is what we always need to know,
fundamentally about a statistic.

77
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,420
What is its distribution?

78
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,880
What's the shape of the distribution,
what's its mean?

79
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,780
And what's the standard error?

80
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,220
To answer this question you could go look
up the formula for

81
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,090
this and I'll give you the formula in a
minute.

82
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,760
But I always think it's nice to illustrate
the distribution of

83
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,360
a statistic by doing a simulation.

84
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,818
I think simulations are fun and they kind
of, interesting things pop up.

85
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:50,130
So we're going to look at doing a
simulation for

86
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,830
the distribution of an odds ratio.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,540
So how do I actually do this in the
computer,

88
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,980
I'll just give you a brief summary of how
I did this on the computer.

89
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,620
So what I'm essentially doing is I'm
saying imagine that I just got a large or,

90
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,140
you know, it can be infinite on a
computer, large population of cases and

91
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,490
a large population of controls.

92
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,190
And for the purposes of this simulation,

93
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,790
I'm going to start by assuming that the
null hypothesis is true.

94
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,420
So that my exposure, which in this case is
smoking, is unrelated to whether or

95
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,000
not you're a case or a control.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,970
And I can set that by just saying imagine
that 20% of the case

97
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,010
population are smokers, and 20% of the
control population are smokers.

98
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,210
Now imagine that I do a virtual case
control study.

99
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,350
I tell my computer to randomly select 50
people from the cases and 50 people from

100
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,620
the controls and then to tell me how many
smokers popped up in each group.

101
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,790
Every person has a 20% chance of being a
smoker in both the case group and

102
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,890
the control group.

103
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,700
But, because of random chance,

104
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,660
it's not like I'm going to get exactly ten
smokers in the case group.

105
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,320
I might end up with 10 smokers that's the
most likely outcome but

106
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,216
I can also get 11, 12, 13, 14, nine,
eight, seven.

107
00:05:58,216 --> 00:06:02,560
I'm going to get around 20% smokers in the
case group but

108
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,030
with a sample of only 50 which is pretty
small.

109
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,340
I could easily end up with say 15 smokers
in the case group.

110
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:09,970
And then my, and

111
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,550
then the, the risk of being a smoker in
the case group would actually be 30%.

112
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,020
So I'm not going to always get 20% in
those two groups.

113
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,280
And what I'm essentially doing in my
simulation.

114
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Is I'm just telling my computer to pick
things randomly from

115
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,910
a binomial distribution.

116
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,640
With an n of 50 and a p of 0.2 and

117
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,740
that will get me the counts for cases and
smokers and controls in smokers.

118
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,280
So when I get those counts for

119
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,510
a single virtual case control study, I can
just drop them in a two by two table.

120
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,110
How many, you know, in one iteration, one
virtual.

121
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,760
Case control study here, maybe, you know,
here's case control, and

122
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,510
maybe what I end up with is smokers, not
smokers.

123
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,340
And maybe I end up in this case with 12
cases who happen to be smokers, and

124
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,110
therefore 38 who aren't, and maybe I end
up with.

125
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,960
Eight controls who are smokers and 42 who
aren't.

126
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,080
And that's just random chance.

127
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,880
Remember, there's really no relationship
between being a case and

128
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,070
smoking, in this case.

129
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:15,928
But when I calculate the odds ratio, I'll
get 12 times 42 divided by 8 times 38.

130
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:18,390
It's not going to be exactly one, it's
going to be a little bit greater than one.

131
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,660
So I'm going to calculate that observ,

132
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,560
observed odds ratio, I'm going to save it
and here is the key to the simulation.

133
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,400
I get my odds ratio from my one virtual
case control study and

134
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,730
then I do this over and over and over and
over again.

135
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,410
I keep sampling new samples and

136
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,080
I'm going to get slightly different odds
ratios every time.

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,950
I'm going to repeat this run arbitrarily
large number of times, say a 1,000 times.

138
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,120
Now since I did 1,000 times for this
particular simulation, I can do it 10,000,

139
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,980
I can do it 15,000.

140
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,180
I'm only limited really by, by computing
power.

141
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,530
And then I'm going to plot the
distribution of those 1,000 odds ratios.

142
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,860
So I got 1,000 odds ratios from 1,000
different virtual case control studies,

143
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,880
and I'm going to plot them in a histogram,
and

144
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,500
I can literally observe the distribution
of odds ratios.

145
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,380
So that's what I did to the computer and
here's the results.

146
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,460
Here's the simulated results from my a
thousand case-control studies.

147
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,350
Now notice, a couple of things to notice.

148
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,530
So first of all, if you look at this
distribution,

149
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,630
the mean of the distribution happens right
about one.

150
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,050
Well, you're expecting that because,
remember, we assumed that the x axis here

151
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,390
is the observed odds ratios, the the Y
axis here is the frequency.

152
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,870
This is just a histogram.

153
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,620
So again the odds ratios of 1 were most
common because we assumed here that the no

154
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,730
hypothesis was true.

155
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,470
There is no difference in smoking levels
between the case and the control group.

156
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,801
Therefore the odds ratio actually is one
and

157
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:36,180
when we do our sampling, when we, when we
are going to get.

158
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,520
Ratios around one, and you can see that
that impact happened.

159
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,130
But what's really interesting about this
distribution, is notice that it

160
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,740
did not come out as a bell curve, as a
Gaussian or normal distribution.

161
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,660
Remember that when we talked about.

162
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,080
Statistical distributions in the past,
like the distribution of a mean, or

163
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,380
the distribution of a proportion.

164
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,750
A lot of times those things just magically
happen to come out to be

165
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,160
a normal distribution, which was great.

166
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,780
It was easy to deal with.

167
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,850
The odds ratio does not come out to be a
normal distribution.

168
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,320
It comes out to be a right-skewed
distribution.

169
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,620
You can see that in the right tail here.

170
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,580
And why does this happen?

171
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,280
See, notice that you get a long right tail
here.

172
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,400
Why does this happen well, odds cannot be
negative you can't have a negative odds.

173
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,340
Therefore, an odds ratio can never be
negative so you have a left tail boundary

174
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:30,220
at zero you can't go lower then zero,
however odds ratios can get as big.

175
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,520
It theoretically can be as big as you
want.

176
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,640
There's no right hand bound here.

177
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,620
And so the odds ratio can go out and be
quite high.

178
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,280
And notice that in this case, the no
hypothesis is true, yet

179
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,360
a couple of times out of a thousand,

180
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,790
we saw odds ratios in the three, four,
five, six purely by chance.

181
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,100
Just we happened in a particular sample to
get many more smokers in

182
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,230
the case group than the control group.

183
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,920
Purely by chance.

184
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,830
So you can see an odds ratio of 6.8, even
when there's no

185
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:04,510
relationship between the exposure and the
disease in a small study like this.

186
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,510
Only happened one out of 1,000 times, but
it can happen.

187
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,600
So, we get this right skewed distribution.

188
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,250
It's hard to make inferences from a right
skewed distribution.

189
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,740
We don't want to deal with a messy
distribution like this.

190
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,850
We want to end up on a normal distribtuon
like everything else.

191
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,490
Well the good news is there's a simple
transformation that you can

192
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,660
make to make the distribution of the odds
ratio normally distributed.

193
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,630
And what's that transformation, you can
take a natural log.

194
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,210
So, why a natural log?

195
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,330
Natural log's obviously going to come up a
lot in this course, because of this.

196
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,490
The natural log, what that does, is all
the numbers,

197
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,460
remember odds ratios can occur between
zero and one.

198
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,820
You can have fractions for odds ratios.

199
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,090
All those numbers between zero and

200
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,110
one, suddenly, when you take a natural
log, those become negatives.

201
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,600
So we put all the negative numbers back
into play which now makes it

202
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,940
a much more symmetric distribution.

203
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,785
When you're dealing with a natural log of
the odds ratio the odds ratio is equal to

204
00:10:56,785 --> 00:11:01,170
1, then the natural log of the, of one is
zero.

205
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,680
So the natural log of the odds ratio will
be zero.

206
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Under the no hypothesis.

207
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,290
So notice that our graph here is centered
around zero.

208
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,420
It's a nice symmetric, normal curve.

209
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,990
What's the standard error here?

210
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,260
What's the standard error?

211
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,130
Well, we can kind of just eyeball it on
the graph and say well, gee,

212
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,900
it looks like maybe the standard error of
the natural log of the odds ratio is

213
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,510
somewhere around between five here.

214
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,410
Well there's actually a formula that
somebody's derived to tell you

215
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,910
what the standard error of, the natural
log of the odds ratio is.

216
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,550
And so, of course, we don't have to run a
simulation every time, so

217
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,620
we just like a nice formula for the
standard error, and

218
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,590
somebody's approximated that, has worked
it out.

219
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,540
And I think it's useful to actually look
at that standard error formula because it

220
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,910
gives you some insight into the odds
ratio.

221
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,470
So what is this formula?

222
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,830
So remember I told you in a two by two
table we can label the cells, a,

223
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,630
b, c and d.

224
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,889
So this a, b, c and d, that's just the
four cells from a two by two table.

225
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,390
And what's really interesting here is
notice that the standard error

226
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,070
is related to the reciprocal of those cell
sizes.

227
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,490
So what does that actually mean?

228
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,060
Well, just let's plug in some numbers.

229
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,440
What if we had a study where we ended up
with a very small cell a, you know,

230
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,470
had a 1 in it, and maybe cell b has ten,
and cell c is 100, and cell d has 1000.

231
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,370
What's that going to mean in terms of the
standard error?

232
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,826
If we plug into the standard error
formula, we notice is we get 1 over 1,

233
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:31,730
plus one over 10, plus 1 over 100, plus 1
over 1000.

234
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,585
Now, notice what that breaks down to
inside the square root.

235
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:40,380
Though cell a contributes a one to the
variability.

236
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,620
All the other cells contribute decimal
places.

237
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,970
So this just ends up being 1.111, right.

238
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,790
So everything else is just a decimal
place.

239
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,720
Cell a,

240
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,490
almost completely, the smallest cell,
almost completely drives the variability.

241
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,890
And that makes a lot of sense.

242
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,720
In terms of how much variability there is
in an odds ratio,

243
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,530
the smallest cell is really the limiting
factor.

244
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,294
Because imagine that I were, was to change
cell a by just 1%.

245
00:13:04,294 --> 00:13:08,640
Subtract 1 or add 1, that's going to have
a huge impact on the odds ratio.

246
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,030
Whereas if I were to add or subtract 1
from cell b or cell c or

247
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,520
cell d it's not going to have much a an
impact on the odds ratio so,

248
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,230
the variability of an odds ratio really is
driven.

249
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,210
By the size of the smallest cell and that
insight is kind of burred in

250
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,565
the standard error there so I think that's
neat.

251
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:28,130
Alright, so just to summarize the natural
log of the odds

252
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,360
ratio luckily is normally distributed, the
mean value is whatever the true value of

253
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,290
the natural log of the odds ratio ratio is
under the null hypothesis, that's zero.

254
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,990
And the standard error is that formula
that I just gave you.

255
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,580
We're not going to have to calculate too
many of these by hand in this class, but

256
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,460
again I think just understanding the
distribution here gives you some insight.

257
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,190
So, inferences for the odds the ratio, if
I want to do a hypothesis test.

258
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,310
I want to test whether or not the odds
ratio is one,

259
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,730
which is equivalent to the natural log of
the odds ratio being 0,

260
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,420
so that would be my null hypothesis, if
there's no difference between the groups.

261
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,590
I would just do a z test, because we're on
a normal curve.

262
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,180
I compared the natural log of the odds
ratio that I observed with its standard,

263
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,140
with its standard error.

264
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,962
Simple to calculate.

265
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:14,170
The 95% confidence interval is similarly
going to be based on the standard error.

266
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,820
Notice, though, that we're going to be
calculating the 95% confidence interval

267
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,210
for the natural log of the odds ratio by
adding and subtracting 1.96.

268
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,260
Times the standard error.

269
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,960
That will give me a confidence interval
for the natural log of the odds ratio.

270
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,600
You don't want to report that in your
paper, though,

271
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,650
because odds ratios are hard enough to
understand.

272
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,680
Don't bother with natural logs of odds
ratios, nobody can understand that.

273
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,200
So what we're going to do, of course, at
the end of the day, is take the upper and

274
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,940
lower bounds and exponentiate them to get
back to an actual odds ratio measure.

275
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,790
And that's going to have an interesting
effect, that,

276
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:52,270
if you've ever noticed odds ratios and 95%
confidence intervals in the literature,

277
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,300
a lot of people would remark, well,
they're not symmetric.

278
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,480
If you look at the confidence interval,

279
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,900
this was the confidence interval from a
previous module for an odds ratio.

280
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,700
Notice that it's not symmetric.

281
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,250
The 0.243 does not fall right in the
middle.

282
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,850
We actually end up with kind of a high
upper bound, and

283
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,800
the point estimate is closer to the left
bound.

284
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,710
Well, this is an effect of exponentiating,
of dealing with logs.

285
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,680
So sometimes in the literature,

286
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,670
you'll see that the upper bound for an
odds ratio can be really high.

287
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,660
It might be something like 100.

288
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,060
I've seen ones that have 200, 300.

289
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,290
You know, ridiculously high.

290
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,590
Well, that's because when you
exponentiate,

291
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,440
you're putting back in that right hand
tail.

292
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,420
So the 95% confidence interval for

293
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,130
the natural log of the odds ratio is
symmetric, but for

294
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,580
the odds ratio itself, it's going to have
this, kind of, right skew.

295
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,320
So if you've ever wondered why that is,
that, that's the explanation.

296
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,870
So that's inferences for odds ratios.

297
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,370
Now moving on to just this question, how
to interpret odds ratios.

298
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,170
And then you have to again be very
cautious in your interpretation or

299
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,280
funny things can happen.

300
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,230
So, odds ratios give the increase or

301
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,540
decrease in the relative odds of the
outcome.

302
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,730
Of course, if you say that in your paper
people will look at you cross eyed.

303
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,970
There are certain situations where the
odds ratio can actually be interpreted as

304
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,470
a risk ratio and you'll okay, and this is
the case where you'll have rare outcome.

305
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,490
So if your outcome is rare, it turns out
that the odds ratio and

306
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,770
the risk ratio are pretty close to one
another.

307
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,800
In other words, if you say that, if you
interpret your odds ratio as

308
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,660
the increase or decrease in the risk of
the outcome, you won't be very far off.

309
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,938
The general rule of thumb is that as,

310
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:34,550
as the outcome incurs at less than 10% of,
say, your reference group,

311
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,520
that's rear enough where the, the odds
ratio and risk ratio are kind of similar.

312
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,990
They can be interpreted in, you know,

313
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,400
they can interpret the odds ratio as a
risk ratio.

314
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,690
However, when the outcome is more common
than this, the odds ratio can

315
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,910
distort the effect size quite a lot, and
you have to interpret things cautiously.

316
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,480
So, if you're doing a case control study,
generally case control studies are run on

317
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,170
rare outcomes so you're likely to have a
rare outcome and it's likely okay,

318
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,990
that you interpret that odds ratio as an
increase or decrease in risk.

319
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,820
However, when you're doing cohort study,
cross sectional study,

320
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:10,140
randomized trial, all of those usually
involve more common outcomes.

321
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,400
So if you apply logistic regression in one
of those cases and

322
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,150
you get all those odds ratios, be very
careful if your outcome is common and

323
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,550
make sure that you don't interpret those
odds ratios incorrectly.

324
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,750
And just to give you some more examples of
exactly how this works.

325
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,630
So imagine I have a situation where I have
a rare outcome.

326
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,740
Okay, so my outcome occurs in, you know,

327
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,090
3% of my exposed group and 1% of my
reference group.

328
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,180
So my risk ratio is three.

329
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,840
There's a three fold increase in risk in
the exposed group.

330
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,050
What would the corresponding odds ratio be
here?

331
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,650
So the odds ratio would be the risk.

332
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,900
The probability of something happening
divided by the probability of

333
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,540
it not happening.

334
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,110
So, 1 minus the risk.

335
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:55,110
So my odds, 3% divided by 97% is actually
still

336
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,680
pretty close to 3% because 97% is very
close to 1.

337
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,520
So you're essentially dividing by 1, it
doesn't change things much.

338
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,170
Similarly, in this denominator we would
divide 1% by 99%, but

339
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:11,100
that odds is essentially still 1% because
the 99% and the 97% are essentially 1.

340
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,200
We end up with a,

341
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,360
an odds ratio that's just slightly bigger
than the corresponding risk ratio.

342
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,520
If I were to say, hey, that's a threefold
increase in the risk in the exposed group,

343
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,640
I wouldn't be off, I wouldn't be far off,
that would be fine.

344
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,000
But compare that to the situation where we
have a common outcome.

345
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,650
So imagine that we have a situation where
my exposed group has

346
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,580
a 60% risk of having the outcome and my
reference group has a 20% risk.

347
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,370
The risk ratio's still three there.

348
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,010
But look what happen to the odds ration
now.

349
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,620
The odds ratio is calculated by doing the
odds of the exposed group.

350
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,480
That's 60% divided by 40% or three out of
two.

351
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,660
Very three to two.

352
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,033
Very different than 60%, and the odds for
the unexposed group is 20% divided by 80%.

353
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:55,540
When I calculate that out, it comes out to
be an odds ratio of six.

354
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,520
So it's quite distorted from the risk
ratio.

355
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,500
You would not want to look at this odds
ratio and

356
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,340
report it in your paper as a sixfold
increase in risk,

357
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,089
because clearly there's only a threefold
increase in risk.

358
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,120
So again, be careful with common outcomes.

359
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,915
And just to illustrate this a little
further, if you had HRP 259 in fall again,

360
00:19:12,915 --> 00:19:14,840
you can breeze through this, because I,

361
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,600
I've made a lot of these points already in
that class, because it's so important.

362
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,740
But if you have a rare outcome, your odds
ratio is also always going to be

363
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,590
slightly bigger than your risk ratio if
you have a harmful.

364
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,870
Something that's harmful a harmful effect
a risk ratio above one that means your

365
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,930
odds ratio is going to be bigger if you
have a protective effect a risk ratio

366
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,118
below one that means your odds ratio is
going to be a little bit smaller.

367
00:19:36,118 --> 00:19:41,325
But if it's a common outcome those
distortions can be much greater.

368
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:45,680
And there's actually a direct mathematical
relationship between the odds ratio and

369
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,810
risk ratio.

370
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:51,400
So remember, the odds ratio just involves
having the probabilities of

371
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,410
things not happening.

372
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:56,050
So we get these extra terms, mult, if we
multiply the risk ratio by

373
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,750
these extra probabilities of things not
happening.

374
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,580
That's the odds ratio.

375
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,740
So this is the direct mathematical
relationship between those two quantities.

376
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,850
If you're having rare outcome, clearly 1
minus something that

377
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,150
doesn't occur very often is going to be
close to one.

378
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,090
So, 1 minus 1% and

379
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,210
1 minus 2%, for example, that quantity
again is going to be very close to one.

380
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,650
This was what you might call the
distortion factor.

381
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,220
That distortion factor, if the outcome is
rare, is going to be close to one.

382
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,280
However, if the outcome is common, that
can,

383
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,360
distortion factor can be much different
than one.

384
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,390
That's the main point.

385
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,330
And people drawing, you know, graphs to
show exactly where this occurs.

386
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:37,550
This graph is sort of justifying that 10%
rule of thumb that I mentioned earlier.

387
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,800
So if you look at the graph here, you say
okay on the x axis, this is the risk or

388
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,260
prevalence of the outcome in the
unexposed, the reference group.

389
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,630
The y axis here shows you odds ratios for
different risk ratios.

390
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,620
So, if the risk ratio say is three,

391
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,670
if the real relationship is a three fold
increase in risk.

392
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:02,220
And you have a, a outcome that occurs in
10% of your reference group.

393
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,960
Notice that's going to distort the odds
ratio a little bit.

394
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,200
It's going to be closer to, you know, like
3.5, but not a huge amount.

395
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,810
And you can kind of see that within this
zone of 10% prevalence,

396
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,110
most of the alterations and restorations
are pretty close to one another.

397
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,610
However, if you go out to prevalence as
if, say, 30%, and you go out

398
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,360
to big odds ratios like 2.5, 3.0, you can
get odds ratios that are huge.

399
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,590
So for example, with a prevalence of 30%,
and a risk ratio of three,

400
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,940
your odds ratio might be something, you
know, like 15.

401
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,890
So huge.

402
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,110
A, a big distortion.

403
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,090
So you're going to be careful with common
outcomes and also the bigger.

404
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,170
The effect actually is the bigger this
distortion will be, too.

405
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,340
So, I'm just going to give you a few
examples of where you have to be

406
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,310
a little careful about these types of
things that pop up in the literature.

407
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,940
I just happened to be looking at something
the other day that somebody sent me

408
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,860
from an, this was in their abstract, and

409
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,000
I've changed things a little for anonymity
here.

410
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,170
But basically the abstract said the
outcome was twice as likely,

411
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,880
odds ratio is 2.2.

412
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,540
To occur in the experimental group
compared with the standard group.

413
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,920
What was funny here was that the authors
had actually put the percentage of

414
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,210
people that were affected in the
experimental and the standard group.

415
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,516
You can see it was 85%, about 85% versus
about 73%.

416
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:17,000
Well, clearly that's not a twice as likely
right?

417
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,160
I mean.
So 85% is not two times 73%.

418
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:24,080
So the odds ratio here was misinterpreted,
that twofold odds

419
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,870
ratio did not correspond to a doubling of
risk.

420
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,190
And the, you know, somebody who was
reviewing that paper picked that up, and

421
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,310
of course the reviewer didn't like that.

422
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,850
Another example, this was in a paper in
Neurology a few years back.

423
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,060
They were looking at patients with
dementia and they wanted to say whether or

424
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,310
not mortality, the mortality rate was
increased among

425
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,420
patient with dementia compared to
similarly aged patients without dementia.

426
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,180
And indeed they saw that 82% of

427
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,900
the patients with dementia died during the
study period versus 22% without dementia.

428
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,800
Well, that's clearly about a four-fold
increase in the risk of

429
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,150
death during the study period.

430
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,580
However, because the authors wanted to
adjust with things.

431
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,150
They ran a logistic regression.

432
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,440
The logistic regressions spit out an odds
ration of 16,

433
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,690
so you can see that that's really, you
know, high.

434
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,830
Clearly you do not want to interpret this
as a 16 fold increase in

435
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,870
the risk of death during the study period.

436
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,880
The risk ratio itself was only about four
as we saw on the previous slide.

437
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,270
Now fortunately the authors didn't really
dwell on this odds ratio.

438
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:31,300
Who they didn't interpret it incorrectly
but even reporting an odds ratio like that

439
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,780
sometimes can just be misleading because
readers might misinterpret that if

440
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,870
you don't frame that or put it in context
for your reader.

441
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,980
One more last example, this was from a
randomized trial looking at

442
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,490
a new diet drug and here's the table that
came out of that paper.

443
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,820
I'm just going to highlight a few things
here so, notice that even thought this was

444
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,960
a randomized trial a perspective study we
still are getting odds ratios here

445
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,490
because the authors wanted to adjust for
something.

446
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:01,370
So, the outcome that they were looking at
in this a top part of the table was the.

447
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,260
The chances of losing at least five
kilograms, so

448
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,870
you lost at least five kilograms or not, a
binary outcome.

449
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,880
So the calculated odds ratio, adjusting
for

450
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,590
a few things notice the odds ratios are
huge, right?

451
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,760
So, the odds ratio for low-dose versus
placebo, they were

452
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,280
trying different doses of this particular
drug, low-dose versus pla, placebo.

453
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,660
The odds ratio was four.

454
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,460
For the medium dose, it was 21, and for
the high dose it was nearly 32.

455
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,140
Clearly, there's not a 32 fold increase in
your chances of losing this much weight.

456
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,300
That's clearly a distorted effect size.

457
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,280
In, in, in fact, in this table you can
actually see the percentage of

458
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,350
people who lost that much weight in each
of the different groups.

459
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,590
So if you just look at the raw
percentages, well.

460
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:49,050
The placebo group had 29% of people losing
at least five kilograms.

461
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,610
Now it was much higher in the high dose
group, it was 91%.

462
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,940
But notice that a three fold increase in
risk,

463
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,320
a risk ratio of three, not a 32 fold
increase in risk.

464
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,980
So, in this case, yeah, I might even argue
that the odds ratio here, just,

465
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,390
I'm not even sure I would want to report
them in my paper.

466
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,400
Because they're so distorting.

467
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,370
And they actually don't have any effect
size value.

468
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,350
That is, when I look at this 31.

469
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,590
I can't look at a 31 and

470
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,210
make any conclusion about the magnitude of
the effect.

471
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,080
So I'd be a little careful about even
