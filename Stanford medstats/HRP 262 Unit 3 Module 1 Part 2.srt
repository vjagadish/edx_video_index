1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,930
Just to give some examples of the use of
Cox regression in the literature,

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,070
here's a study that I talked about in an
earlier module,

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,010
one of my favorite studies, it really
illustrates the idea of publication bias.

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,320
So I'm showing you the Kaplan-Meier Curve
from that study here.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,500
This study tracked people who were funded,
got grant money,

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,350
from the time they were funded until they
had their first major publication that

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,350
actually addressed the main question that
the grant was set up to answer.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,840
And they wanted to know does it matter in
terms of how fast you get published,

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,870
whether you found something significant or
you got a null result.

10
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,130
And in fact, the black line here, this is
time to publication.

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,990
So the outcome here is a good thing, you
want to be published.

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,680
So, the falling, the quickly falling line
here,

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,060
the black line, are the ones who actually
had a significant result.

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,790
You know, something like P is less than
0.05, or whatever.

15
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,280
The cut off they used.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,524
Those were published much faster than
people who got a null-result,

17
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,300
non-significant result.

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,300
It took longer to publish null-results.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,240
Even more interesting that there was this
in-between group,

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,340
where they had what people sometimes would
call a non-significant trend often,

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,930
that something like P was greater than
0.05, but less than 0.1.

22
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,860
And people say well, looks like something
maybe is there, and if I had a bigger

23
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,060
sample size That was even harder to get
published, and that took even more time.

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,810
So this gets at the idea of publication
bias,

25
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,830
that we rush things to publication because
it get a significant result even though

26
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,450
a null result may be just as important as
a significant one.

27
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,990
Well, that was the Kaplan-Meier Curve, and
that tells a lot of the story from this

28
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,680
data, but, again, it's not adjusted for
anything and we haven't

29
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,970
quantified the magnitude of this effect in
any way, other than just visually.

30
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,400
So they then, the authors then ran a Cox
regression on the same data.

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,720
So here's the corresponding Cox regression
to those data.

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,550
This is just a univariate Cox regression
so

33
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,920
they actually haven't even adjusted for
anything yet, but they could.

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,400
But even running a Cox regression buys us
that we get some estimates of effect here,

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,248
the effects size.

36
00:01:59,248 --> 00:02:02,780
So the Null group, those who came out with
null results,

37
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,168
was chosen as the reference groups so it's
set to 1.00.

38
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:11,530
The non-significant trend group was had a
decreased rate of publication so

39
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,460
the hez, the hazard ratio's below 1.

40
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,290
It does cross one here,

41
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,120
it's not a statistically significant
difference from the null group but you

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,160
can see there's some suggestion of that
group having a worse publication rate.

43
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,730
And finally, the significant group,

44
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,000
the ones who actually found significant
results, did have a statistically

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,620
significant increase in the publication
rate compared with the null group.

46
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,000
And we can interpret this hazard ratio as
basically having about

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,440
a twofold higher incidence of publication
compared to those will null results.

48
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,188
So it gives us an effect size we can
measure.

49
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:48,840
Second example a, of a use of Cox
regression in a literature

50
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,490
has to do with a series of studies that
were published that were looking at

51
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,960
Academy Award winners versus nominees, and
trying to get at this question,

52
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,820
people always say, well, it was just an
honor to be nominated.

53
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,700
Is it really as good to just be nominated
as it is to actually win,

54
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,920
at least for the outcome of longevity?

55
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,070
Researchers thought that there might be
some survival advantage if you

56
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,870
actually won versus only being nominated.

57
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,470
So there's actually more than one study
published on these data.

58
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,850
But the, I'm going to start with the study
that was published on the screenwriters.

59
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,775
I think it's interesting that the
screenwriters got a different result than

60
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:25,884
the actors and actresses.

61
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:30,425
So it's just fun to kind of show and
illustrate an example of Cox regression.

62
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:35,651
So this was the Kaplan Meier curve from
looking at the screenwriters and the blue

63
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:41,690
curve here is people who, actually screen
writers who actually won an Academy Award.

64
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,588
And the red are screenwriters who are only
nominated but never won.

65
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:51,260
And interestingly, it's the opposite of
what the authors found for actors and

66
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,730
actresses, the winners did worse, in terms
of longevity, than the nominees.

67
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,800
And, it's just interesting that it kind
of, it,

68
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,610
it reverses itself for the writers.

69
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,530
You can kind of think of some potential
reasons why.

70
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,040
Obviously I can't name too many
screenwriters who were,

71
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,930
won Academy Awards whereas I can probably
name a few actors and actresses.

72
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,060
That's probably winning an Academy Award
for

73
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,350
screenwriting doesn't give you the same
kind of social status and

74
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,560
visibility that an actor does for an actor
or an actress.

75
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,530
And maybe you know people who are really
great screenwriters, they drink more and

76
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,320
do more drugs, who knows, I, I'm just
making things up but,

77
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,560
in any case it was sort of interesting
that it turned out that way.

78
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,810
But that's the Kaplan-Meier curve.

79
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,940
Then you want to adjust for confounders,
get effect sizes so

80
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,240
you can run a Cox regression and that's
what the authors did next, they ran

81
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,130
a Cox regression on the screenwriter data,
that's what's shown here.

82
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,200
What you're seeing, are the results of
that regression.

83
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,590
They're showing you, they're not showing
you exactly the hazard ratios.

84
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,310
They're showing you the relative increase
in the death rate.

85
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,070
So they're directly related to the hazard
ratios, but

86
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,790
they're doing a little bit of translation
of the hazard ratios for you.

87
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,570
They think it, perhaps, makes it easier to
understand.

88
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,300
But basically, in their basic analysis,
when they didn't adjust for

89
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,590
anything, they got a hazard ratio of 1.37.

90
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,410
And they were interpreting that for the
reader as a 37% increase

91
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,750
in the mortality rate for winners compared
with nominees.

92
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,810
This was done, the data were collected
just on the internet, so

93
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,510
they didn't really have a ton of potential
confounders.

94
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,210
They had sort of things that you could
look up on the internet, but

95
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,980
they tried to adjust for those confounders
that they did have.

96
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,890
Adjusting for all of these nine factors
that changed into a hazard ratio of 1.35.

97
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,190
Essentially there was no change, so
nothing that they adjusted for really

98
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:38,710
accounted for this higher death rate in
the winners group for screen writers.

99
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,370
And again that's just a hazard ratio of
1.35.

100
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,480
So just an example of the use of Cox
regression.

101
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,120
This example has a lot of interesting
pieces to it.

102
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,770
However, it's just an interesting topic.

103
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,610
As I, alluded to in the overview for this
week, the,

104
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,280
they also looked, of course, at Academy
Award Winners for actors and actresses.

105
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,960
And for actors and actresses, they did
find a survival advantage in

106
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,400
the direction of the winners doing better
than the nominees only.

107
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,210
They looked at it with Kaplan-Meier as
well as with a Cox regression.

108
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:18,140
In the Cox regression, winners versus
nominees, the hazard ratio was 0.75.

109
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,928
So, winners being less likely to die
quickly.

110
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:24,580
And when they adjusted it went to, it
attenuated a little bit.

111
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,990
The hazard ratio was 0.78.

112
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,470
Again, proportional hazard regressions
also sometimes called Cox regressions.

113
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,120
So that, this is from a Cox regression.

114
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,670
Now what's interesting is if you think
carefully about what's going on with

115
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,600
these data.

116
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,300
You can probably think of a bias that's
going on here.

117
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,390
And indeed, some people reanalyze this
data worried about this particular bias,

118
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,040
and the bias is something called the
immortal time bias,

119
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,700
and rather than give it a fancy name, we
can just kind of describe it.

120
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,360
What's going on here is, if you look at
the Kaplan–Meier curve.

121
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,880
Think about the following.

122
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,420
There's a, a line for nominees and there's
a line for winners.

123
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,390
Drawing the line that way, and with
starting with time, you know,

124
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,230
this is time in age.

125
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,910
That so their age from birth to death.

126
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,750
So what's happening here is that we're
classifying people as winners and

127
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,020
nominees right from the moment they're
born.

128
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,416
But that's not quite right, right?

129
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:23,110
Some of the people in the winners group
were actually only ever nominated or

130
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,280
were in the control group before they were
ever winners.

131
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,820
So, it doesn't seem quite fair to count
them as winners from birth.

132
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:37,110
The problem is that living longer
increases your chances of being a winner.

133
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,560
Right.
If you die early in your life for

134
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,690
whatever reason, you then have no chance
of going on to

135
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,900
make an Academy Award winning movie
afterwards.

136
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,270
So, rather than winning, increasing your
chance of living longer,

137
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,510
it could be the case that the fact that
you live longer gave you more chance to

138
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,140
win an Academy Award so the causality
could be reversed here.

139
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,680
And because we just grouped people
statically that's not captured in

140
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,100
this analysis.

141
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,050
So, actually, some other authors went back
and tried to account for this immortal

142
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,980
time bias and tried to analyze the data in
different ways to account for this bias.

143
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,560
And so it's very interesting.

144
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,900
This generated a lot of debate in the
literature.

145
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,850
They're showing a bunch of things that
stated here, but in the re-analysis paper,

146
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,920
what they're showing you here is that, the
survival advantage that was

147
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,010
originally estimated from the original
authors was somewhere around four years.

148
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:32,590
And that was widely reported in the media
that the winners live about almost four

149
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,640
years longer than the nominees only group.

150
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,450
The reduction in mortality as we saw on a
previous slide, winners versus

151
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,546
nominated was about 25% corresponding to a
hazard ratio about 0.75.

152
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:49,028
When the authors of the reanalysis paper
relooked at that data,

153
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,624
they came out with reduced effects.

154
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:56,454
So when they reanalyzed their data using
proportional hazard regression but

155
00:08:56,454 --> 00:09:00,164
accounting for the fact that people
weren't always winners,

156
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:05,590
they're hazard ratio was now 0.7, 0.82 an
18% reduction in mortality.

157
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:10,190
So the winners did still have some
advantage but

158
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,150
notice that it was no longer statistically
significant that confidence in

159
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:18,160
one year crosses, zero, 0% reduction in
mortality rate.

160
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,980
So it attenuated the affect, not
completely to one but

161
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,980
now it's no longer significant and is a
smaller affect.

162
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,140
Showing that perhaps a lot of the original
affect that was found was due to

163
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,630
this particular bias and they estimated
the survival advantage for

164
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,300
winners versus nominees to be more on the
order of a year, and

165
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,840
again, not statistically significant.

166
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,090
And so, perhaps a lot of the original
finding had to

167
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,920
do with this particular bias.
