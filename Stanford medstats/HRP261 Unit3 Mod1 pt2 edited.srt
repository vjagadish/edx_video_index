1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,970
Well of course I don't think in odds so I
want to go one step further and

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,760
translate the odds to a probability.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,950
Well here are the odds the odds is just a
probability divided by

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,960
1 minus the probability.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,120
So we can actually solve for p here.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,570
So to solve for p, for example for this
first one.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,230
Then I multiply both sides of my equation
by 1 minus p.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:30,310
Then I'm going to get that p is equal to
8.33 minus 8.33 p.

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,510
I can add that negative, that 8.33 p.

10
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:40,530
I'm going to add 8.33 repeatable sides of
the equation here [SOUND].

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,130
Then I'm going to get 9.33 p is equal to
8.33.

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,280
Now to isolate p I'm going to divide both
sides of the equation by 9.33.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,560
A general formula here is, you would do, p
is equal to

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,590
the odds [SOUND] divided by 1 plus the
odds.

15
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,680
And when you do that, 8.33 divided by
9.33,

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,450
notice, that's always going to be a number
between 0 and 1.

17
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,000
So that's going to give you a probability
that comes out to be 89%.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,620
So the predictive probability for somebody
who does zero hours per week of

19
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,870
homework is they have an 89% of being book
smart.

20
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,040
Less homework, more chance of being book
smart.

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,550
When you do this for 10 hours per week,

22
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,830
you get 85% is the predictive probability
of being book smart.

23
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,830
For somebody who does 50 hours per week,
they're only, you know, 54% chance.

24
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,800
their predicted probability of being book
smart is only 54%.

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,970
Again, none of this is statistically
significant, but just in terms of

26
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,740
the effect sizes here, these would be the
predicted probabilities.

27
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,330
The other thing that is often more useful,
or more commonly used from the logistic

28
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,350
regression law is just to say what's the
relationship between the predictor and

29
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,710
the outcome in this case homework and book
smart.

30
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,630
And as I mentioned earlier the, the beta
coefficient from logistic regression,

31
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,090
what happens is, is if you exponentiate
that beta coefficient from

32
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,780
logistic regression When you exponentiate
that, that gives you an odds ratio.

33
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,170
So we can take this beta for homework here
and

34
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,120
we can exponentiate it and so we can raise
that to point, negative .0389.

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,420
When you do that you come out with a value
of 0.96.

36
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,559
So that's the odds ratio here.

37
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,810
I'll show you in a minute why you can
interpret the beta like this.

38
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:26,940
But what this means is, we have quantified
the relationship between homework

39
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,650
time and your odds of being book smart.

40
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,560
And you would read this odds ratio of 0.96
to say that there is

41
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,200
a 4% decrease in your odds of being book
smart for

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,500
every one hour more that you spend on
homework per week.

43
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,900
So, if I just exponentiate that beta the
units here

44
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,700
are one hour of homework per week.

45
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,820
Notice now we've got an odds ratio for

46
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,860
a continuous predictor, you can get that
at a logistic regression.

47
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,960
So now we're talking about the increase in
odds for

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,880
a 1 unit increase in the continuous
predictor.

49
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,690
Everything up to now,

50
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,660
when we've done odds ratios, we've been
talking about a binary predictor.

51
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,390
You're either in this group, or you're
not.

52
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,130
But now we can get odds ratios for
continuous predictors.

53
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,880
Well, how does that translate?

54
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,120
How does that beta, become an odds ratio?

55
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,340
Exactly how does that work?

56
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,510
So let me show you that now.

57
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,100
How do we get from beta to odds ratios?

58
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,910
Well, what is an odds ratio?

59
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,300
If I want to know the odds ratio for being
book smart, for the exposure here, which

60
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,200
is more homework time compared to less
homework time, what is the odds ratio?

61
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,210
An odds ratio is a ratio of two odds.

62
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,540
So my odds ratio here would be the odds of
being book smart for somebody who

63
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,970
does more homework, compared with the odds
of being book smart Book smart for

64
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,770
somebody who spends less time on homework.

65
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,540
And if we're just going with units that
I've used here, or

66
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,270
the difference between the numerator and

67
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,410
the denominator, I could make it a one
hour difference in homework time.

68
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,910
So what's my odds ratio for

69
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,430
a one hour change, a one hour increase in
homework time?

70
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,320
How does that affect my odds of being book
smart Well, now I can just fill in,

71
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,880
I fit a model that tells me that predicted
odds of being book smart for

72
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,080
a given homework level.

73
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,730
So I can just plug in that model.

74
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,790
So what's the odds of being book smart for
somebody who does, say,

75
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,890
one hour of homework, compared with
somebody who does zero hours of homework?

76
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,190
The odds, which I can put in the
numerator, so, I fit the model that says,

77
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,290
the log odds is alpha plus beta homework
times the amount of homework.

78
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,890
If I exponentiate that number I get the
odds.

79
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,830
So the odds of being book smart for

80
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,000
somebody who does one hour of homework, I
can put that in the numerator.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,700
I can compare that to the odds of being
book smart for

82
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,410
somebody who does no homework.

83
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,540
So now I made a ratio of two odds, the
odds for somebody who does one hour of

84
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,010
homework, divided by the odds of somebody
who does no homework.

85
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,550
And then we can simplify this a little bit
what you'll notice right away is

86
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,960
a you have to know a little bit about how
exponentials work to

87
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,180
know how I lecture them here to here but
if you have e raised to

88
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,840
a alpha plus beta that's the same as e
raised to alpha times e raised to beta.

89
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,360
Well notice there, they both have the same
intercepts, So

90
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,610
those intercepts we're going to cancel.

91
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,850
That's the nice thing here, those cancel
and if we simplify this.

92
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,890
It just turns out, that we're left with if
e Beta times 1 in the numerator, divided

93
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,190
by e raise to 0 in the denominator, that's
just e raised to Beta Homework.

94
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,630
And so that's.

95
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,570
The odds ratio.

96
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,390
You take the beta from homework, you
exponentiate it, you get the odds ratio.

97
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,790
The actual value for the beta here was
negative .039.

98
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,960
Again, if I exponentiate that, I get an
odds ratio of .96.

99
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,450
So the odds ratio of 0.96 means that for
every one hour increase in

100
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,240
homework per week, your odds of believing
yourself" book smart" decreases by 4%.

101
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,150
Of course, it wasn't significant here.

102
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,470
I want to just extend this logic to show
how not only can we get

103
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:53,080
odds ratios out of logistic regression, We
can get multivariate adjusted odds ratio.

104
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,420
So just as we made the leap from linear
regression, simple linear regression to

105
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,420
multivariate linear regression, we can do
the same thing with logistic regression.

106
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,380
It's very easy to add additional
predictors to the right side of

107
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,820
the equation.

108
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,430
We can have a bunch of predictors just
like this.

109
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,310
That's our multivariate logistic equation.

110
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,800
And here's some examples.

111
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,990
Imagine, that we did a study where we were
looking at lung cancer.

112
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,800
And let's say for the first logistic
regression model we fit, we put in as

113
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,690
predictors a binary predictor for smoking
and a binary predictor for drinking.

114
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,570
So we looked at smoking, yes or no, and
drinking, yes or no.

115
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,980
Those are two binary variables.

116
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,510
So that's one model we can fit and that's
a simpler model so

117
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,840
I'm going to start there.

118
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,070
The beta for smoking would then represent
the effect of smoking adjusted for

119
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,000
drinking, the beta for

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,230
drinking represents the effect of drinking
adjusted for smoking.

121
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,270
We can make it slightly more complicated
by also adding an additional variable,

122
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,630
additional predictor in the model, let's
add also age.

123
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,960
We could then get the effective smoking
adjusted for

124
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,250
both drinking and age, the effect of
drinking adjusted for both smoking and

125
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,380
age, and the effect of age adjusted for
both smoking and drinking.

126
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,960
Let me show you now exactly what I mean by
adjusted for.

127
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,510
When I keep using that term, adjusted for,
what does that really mean?

128
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,630
That means that if I fix everything else
in the model,

129
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,280
it's the isolated effect of smoking, or
the isolated effect of drinking.

130
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,290
So let me show you that mathematically
now, I think it's helpful.

131
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,120
I'm going to start with the binary
predictor,

132
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,490
the model with the 2 binary predictors
because it's simpler.

133
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,240
Again what's an odds ratio?

134
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,860
It's the odds of a disease, say lung
cancer for

135
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,420
an exposed group compared with the odds of
disease for an unexposed group.

136
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,750
If I have just a binary predictor, say,
exposed and unexposed drinker and

137
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,580
nondrinker, smoker and nonsmoker, that's
what an odds ratio is.

138
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,830
My logistic regression model models the
odds of disease for given people.

139
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,710
So I can put in the numerator the odds of
disease for, say, a drinker, and

140
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:57,000
I could put in the denominator the odds of
Disease lung cancer here for a non drinker

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,840
and that's what I've done here so my model
my first model had alcohol and smoking two

142
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,600
binary predictors in it, so if I want to
know the odds ratio for drinking.

143
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,630
Adjusted for smoking, I can just say let
me compare, in the numerator the odds for

144
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,320
a drinker, and in the denominator the odds
for a nondrinker.

145
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,590
So there I put in a 1 for drinking, and a
[INAUDIBLE] in the numerator, and a 0 for

146
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,190
drinking in the denominator.

147
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,940
Now I'm comparing the odds of lung cancer
for a drinker, compared with the odds for

148
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,279
lung cancer with a nondrinker.

149
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,030
Now, I've also got smoking in the model,
so I have to put something in for smoking.

150
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,360
But what if I hold it fixed?

151
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,430
So what if I say I'm only comparing a
drinking smoker to a non-drinking smoker,

152
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,380
so I put in a 1 for smoking for both the
numerator and the denominator.

153
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,580
I hold smoking fixed.

154
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,320
It actually wouldn't matter if I chose to
compare a drinking-non smoker to

155
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,130
a drinking non-smoker.

156
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,390
I just have to hold smoking fixed for both
the numerator and the denominator.

157
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,040
I have to make it the same.

158
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,430
If I make it the same what you can show is
again the intercepts cancel and

159
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:02,290
now as long as I hold smoking fixed the
the smoking betas cancel.

160
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,500
What am I left Well, if I simplify this,

161
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,540
I just have e raised to beta alcohol, e
raised to zero and the denominator is 1,

162
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,900
so I can show that the odds ratio for
drinking, if I hold smoking fixed,

163
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,720
is I just, all I do is take the beta for
alcohol and exponentiate it.

164
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,970
That gives me the odds ratio for lung
cancer for

165
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,070
a drinker compared to a non-drinker.

166
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,730
And again, where I've held smoking
constant.

167
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,810
Notice, that this will be the odds ratio
for

168
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,040
drinking if I compare two smokers, or if I
compare two non-smokers.

169
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,920
Course so I'm assuming that the effect of
drinking is

170
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,130
the same in smokers and nonsmokers.

171
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,570
I can use the same logic to show you that
this works for

172
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,220
a continuous predictor as well.

173
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,150
So here's a continuous predictor.

174
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,660
For a continuous predictor, I'm going to
be comparing again the odds disease for

175
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,240
someone with a higher level of the
continuous predictor compared to

176
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,870
somebody with the lower level.

177
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,770
For example, image that I've got my second
model here that's got alcohol,

178
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,280
smoking, and age in the model.

179
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,110
Age is a continuous predictor.

180
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,670
If I want to compare in the numerator an
older person,

181
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,050
the odds of lung cancer of an older person
compared with the odds of

182
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,190
smoking of a younger person in the
denominator.

183
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,620
This will give me the odds ratio for an
increase in age.

184
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,400
How much does age affect my odds of lung
cancer?

185
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,300
I'm again going to hold all the other
variables in the models, here, alcohol and

186
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,310
smoking, I'm going to hold those fixed.

187
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,780
So say I have two drinking smokers.

188
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,330
And I'm comparing a drinking smoker who's
29 years old to a drinking smoker who's

189
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,680
only 19 years old.

190
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,040
That's a ten unit jump in age.

191
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,670
And you'll see it wouldn't really matter
if I had put in 40 and 30, or 50 and 40.

192
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,480
Any ten unit jump in age is going to give
me the answer here.

193
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,610
You'll notice that lots of things cancel
out.

194
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,540
That's the great thing here.

195
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,160
So we fix all the other variables.

196
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,910
They all cancel out.

197
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:58,490
So we're left with, at the beta for age,
in this case if we solve it here.

198
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,810
Beta, e raised to beta times 29, minus e
raised to beta 19,

199
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,820
that's the same as e raised to beta age
times 10,

200
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,010
so what this tells us is that if I
multiply the beta for age, times 10,

201
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:16,350
and then exponentiate, I will get the odds
ratio for a 10 unit jump in age.

202
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,460
So this would give me, for a 10 unit jump
in age, a decade increase in age,

203
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,350
what's the increase in my odds of getting
lung cancer.

204
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,180
If I wanted to do it for a one unit
increase in age,

205
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,610
I would just take the beta for age and
exponentiate it directly,

206
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,630
that would give me the odds ratio for a
one unit Increase in age.

207
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,100
It doesn't really matter what you pick for
the units of age, but

208
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,450
you want to pick something that's sort of
meaningful a one unit or

209
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,250
ten unit increase is probably reasonable.

210
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,180
That gives you the odds ratio for that
unit jump.

211
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,930
You can see that for

212
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,550
a continuous predictor, the magnitude of
the odds ratio will depend on the units.

213
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,790
It's not going to, what units you choose
will not affect the p value but

214
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,980
it will affect how big or small that odds
ratio looks.

215
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,670
Just keep that in mind.

216
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,440
You always have to get the units in your
table so

217
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,750
people know how to interpret that.

218
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,740
This is the odds ratio for H adjusted, for
smoking and alcohol.

219
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,030
Which means that we've held smoking and
alcohol fixed.

220
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,280
So that is if we're looking at two people
who have the same level of smoking and

221
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,160
alcohol and the only difference between
them is a ten unit difference in age,

222
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,960
this would be the effect of that age.

223
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,990
So just to summarize, the practical
interpretation here is if you

224
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,800
take the beta, the slow from a logistic
regression for any of your exposures,

225
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,620
your predictors, and you exponentiate it
you get the odds ratio for the exposure.

226
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,310
You would interpret that as that is the
increase in the odds of your outcome for

227
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,370
every one unit increase in the exposure,
adjusted for, controlling for,

228
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:46,130
all the other variables all the other
predictors that are in the model.

229
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:53,140
And we'll practice looking at an example
of how to use this in the next module.

230
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,040
Just to tell you most computer packages
when you run a logistics regression you

231
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,470
don't actually have to even do the
exponentiation.

232
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,550
Most computer packages will automatically
give you the odds ratio.

233
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,440
So again out of a logistic regression we
get these

234
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,020
multivariate adjusted odds ratios.
