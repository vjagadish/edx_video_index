2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,010
Last week we talked about how to test
whether or not your continuous variable

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,420
really does have a linear relationship
with the logit of the outcome.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,750
Which is what the logistic model assumes.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,100
This week we are going to talk about what
to do if your variable does

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,710
not have a linear relationship.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,460
So last week I showed you various plots,
logit plots,

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,840
which plot the logit of the outcome.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,460
In this case, for this graph of the
outcome here was low bone density.

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,556
Against a continuous predictor in this
case the predictor here was

11
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:43,130
the number of menstrual periods in the
past year.

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,346
And in general for women if they are
having irregular periods they have

13
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,031
a higher chance of having low bone density
you can see that here.

14
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:51,989
As women have more regular periods they
have a lower chance of

15
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,295
having low bone density.

16
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:57,057
And the relationship here looks nice and
linear, it's really pretty close to

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,534
a straight line, so if we were to just put
menstrural periods in the model

18
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:05,340
without doing any kind of transformation
It seems to nicely fit a straight line.

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,500
So that one does look linear in the logit.

20
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,200
In the last module I talked about the,

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,970
the data on women runners that I'd been
looking at, and

22
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,150
it turned out that fat mass was protective
against stress fractures in that group.

23
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,410
Again, probably because.

24
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,740
Fat mass increases the period regularity.

25
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,280
And so the graph here is showing the logit
of stress fractures,

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,800
that's my binary outcome, and the
predictor here is fat mass.

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,660
And this fat mass variable was turned into
Z scores,

28
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,100
as we talked about in an earlier module.

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,200
And you can see that, indeed, as women go
up in fat mass,

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,540
they seem to go down in their logit of
stress fractures in a nice linear pattern.

31
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,220
So this one would also be, meet the linear
in the logit assumption.

32
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,020
I also showed you last week a couple of
graphs.

33
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,970
We are, we did not meet the linearity in
the logit assumption.

34
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,940
And so here are two examples shown again
here.

35
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,950
So in the last panel this was a study
looking at cardiovascular disease.

36
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:12,050
So we have the logit of cardiovascular
disease on the y-axis.

37
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,760
And on the x-axis, axis we have smoking.

38
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,950
And you can see that it doesn't have a
nice linear relationship as you

39
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,030
go from being a non-smoker to a smoker.

40
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,590
There's a huge, steep, rise in your risk
of cardiovascular disease.

41
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,720
But then things seem to level off.

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,880
They're sort of diminishing returns as you
increase the level of smoking,

43
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,800
you're still increasing your risk but not
quite as steeply.

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,500
So it looks like it has a little bit more
of a quadratic relation.

45
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,020
Now this one might be well modeled by
changing your

46
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,460
smoking variable into categories, right?

47
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,500
Rather than modeling it as a continuous
variable,

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,120
you might say non-smoke versus light
smokers, versus heavy smokers.

49
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,720
Or something like that.

50
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,350
Now in the right hand panel, I showed you
these data on typhosis, so this was,

51
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,900
the outcome here was Having spinal
curvature, or

52
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,850
kyphosis, after corrective spine surgery
in children.

53
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,000
The age here, the predictor variable is
age, and it's measured in months.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,630
And we saw last week that there's a nice
quadratic relationship here.

55
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,530
The middle ages are at higher risk than
the younger and older ages.

56
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,850
That one was well modeled as a squared
variable because of the quadratic.

57
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,310
So, what do we do when we find that our
predictor variable violates linearity?

58
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,240
We have a couple of choices.

59
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,430
So we can transform the variable
mathematically in some ways.

60
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,800
So I've shown you an example where we took
the square of the variable.

61
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,920
There might be other instances where
taking the log of the variable

62
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,060
accomplishes making it linear with the log
then.

63
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,820
You also might in some cases choose to
break up

64
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,920
your continuous variable into a
categorical variable and

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,220
there's a lot of times clinically there
might be some natural clinical category.

66
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,570
So if it doesn't appear to be linear the
log may be treated divided into those

67
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,160
Clinically meaningful categories.

68
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,150
Just to illustrate both of those with one
more example,

69
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,180
here's a data set that was looking at
predictors of low birth weight.

70
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,700
And of course, one of the predictors that
you might expect to to be

71
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,800
a predictor of low birth weight is
maternal age.

72
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,910
however, if you were just to take these
data and throw maternal age into

73
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,460
the model, so we're modeling here the
logit of low birth weight.

74
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:26,030
But if you were to just throw age in as a
linear variable into the model and

75
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,230
run that model, here's the results that
you get.

76
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,780
So here's maternal age.

77
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,210
Our beta is practically zero and our p
value is totally non-significant.

78
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,380
In other words it looks like age has
absolutely no relationship with

79
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,810
low birth weight.

80
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,610
Now, something seems a little wrong there,
because I think most of us know that

81
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,910
indeed maternal age does relate to low
birth weight.

82
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,809
Well, of course we didn't plot our
variable which is always a mistake.

83
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,020
So now let me show you the plots for this
variable.

84
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,660
Here as I have plotted the plotted the low
gen of low birth weight compared to

85
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,840
maternal age.

86
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,580
And I've done one plot where I used ten
bins and another plot where I used five.

87
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,740
Remember when you are using these plots,
you have to be ale to group people.

88
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,830
To calculate probabilities and therefore
odds.

89
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,560
And so the bin size will slightly,

90
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,220
that you choose will slightly change the
what you see in your graph.

91
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,220
In this case I had a fairly big data set
so

92
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,430
I could easily break it into ten bins and
get a meaningful plot.

93
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,670
But the ten bin plot and the five bin plot
look pretty much the same to me.

94
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:34,050
I'm seeing a clean quadratic relationship,
where the younger and older ages have

95
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,880
higher risks of low birth weights than the
ages in between, somewhere in the 20s

96
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,190
looks to be about, or about the the mid to
late 20s looks to be the optimal age.

97
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,090
So what do we do?
It's a clearly not linear, and notice.

98
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,400
When I just throw age into the model
without thinking about it, what I'm

99
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,410
asking the computer to do is just to find
the best fit line for these points.

100
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,330
The best fit line for these points is
basically just a straight horizontal line,

101
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,390
and that's why we see no relationship.

102
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,630
That's because there is not a linear
relationship here, but

103
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,320
there is a quadratic relationship.

104
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,090
So, how am I going to deal with this?

105
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,790
Again I might end up just saying, well
it's a quadratic.

106
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,820
So, I'm going to put in the square of my
predictor variable.

107
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,050
So, I tried that.

108
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,240
And indeed when you model it as the
square, so I'm going to

109
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,220
put age in as a linear term and than the
higher order term of age squared.

110
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,660
Notice that both of those indeed turn out
to be statistically significant once I've

111
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,920
got the correct function here.

112
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,530
The only problem with using a square here
is it's a little

113
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,170
bit hard to explain exactly what these
beta coefficients mean,

114
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,200
it's going to be hard to calculate odds
ratios.

115
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,210
It's a little bit harder to explain to
your leader, and so

116
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,740
in this case it might be more natural to
take this graphic and

117
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,900
say well what is it actually mean, what is
the quadratic relationship mean.

118
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,130
It really means that very young women and
very old, well not very old, just older

119
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,380
women reproductively those groups have
higher risks than the, the women in their.

120
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,270
Or 20s who have sort of have more of the
optimum age for reproduction.

121
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,340
So it might be natural actually to divide
this up in to these data,

122
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,550
up in to categories that tells a cleaner
and neater story.

123
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,280
So I then did that.

124
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,180
The categories I chose here are a little
bit arbitrary,

125
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,500
they're sort of based on what I, the
pattern I saw in the graphic, but

126
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,280
you might want to chose sort of clinically
meaningful categories.

127
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,480
But basically had a, you know,

128
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,410
sort of young, pre haven't graduated from
the college age.

129
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,480
And an older age, here, is just above 30.

130
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,830
Which isn't really old but a little bit
older reproductively.

131
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,910
And then the middle age is sort of the
optimal age, it's in between 22 and 30.

132
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,100
And when I compare those three groups in
a, logistic regression.

133
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,400
Dummy coding them.

134
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,860
I end up with that older age versus being
of the optimal age get an odds

135
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,080
ratio of about 2.3, so they have about
double the odds of low birth weight.

136
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,670
And similarly, the young age versus that
optimal middle age also has an odds

137
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,170
ratio of about a doubling of the, of the
odds of low birth weight.

138
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,125
So it may be conceptually preferable, in
this case,

139
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,296
to divide that continuous variable up into
categories.

140
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:10,130
