1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,290
The correct answer for this question is d,
only, the standard error of the mean.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,710
This is because when we have 246 patients,
we, that is quite a lot of patients.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,430
The central limit theorem would have
started kicking in already.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,430
So we would have the mean, the median, and
the standard deviation for

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,680
the sample to be closer to the mean, the
median, and the standard deviation for

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,180
the total population.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,480
We wouldn't expect those parameters to
change very much if we had it,

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,520
added a hundred people.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,692
But the the standard error of the mean,
which decreases directly with

10
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:33,436
the number of Samples that we have in a
sample size would definitely go down if we

11
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:38,470
added a hundred people to the number of
patients that we have.

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,954
In this case, because we have a very small
sample size of only 13, we need to opt for

13
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:46,350
a T-distribution as opposed to the normal
distribution.

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,292
A d-distribution has one less degrees of
freedom that a number of

15
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:53,300
the population of the sample.

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,148
In this case because we have 13 people-,

17
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:59,230
children in the sample the degrees of
freedom turn out to be 12.

18
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,257
The formula for

19
00:01:00,257 --> 00:01:07,300
the standard error is given by standard
deviation divided by the square root.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,210
Of the number of observations in the
sample.

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:17,880
And if we substitute the values that we
have, this comes out to 0.23.

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,872
This tells us that a is the right answer.

23
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:27,701
For this question, we know that the mean
is .66.

24
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:32,751
How do we notice this, is because we have
20 patients out of 30

25
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:38,718
who improve based on the exercise test,
test.

26
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:43,566
We also know that a standard error is
given by the formula P

27
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:49,538
times 1 minus p by a n in this case P is
0.66.

28
00:01:49,538 --> 00:01:55,550
1 minus p is 0.33 and n is 30.

29
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:00,650
So we have a standard error of 0.086.

30
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,580
The confidence interval is now given by
the mean which is 0.66.

31
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,074
Plus or minus a z score that is pointing
to a 95 percent confidence interval which

32
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:16,240
is 1.96 multiplied by the value of the
standard error that it is calculated,

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,940
this turns out to be 50 to 84 percent.

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,981
Let's use the formula that we have for

35
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:31,320
the [UNKNOWN] calculator using the value
that we have in the two by two table.

36
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:40,190
This comes out to be 10 by 40 divided by 5
by 55, which is an odds ratio of 2.75.

37
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,638
B wants us to take the natural log...

38
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:50,613
Off the oz ratio that we found,

39
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:57,630
which is .75, which is 1.01.

40
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,030
You know that the formula for the standard
error of the log of

41
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:10,140
the odd ratio is given by by 10 this one
by 40, this one by 5, this one by 55.

42
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,932
This turns out to be .586.

43
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:21,062
The 95% confidence in material is now
given in new by plus or minus one point.

44
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:24,390
9 6, times the standard error.

45
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,358
In this case it's 1.01, plus,

46
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:35,210
minus 1.96 times .586.

47
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,860
Which is an old issue of 1.44 To 2.16.

48
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:44,760
This question wants us to exponentiate the
values we found in d.

49
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,233
So we have the confidence interval in
terms of odds ratio as opposed to log of

50
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:51,170
odds ratio.

51
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,740
So that would be an exponential of minus
1.4, which would be the lower bound.

52
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:02,735
Exponential of 2.16 which is an
exponential of the upper bound and

53
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:12,230
in terms of the odd ratio we get the
confidence interval to be .87 to 8.66.

54
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,540
The answer to 'F' is false.

55
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,556
The confidence intervals of the laws of an
odd ratio as symmetric as we

56
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:20,553
just found but when we exponentiate the
symmetry is lost.

57
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:26,130
And the confidence interval of the actual
odds ratio is not symmetric.

58
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,380
The answer to G is true.

59
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,630
The 95% confidence interval for the oz
ratio crosses one, so

60
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,786
we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

61
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:40,966
And thus we know that b is greater 0.05.

62
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:46,212
Part A of this question wants us to
roughly estimate

63
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:54,286
the two sided p value associated with this
distribution.

64
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:58,570
If we down the number of observations we
have to the left of negative 25 and to

65
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,194
the right of 25, we'll see they're about
25 observation out of a thousand that have

66
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:10,490
these values, on which are on the left or
the right data correspondingly.

67
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,365
This translates to a two sided B value of
.025 In

68
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:20,240
this question we know that the mean is
zero, and

69
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:29,070
x is 27, and that the standard deviation
is 12.3.

70
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:36,320
This means that the z-score is 2.2.

71
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,666
This corresponds to a probability Value of
.014 now because we are looking a two

72
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:46,850
sided 'p' values and not one sided 'p'
values we can multiply this by '2' and so

73
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:52,840
the final probability comes out to .028.

74
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,040
The next question asks us how would the
histogram would change if I

75
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,039
ran the simulation of a 10,000 times
rather than 1000 times.

76
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:01,370
And the correct answer is 1.

77
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,962
That it will simply be smoother because as
we have more and

78
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:07,040
more observations the center limit harem
will start kicking in, and

79
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,840
we will have a more and more normal
looking distribution.

80
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,280
When we have ten times more values, this
distribution will look ten times smoother.

81
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,390
The correct answer to 'D' is two.

82
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,194
The sample size of the hypothetical trial
is larger,

83
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:25,600
which is the reason that the 'p' value is
lower.

84
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,812
This question gives us the percentage of
US adults Who had five or

85
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:34,980
more drinks in one day at least once in a
given year.

86
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,510
And we have trends for, let's see, we have
trends for seven years.

87
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,100
We have the mean value as well as the 95%
confidence intervals given.

88
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,572
The question wants us to find for which
years we could reset the null

89
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:52,376
hypothesis that more than 20% of US adults
had five or more drinks in one day.

90
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:55,750
At a 0.25 significance level.

91
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,723
The answer is 2000 and 2003 only.

92
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:06,440
Because these are the only two confidence
intervals which don't cross 20.

93
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,020
And these are the only two confidence
intervals for

94
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,395
which we can safely reject the null
hypothesis.
