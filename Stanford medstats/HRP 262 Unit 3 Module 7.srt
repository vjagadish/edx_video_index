1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,800
In this next module, I'm going to tell you
about a neat little trick available in

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,130
cart regression called stratification.

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:18,310
So, let's say you test for proportional
hazards for a particular variable,

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,899
and you find that that assumption is
violated, then what do you do?

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,960
So, the first thing you should do is to
try to understand why?

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,960
What's going on underneath the problem,
biologically, what, what have you,

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,140
that could explain why we're seeing a
violation of proportional hazards?

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,200
So, first really try to grapple with
understanding why?

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,360
Then auctions for sort of assumptions.

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,730
We talked about adding a time by covariate
interaction in the model.

11
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:52,500
If you're doing that, if you're adding a
time by covariate interaction,

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,550
what you're essentially saying is that
you're modeling an extra beta in there,

13
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,310
that tells you that you're, the beta for

14
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,600
your covariate is increasing or decreasing
linearly.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,700
With time.

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,710
That model would be the correct model for
certain situations, and

17
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,870
it might not be correct for, for other
situations.

18
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,500
But if indeed, that's the correct model or
a reasonable approximation,

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,310
that would be one way to deal with the
proportional hazards is to,

20
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,570
explicitly model the fact that the hazard
ratio is changing over time.

21
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,750
There are other options if it doesn't
quite fit increasing or

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,950
decreasing linearly with time, there are
other options such as

23
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,940
adding a time-dependent version of the
co-variate of interest, and

24
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,690
that's something we're going to get into
next week.

25
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,600
A third option is to stratify on that
variable.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,630
If you stratify on the variable, you don't
have to meet proportional hazards.

27
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,190
You will end up not getting a hazard
ratio.

28
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,250
You won't be estimating a hazard ratio for
that variable, but for

29
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,440
many nuance things that you just need to
adjust for, but you don't really care

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,940
about the effect, stratification turns
about to be a very reasonable option.

31
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,270
The other option is there may be some
situations where you violate proportional

32
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,710
hazards, but you don't end up modifying
your model in any way.

33
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,380
You can imagine that there might be a case
where the hazard ratio does seem to

34
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,470
be changing somewhat over time.

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,350
But, perhaps the summary hazard ratio,

36
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,830
a single hazard ratio, sort of an average
over time is a reasonable summary.

37
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,490
Captures the take home message reasonably
well, so

38
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,750
you may end up just reporting that, but of
course you'll want to note in your

39
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,900
paper that there was a violation, and what
kinds of effects that could have.

40
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,840
But for this module, I'm going to be
focusing on stratification.

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,880
I actually think the easiest way to
understand stratification is to start with

42
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,220
the likelihood function.

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,170
If you see what's going on in the
likelihood function, I think.

44
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,490
Stratification makes perfect sense.

45
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,680
So, this is a little complicated but I
already took this simple data set and

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,950
I, I drew out part of the likelihood
function just so

47
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,760
I wouldn't have to sit here and, and write
everything out which takes time.

48
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,790
But here is the idea with stratification.

49
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,190
This is a data set which.

50
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,170
We've got, time to event, whether or not
the person died,

51
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,860
age, we're going to have a model here, Cox
Regression

52
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,400
model, with one predictor in the model,
which is age.

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,420
So the beta I'm writing down here is the
beta for age.

54
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,350
Age, and we're going to stratify on
gender.

55
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,260
How does that actually get incorporated
into the likelihood function?

56
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,440
That's what this slide is showing.

57
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,840
So here is gender, one is male, zero is
female.

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,200
So, we're going to start the likelihood
function,

59
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,590
remember the likelihood function, put the
term in the model for every event time.

60
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,120
So, first event happens at times equals
one.

61
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,260
That event occurred in a male, the male
was 60 years old.

62
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,630
So, when we add a term to the likelihood
function, we are only going to

63
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:42,330
put men into that strata, into that term
in the likelihood function.

64
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,700
In other words, we are only going to be
care, comparing men to men.

65
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,400
So, what you'll notice is that when I
wrote out this first term in

66
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,020
the likelihood function, for time 1, I
only have men in the numerator and the.

67
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,280
In the risk set in the denominator.

68
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,360
So I've got the person who died, was a 60
year old male.

69
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,990
So they get their hazard their chance of
dying at one month is

70
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,240
e raised to the baseline hazard function
and

71
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,940
I'm explicitly putting it in here just to
show you.

72
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,870
How it kind of factors in and then we have
a beta for age in the model.

73
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,500
So, times e raised to beta times the
person's age.

74
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,720
This person was 60.

75
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,940
So, the person who died goes in the
numerator there were four men at

76
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,280
risk at time 1.

77
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,840
The 60 year old the 55 year old man, the
60 year old and the 50 year old.

78
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,680
So, I put a term in the denominator for

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,140
each one of them, representing their
probability of dying at time 1.

80
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,330
So, here's the person who actually died.

81
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,050
Here's the 55 year old, the 60 year old,
and the 50 year old.

82
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,380
Notice that they all have the same,

83
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,190
we're assuming that they all have the same
hazard at one month into the study.

84
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,930
And some hazard rate that we can cancel.

85
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,460
But we're only canceling the hazard rate.

86
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,520
For men to men.

87
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,920
So, everybody in this term is a male,

88
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,620
we're cancelling out those hazard rates
for men.

89
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,700
We have, don't have any women, we have
kept, we're keeping the men and

90
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,360
the women separate in the likelihood here.

91
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,150
Now let's go to time 0.3.

92
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,900
At time 0.3 there's another event.

93
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,610
This event happens to be a woman who dies.

94
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,470
She's 65 years old.

95
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,550
What goes in the likelihood?

96
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,950
So, we're going to have a term.

97
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,090
The woman who died, she gets a term in the
likelihood that's e raised to

98
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,990
the baseline hazard at 3 times the effect
of age, essentially.

99
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,830
I've indicated here again that there's
the, the hazard rate for

100
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,670
females at [INAUDIBLE].

101
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,610
Three is female specific.

102
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,950
It might be different than the hazard rate
would be for men.

103
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,870
But we're only care, comparing women to
women so

104
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,530
there's three women in the denominator,
the 65 year old, the 45 year old, and

105
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,250
the 40 year old, who were all the ones.

106
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,780
Who were at risk at time 3.

107
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,230
So again, only comparing women to women,
so,

108
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,300
means we're canceling out the baseline
hazards for women at this time point.

109
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,700
We're assuming it's all the same.

110
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,360
But we've made no assumptions whatsoever
about the relationship between

111
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,990
the hazard function for men, the baseline
hazard function for

112
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,830
men, and the baseline hazard function for
women.

113
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,750
In other words, if we plotted over time,
the baseline hazard function for

114
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,870
men might look like this, and the baseline
hazard function for

115
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,970
women might look like this, and that's
perfectly fine.

116
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,330
Because we are only canceling men with men
and

117
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,350
only women with women, so we're making no
assumptions that those baseline hazard

118
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,630
functions have any particular relationship
to one another.

119
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,490
Just to keep going on the likelihood I
think you're getting the idea now,

120
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,670
by time point 4 was a man so

121
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,240
I've determined that goes in the
likelihood we will only have men.

122
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,390
There were 3 men at risk, the 55-year-old,
the 60-year-old, and

123
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:29,140
the 50-year-old, and again we can cancel
out the baseline hazards, but

124
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,150
make no assumption about the relationship
between the baseline hazards for men and

125
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,500
the baseline hazards for women.

126
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,750
Now notice, when we set up the likelihood
in this way,

127
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,750
there's a couple of important things.

128
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,900
So first of all, I only have a beta for
age that I'm estimating.

129
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,730
I am not estimating any beta for gender,
because I am never comparing men and

130
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,170
women, so I can't say what the effect of
gender is here.

131
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,530
However, that's fine if I don't care about
the effect of gender, but

132
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,980
I want to adjust for it, and

133
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,550
make no assumption about proportional
hazards, this is the way to do it.

134
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,720
Something else to note, the other
assumption that I'm making here is,

135
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,280
I'm essentially, what I'm doing is,
there's a single beta.

136
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,120
I am using the same beta in the terms for
men as I am using in the terms for women.

137
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,100
So what I'm essentially doing is
calculating a weighted average of

138
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,240
the betas, weighted, you know, there's a
beta for men and a beta for women.

139
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,050
I'm assuming those betas are the same, and

140
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,690
I'm sort of calculating an average beta
across men and women.

141
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,520
The only potential issue there is that I'm
assuming that there is

142
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,920
no interaction between age and gender
here, so

143
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,060
that's something that I'd want to test
before I stratified on gender.

144
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,450
Because obviously I'm, making that
assumption.

145
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,860
I'm just averaging over men and women
here.

146
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,850
So that's the general idea of
stratification again.

147
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,140
It's great for nuisance variables, like if
you've done a multi-site study, and you

148
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,030
need to adjust for the fact that different
sites might be slightly different.

149
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,390
But you don't really care about the effect
of sight, it would be perfectly

150
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,500
reasonable to stratify on site, rather
than putting it in the model.

151
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,230
And just a few notes on stratification.

152
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,580
Again, different strata are allowed to
have different baseline hazard functions,

153
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,800
and there's no assumption.

154
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,410
That those hazard functions are parallel
between different strata.

155
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,050
So that's the, the neat trick here.

156
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,020
Essentially we're, what we get out at the
end of the day is a weighted hazard ratio.

157
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,770
It's been weighted over the different
strata, weighted over men and women.

158
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,490
So again, we're assuming there's no
interaction between,

159
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,500
the stratification variable and the
covariants we.

160
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,140
That we care about.

161
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,440
Again, it's very useful for

162
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,510
nuisance confounders where you don't want
to estimate the effect because your,

163
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,440
you lose the ability to estimate the
effect if you stratify on it.

164
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,420
And again it assumes no interaction
between the stratification variable and

165
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,290
the main predictors.

166
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,420
So, you'd want to make sure that you
tested that from the outset.
