1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,005
The correct answer for this is D.

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:08,352
Quantity distribution, we are not
guaranteed that 95% of the area will fall

3
00:00:08,352 --> 00:00:12,354
within 2 standard deviations of the mean,
even though this is,

4
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:18,955
a fact the normal distribution, this
include for the T-distribution.

5
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:22,510
Especially for when we have a small number
of observations.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:30,370
The answer is true because the researchers
measured virtually the entire population.

7
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:39,950
We can safely say this is a true value and
there is No sample statistic involved.

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,910
So the correct answer is B, the standard
error is a measure of variability of

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,930
a sample statistic, A is incorrect because
of formula given in A is valid only for

10
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,040
a standard error of a mean.

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,190
But we could have standard errors of a lot
of other statistics as well.

12
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,096
For example we could have standard errors
for more, mores and medians, and

13
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:04,548
the formula for that will not be the
formula given in A.

14
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:08,769
The formula for the standard error in a
mean is the standard deviation divided by

15
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,856
the square root of the number of
observations In this case,

16
00:01:11,856 --> 00:01:15,464
our standard deviation is 10.

17
00:01:15,464 --> 00:01:17,880
We have 400 observation.

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,310
We see that the standard error comes out
to be 0.5.

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,062
The correct answer for this question is B,
the size of the smallest group, and

20
00:01:26,062 --> 00:01:29,480
we can illustrate that using a very simple
example.

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:37,930
Let's say we had a case where A was 1, B
was 10, C was 100, and D was 1000.

22
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:43,034
We can see that the full expressions in
the formula come out to be 1 by 1,

23
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:47,780
less 0.1, less 0.01, less 0.001.

24
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,600
And we can see that the first expression
is the one that is going to impact

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,770
the standard error the most.

26
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,978
The correct answer here is D,

27
00:01:54,978 --> 00:02:01,520
different statistics have different
formulas for standard errors.

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,990
We know that the standard, the formula for

29
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,594
standard error of the mean It's given by
the standard deviation divided by

30
00:02:05,594 --> 00:02:07,316
the square root of the number of
observations but

31
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:11,260
this is only the formula for the standard
error of the mean.

32
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,331
We have very different formula for the
standard errors of the mean, the mode and

33
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,700
the median, for example.

34
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,770
The answer to this question is D, all of
the above.

35
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,322
The confidence interval gives us
information about the effect size,

36
00:02:24,322 --> 00:02:26,880
the precision and the statistical
significance.

37
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,532
The correct answer is 8 changing from a 99
to a 95

38
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:34,772
percent confidence level because requiring
a high, low level of.

39
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:37,090
Confidence decreases the width of the
confidence interval.

40
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,820
And 95% confidence interval of

41
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:46,680
a mean will include the true population
mean 95% total time.

42
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,770
This is true by the definition of a
confidence interval.

43
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,462
If we sample both women and men together,
we would have a higher standard deviation

44
00:02:53,462 --> 00:02:59,610
of heights because we would expect the men
to be Taller than the women.

45
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,965
It's the only sample of women we would
expect the, the heights to be

46
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:08,180
closer together because of which the
standard deviation would be lower.

47
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,857
The first confidence interval would be
naver,

48
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,340
narrower because it involved a larger
sample size.

49
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,380
You know that the formula for the margin
of

50
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:27,332
error is 1 by the square root of the
number of observations.

51
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:33,870
It comes out to 4%.

52
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,960
In this case we know that the mean is 55%.

53
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,496
In the previous question we calculated out
when we

54
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:48,710
have 625 observations the margin of error
is 4%.

55
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,339
So if we want to find.

56
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,956
The lower and upper bound for

57
00:03:53,956 --> 00:04:00,630
a 95% confidence interval this would be
55% plus or minus 4%.

58
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,040
The lower bound would be 55% minus 4%
which is 51 and

59
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,450
the upper bound would be 55 percent plus
4%, which is 59%.

60
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,210
The correct answer is b.

61
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:20,320
Because the smaller standard error will
result in a smaller p-value.

62
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,730
The correct answer here is d.

63
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,830
There is not enough evidence to reject the
null hypothesis.

64
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,600
A is incorrect because we have [INAUDIBLE]
that the treatments differ.

65
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,200
But this is not equivalent to proving the
treatments are the same.

66
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,512
B is incorrect because we were not given
enough information about whether the drug

67
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:39,330
and the placebo improved the insomnia
symptoms.

68
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,593
C is incorrect because the high val-,

69
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:46,215
p value shows us that we cannot let the
null hypothesis.

70
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:47,910
[SOUND] In this question, the correct
answer is C.

71
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,808
There is only 2% chance that the observed
difference in cur rates could have

72
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:52,990
arisen if the drug had no effect.

73
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,520
This is by the definition of the p value.
