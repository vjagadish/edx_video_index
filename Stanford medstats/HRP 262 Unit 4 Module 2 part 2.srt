1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,280
I'm now going to have you practice
actually writing out

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,290
the likelihood when you have a time
changing predictor variable.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,420
And I've made up a little mock dataset
that's small enough that you

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,320
can write out the entire likelihood.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,180
So this dataset contains time-to-event,
the event here is death.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,550
So, this is time to death.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,710
Whether or not they die, died is one and
zero is censored.

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,230
And then it has a time changing predictor
of weight.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:32,230
So, weight was measured here at baseline,
three months, six months, and nine months.

10
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:36,930
And what I want you to do is to write out
the likelihood equation if you

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,640
are modeling a Cox regression where you
included weight as

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,940
a time changing predictor.

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,740
And so what that means is, for

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:49,050
example, the first term in the likelihood
happens when the first event happens.

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,560
So the first event occurs at two months
into the study.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,810
So at two months into the study when you
write that term and

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,410
a likelihood, you're going to incorporate
the weights that were last measured.

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,100
Well, at two months into this study the,
the last measured weight is the baseline

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,620
weight because we didn't update the
weights again until three months.

20
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,830
So, for that term in the likelihood you'll
be including the weight at baseline.

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,110
At eight months, when there's another
event at eight months, for

22
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,600
that event you're going to include into
the likelihood the last measured weight.

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,700
So, the last measured weight at

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,820
eight months was the measurement done at
six months.

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,860
So you'll be including the weights from
six months into that term of

26
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,720
the likelihood and so on.

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,330
There are three events here so there
should be three terms in the likelihood.

28
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,700
So now, I want you to pause the video and

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,520
actually try writing out that whole
likelihood on your own.

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,348
And then, when you're done, restart the
video and I'll walk you through it.

31
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:44,228
[BLANK_AUDIO]

32
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:49,660
All right, so hopefully you were able to
write that out without too much trouble.

33
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,150
It is a little cumbersome to write out the
whole thing.

34
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,920
Again, we are doing a Cox Regression Model
here where our only predictor in

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,700
the model is weight.

36
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,160
But weight here is a time changing
predictor.

37
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,890
Notice we're going to get one data for

38
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,520
weight, but it's going to be based on the
changing weight.

39
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,300
So, it's going to be interpreted as the
effect for your current or

40
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,740
your most recently measured weight.

41
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,745
How would you actually write the
likelihood out here?

42
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:17,135
While there are three events occurring at
two months, eight months and

43
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:21,090
ten months into the study, so our
likelihood will have three terms in it.

44
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,990
What I did to make the problem a little
easier was,

45
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,730
I reordered my observations here from the
lowest time to the highest time.

46
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,770
It just makes it simpler to find
everything when you're writing out

47
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,910
the likelihood.

48
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,160
So, the first term of the likelihood
occurs at two months.

49
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,390
Before two months we have somebody
censored, so they're no longer at risk.

50
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,270
So, the first term in the likelihood will
have in the denominator eight people,

51
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,270
the eight who are still at risk.

52
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,170
Because we're only two months into this
study,

53
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,220
the last measured weight is the baseline
weight so

54
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,940
we'll be using the baseline weight in this
term in the likelihood.

55
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,574
So the person who had the event weighed
240 pounds so

56
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:58,388
their risk, their hazard is e rate to beta
times 240.

57
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:02,630
Everybody else who's at risk gets a term
in the denominator here.

58
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,220
So, the person who had the event, of
course, was at risk.

59
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,090
And then everybody else.

60
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,920
So, we had somebody who weighed 110.

61
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,760
We had another person at 130, and 200 I'm
going to just run over the line here.

62
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,890
180, 140, and it's a little tedious to
write out,

63
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,540
but you can write it out without too much
trouble.

64
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,110
So hopefully you've got something like
that for your first term.

65
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,610
For the second term in the likelihood,

66
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,310
it's going to be a little easier because a
lot of things are going away.

67
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,560
We had some people being censored, so now
at eight months into the study,

68
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,660
when the next event occurs, we only have
five people at risk.

69
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,460
That'll make the term a little less
cumbersome.

70
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,340
The weight that we're going to use now
that

71
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,470
we're going to enter into the likelihood
is the weight from six months,

72
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,350
because that was the last weight measured
before eight months.

73
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,760
So, at six months into this study, the
person who had the event was 250 pounds,

74
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:05,850
and those at risk were 250, 240, 155.

75
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:13,290
145 and again, I'm going to run out of
room here, I'll just scroll over, and 180.

76
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:19,170
And then finally, we lose this subject
because they died.

77
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,130
Finally the, the last event time occurred
at ten months into this study, and

78
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,620
there were four people left at risk.

79
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,400
Now there's actually two ways you could
have set this up,

80
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,340
because I had two people at ten.

81
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,430
I had one who is censored at ten and one
who had the event at ten.

82
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,600
And I have got their time as exactly the
same because I rounded the months here.

83
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,390
If you were to put that into SAS, SAS will
count the one who is censored,

84
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,760
the censoring as having at, happened after
the event.

85
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,730
So that censored person would be at risk
at ten months.

86
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,020
So we're going to say that they're at risk
at ten months.

87
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,620
If you did it the other way and, and
dropped them, that's fine too.

88
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,430
You kind of have to know how the algorithm
in the computer is handling it.

89
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,420
But we're going to include the,

90
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,070
we're going to say they were at risk and
then they were censored at ten months.

91
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,030
So, they were at risk at ten months.

92
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,780
So, we're going to have in the numerator
here, now we're using the weights from

93
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,500
nine months into the study, because that
was the last measured weight.

94
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,920
The person who had the event was 280
pounds.

95
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,900
And those at risk.

96
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,290
There were four at risk with the following
weights.

97
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,173
[SOUND].

98
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:27,320
So that's what the complete likelihood
function would look like here.

99
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,530
We would then maximize this likelihood
function to get the beta that made

100
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,070
our data the most likely.

101
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,240
And just for fun, I actually went ahead
and

102
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,510
plugged these data into the computer and
actually solved for beta.

103
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,630
Now this is a really small dataset and so,

104
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,850
in fact, the estimates that I'm getting
here are really unstable.

105
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,070
But we can actually get a hazard ratio to
pop out out of the computer with some

106
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,900
warnings about convergence.

107
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,760
And just for fun, again, these are made up
data.

108
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,070
When I made these data up, I made it so
that I, you know,

109
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,570
as a person was dying that their last
measured weight was a little bit higher.

110
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:06,008
I tried to make the higher weights link to
time, somewhere near the time of death.

111
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:08,980
So, obviously we're expecting to get
something where

112
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,270
there's an association here.

113
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,760
So when I actually ran these in,

114
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,790
in the computer when I used weight as a
time-changing

115
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,350
variable corresponding to the likelihood
that we just wrote out there.

116
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,640
I got a hazard ratio of 8.8, and again
with all the caveats and

117
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,680
this being a very unstable, and very small
sample of made up data.

118
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,450
But you know, because I made up the data
for there to be a link there,

119
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,905
I got a very high hazard ratio.

120
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:33,260
Now, I then ran a model where I included
a,

121
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,580
vary a predictor, a weight predictor that
did not change over time.

122
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,790
So you could use, like, the baseline
weight here, or you could use, like,

123
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,300
their average weight over the entire time
we saw them.

124
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,870
When I used the baseline rate, I only got
a hazard ratio of 2.7 and

125
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,518
when I used the average weight I got a
hazard ratio of 1.2.

126
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:52,820
And these is, this is just to show you
that it can make a really big difference,

127
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,890
even with real data, if you actually allow
the predictor to change over time,

128
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,370
it can show when things are correlated in
time.

129
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,480
So, when your current weight, your most
recent weight is the thing that

130
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,360
matters in terms of mortality, that's
reflected better in the hazard rate

131
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,300
when time weight was modeled as a
time-changing predictor.
