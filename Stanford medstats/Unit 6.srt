1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,930
In this next scenario, there are a number
of unlabeled syringes at

2
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,370
the procedure table filled with different
medication.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,210
The doctor involved planned on giving the
patient the pre-operative

4
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,370
antibiotic to reduce the chances of
surgical site infection post-operative.

5
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:34,140
And this requirement is a hospital quality
initiative and

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,500
actually reported into CMS and Joint
Commission as a quality metric.

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:47,494
The patient, which originally was having a
great conversation with the doctor,

8
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:51,340
was no longer responsive to verbal
commands.

9
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:58,275
That's the physician noticed that the
patient did not appear to be spontaneously

10
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:04,860
breathing or breathing on their own, and
certainly the patient was not moving.

11
00:01:05,884 --> 00:01:11,767
Patient's eyes were open, but there was no
blink reflex, and

12
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:19,370
the monitor started to go off, indicating
oxygenation was starting to go down.

13
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,530
Originally, the doctor thought this was an
anaphylactic reaction and

14
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,690
administered medication to respond to this
suspected allergic reaction.

15
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,610
He even had to manually ventilate the
patient for a period of time.

16
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:39,920
And over the 20 minutes the patient
gradually started to breathe on their own.

17
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,950
But you're probably thinking, well, what
do you think happened if you're the chief

18
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:52,210
quality officer or the chief medical
officer in terms of doing the review.

19
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:57,180
As I mentioned earlier, there were
multiple factors that were going on in

20
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,040
this particular event including unlabeled
syringes.

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,508
Because, is there a possibility that,

22
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:12,220
because there are multiple medications
with multiple syringes,

23
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,980
that the wrong medication was accidentally
given to the patient.

24
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,030
Is it possible there was fatigue?

25
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,918
Distraction, once again production
pressure environmental issue,

26
00:02:26,918 --> 00:02:28,560
lighting, noise.

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,722
It's not uncommon some surgeons have a
preference for

28
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:37,638
loud music that make the surgeon more
comfortable or

29
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:43,423
more in sync with what's going on, but it
could be distracting to other folks

30
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:50,770
involved in the procedures where there are
potential variations and work processes.

31
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,970
Issues in staff communication, staff
training, teamwork and culture.

32
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:03,244
What was learned from this particular
experience, and it turned out the patient

33
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:09,620
did receive a paralytic agent, because the
patient's muscle was paralyzed.

34
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,160
We all know what was completely
operational,

35
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,630
functional, was the patient's brain.

36
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,780
And, specifically cranial nerve number
eight was totally operational.

37
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,250
And, the patient heard everything that
occurred during the moments,

38
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,150
the time period that the patient was
paralyzed.

39
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,660
And in the debriefing, with the patient,
the patient was basically able to describe

40
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,929
what would be considered a paralytic agent
and not an anaphylactic reaction.

41
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,034
What had happened in this particular case
the patient postponed the surgery; they

42
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:50,522
actually came back the following day to
have the procedure done, and there was no

43
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,812
untoward [UNKNOWN] associated with the
event, other than a lot of time and

44
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:59,564
energy taken up by risk management, the
quality department, the physician that was

45
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:05,040
involved, and administration to draw down
the to figure out why it happened.

46
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,513
And in a nutshell, turned out that because
the syringes were not labeled,

47
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:13,418
it was possible that the doctor picked up
the wrong medication and

48
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:17,700
administered it and thereby, creating an
adverse event.

49
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,392
Some of the additional lesson learned was
actually reviewing

50
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:26,007
Joint Commission's National Patient Safety
Goal, which requires that any

51
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:30,551
time that medication is put into a
secondary container, such as a syringe or

52
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:34,669
a basin, it needs to be labeled with its
contents if the medication is

53
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:37,899
not immediately administered into the
patient.

54
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,082
You know, some of you are probably
thinking, well, you know,

55
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:45,010
if I have to label everything that I'm
giving immediately to a patient,

56
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,220
that's going to seriously affect workflow.

57
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,778
No.
The expectation is,

58
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:51,334
is that if you're drawing up medication or

59
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:55,878
using medication out of a container and
directly putting it into a patient,

60
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,970
administering a patient, without a break
in the process.

61
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,950
You know, like putting the syringe down or

62
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,210
going to the computer, doing
documentation.

63
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,684
Or doing something else,

64
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:10,441
prior to administering the medication, you
do not have to be labeling the syringe or

65
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:13,550
the container per Joint Commissioner
requirement.

66
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,220
The other issue is that distraction has
been know to be a significant factor in

67
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,790
medication errors.

68
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,910
Now, for the most part in most hospital
organizations,

69
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,690
the individuals are providing the most
medications are going to be the nurses

70
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,990
because they're going to be involved with
doing a fair amount of administration.

71
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,888
But we do know for a fact that many times
the physician, house staff,

72
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:41,549
you know, are involved with administering
medication to patients,

73
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,420
especially injectable medication.

74
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,043
As well as potentially on occasion PO
medication,

75
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:50,642
you really do need to make sure you have a
double check system in place to

76
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:54,020
make sure the right patient's getting the
right medication.

77
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,966
As I mentioned earlier some of the
prevention strategies include

78
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:04,628
immediately administered medication does
not require to be labeled, but

79
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:07,588
if you do label it, because there's going
to be

80
00:06:07,588 --> 00:06:12,546
a break in the process between the moment
the medication is drawn up prepared and

81
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:17,870
giving the patient, it really does need to
be labeled with some key information.

82
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,782
The key information you may want to double
check with your hospital policy and

83
00:06:23,782 --> 00:06:28,202
procedure, but at a minimum, it should
include the name of the medication,

84
00:06:28,202 --> 00:06:32,418
the concentration if there's a
concentration, preparation date, and

85
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:35,070
then the, any expiration date that needs
to be

86
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,360
put on if it's not going to be
administered immediately.

87
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,750
Labeling should be legible and visible.

88
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,598
So it's not very helpful if you put a
label on, and you can't actually read it.

89
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:49,595
If there is any doubt about the medication
or

90
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:54,262
the container, consider doing the
preparation process over.

91
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:59,153
Emergencies and urgency situation usually
creates the variation in process,

92
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:04,263
Joint Commission does recognize that, you
know, patient care comes first; that

93
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:08,720
sometimes in those situations you do need
to expedite things.

94
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,544
But for the most part, you know, if it's
not an urgent administration situation and

95
00:07:13,544 --> 00:07:18,033
you're not sure about the medication or
the container in terms of what is in it,

96
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:22,690
you may want to consider disposing of it
and starting the process over.

97
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,710
Doing a double check of the label
container is a safety strategy that can

98
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,530
prevent bad outcome.

99
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,250
And of course, that's assuming that you
pulled the original medication,

100
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,600
was exactly what you needed to administer.

101
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,577
We've had situations in many organizations
where because the stocking of

102
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:47,265
the automatic automated dispensing
machines that holds medication that,

103
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:51,294
if they're not stocked right, it's
possible that someone

104
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:56,192
inadvertently stocked the medication wrong
in that particular drawer or

105
00:07:56,192 --> 00:08:01,880
pocket, and even though you pulled it out
of a pocket that said one thing.

106
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,120
Assuming it was that particular
medication,

107
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,600
it turned out it might be another thing.

108
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,190
So, double checking the label the
medication to

109
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,220
make sure you're dealing with what it is
that you want to use in your patient.

110
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,799
