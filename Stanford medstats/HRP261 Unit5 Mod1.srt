[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,150
In this next module,

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,870
I'm going to talk about how to
standardize, your continuous variables.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,850
That is, to translate them into standard
deviation units, or

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,940
Z scores, prior to putting them, in your
regression model.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,210
So, when you're doing a regression model,
you get a beta coefficient and

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,850
those beta coefficients are slopes.

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:31,610
So, of course, slopes are going to depend,
on the units that you choose for x and y.

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,800
For example, if you were to put weight, in
the model as.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,550
Pounds, you're going to get a different
beta coefficient, a different slope, than,

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,240
if you put, weight in the model as
kilograms.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,560
Now, mathematically, there's really no
difference here,

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,500
you're going to get exactly, the same P
values for those 2 beta coefficients.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,430
So, it really, doesn't matter which units
you choose however,

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,450
in terms of the message,

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,850
that you report to your reader, the betas
are going to look differently.

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,870
One is going to look bigger than the
other, and

18
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,830
that might make a different impression on
your reader, so

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,220
you have to be a little bit careful, about
unit choice.

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,810
For logistic regressions specifically,

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,630
the magnitude of the odds ratio is
going to depend, on the units.

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,190
So, let's say we have a data set where we
have age measured in years, and

23
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,700
I throw that into my logistic regression
model.

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,270
I come out, with a beta for age of .1.

25
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,610
And let's say that's indeed, a
statistically significant effect.

26
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,860
I might, then report the odds ratio for,
a, one year increase.

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,140
That's what my computer program's,

28
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,180
probably automatically going to calculate
for me.

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,960
I exponentiation the beta of .1, I get an
odds ratio of 1.11.

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,620
Again, that's statistically significant.

31
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,740
But, that odds ratio looks kind of small,
right?

32
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,260
It doesn't ,look very impressive.

33
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,420
That 1.11 and 11 percent increase in your
odds of the outcome here,

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,120
well that's small,

35
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,620
because, a one year jump in age is also a
small jump in the predictor variable.

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,540
It's a small unit, however, I might choose
to instead,

37
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,240
talk about a report ratio for a ten year
increase in age.

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,510
So, how would I calculate that?

39
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,220
It's very easy, to do, I'm just going to
take my beta coefficient and

40
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,310
multiply it by ten before exponentiating.

41
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,990
Well, then you see, it come out with an
odds ratio of 2.7.

42
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,390
Well that looks much more impressive.

43
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,670
Now that, P value, for this last ratio is
exactly the same, nothing has really,

44
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,890
changed here.

45
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,140
Except that, the message that you convey
to your readers is a little bit different.

46
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,320
Because, of 2.71 jump is going to grab the
attention of your reader.

47
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,255
A little bit more than a 1.11 odds ratio.

48
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:32,300
So, the trace of units is a little bit
arbitrary and to get around this issue.

49
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,640
What, sometimes, we'll do and which,
often, is a good idea to do.

50
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,050
Is to standardize, their variables, before
putting them into the regression model and

51
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,490
typically ,that means, translating our
variable into Z-scores.

52
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,897
So, what are Z-scores?

53
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:49,580
Z-scores are just standard deviation
units.

54
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,300
You can calculate them, very easily.

55
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,210
All you do, is you take an observations,
value, you subtract the mean and

56
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,100
divide by the standard deviation.

57
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,890
That will give you standard deviation
units, rather than the original.

58
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,580
Units, so instead of kilograms per meters
squared, you'll have Z scores, or

59
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,210
standard deviations of BMI.

60
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,670
This is nice, because, then all the
variables are sort of comparable to

61
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,300
one another, because, they're all talking
about, they're all in standard deviation.

62
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,190
How do we actually accomplish this against
very simple, I'm assuming,

63
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,890
all of you have had to calculate Z scores
before.

64
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,850
But, you take, to calculate Z score,

65
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,950
you take a particular observation, you
subtract from the mean of your sample, and

66
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,070
you divide by the standard deviation of
your sample for that particular, variable.

67
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,908
This is best to illustrate this with an
actual example.

68
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:37,140
I'm, going to ,be talking, a lot this week
about a particular data set,

69
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,550
that I worked on, for some sports
medicine, physicians.

70
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,110
And one of the variables, that was in that
data set was fat mass.

71
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,200
And so we were interested in bone density
and

72
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,800
these were women and, male, young runners.

73
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,920
And sometimes, they will have bone density
issues.

74
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,690
So, these athletes were measured with dual
x-ray absorbtomotry, which gives you

75
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,160
your bone density, but it also gives you a
very precise measurement of fat mass.

76
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,980
So ,that's one of the variables we have in
the data set.

77
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,310
The mean, for this group, for

78
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,640
the women, for fat mass, was 31.4 pounds
worth of fat mass.

79
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,090
That's actually, very lean, because, this
is a very young and athletic group.

80
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,488
The standard deviation for the variable is
11.4 pounds, so

81
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,630
,just kind of randomly picking, a
particular observation from the data set,

82
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,650
one of the women had a Fat mass of 11.6
pounds, which is actually fairly low.

83
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,230
So, what would her z score be?

84
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,030
It's simple to calculate.

85
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,550
We know it's going to be negative.

86
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,400
We know it's going to be, a fair bit
negative, because,

87
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,910
she's quite low compared to the mean.

88
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,350
To calculate her precise z score, we take
her value 11.6 11.6,

89
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,620
subtract from, from that, the mean of the
sample which was 31.4,

90
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,350
divide by the standard deviation which was
11.4.

91
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,710
Her Z score is negative 1.74 meaning that
she's one and

92
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,050
three quarters of a standard deviation
below average.

93
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,430
On fat mass, now you're not going to have
to do too much of this,

94
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,130
by, hand because most computer packages,
statistical packages,

95
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,150
come, with an algorithm to do standard
devi, standardization for

96
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,610
you, so it's not like have to tell the
computer this is subtractive mean,

97
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,330
and you don't have to find the mean
standardization to do this.

98
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,340
The computer, will just do this
automatically.

99
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,860
Most, computer programs, it's the click of
a button or teeny piece of code.

100
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,990
So, for example, I said, I told the
computer to translate, fatmass,

101
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,420
my variable fatmass into, to standardize
it into z scores.

102
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,710
And it does, It did it automatically, I
didn't have to do any work.

103
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,030
I rounded the values, here, but, for
example, a fatmass of 26 turns,

104
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,630
out to be a z score of -.5.

105
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,500
This person's about ,a half standard
deviation below average.

106
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,010
And ,I get this for all of the
observations, in my data set.

107
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,803
Again, really simple you shouldn't, have
to do much work to get this.

108
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:53,113
This new variable, the z-scores of course,
will have a mean of 0 and

109
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:55,340
a standard deviation of 1.

110
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,860
And that's also nice, that's a nice
property.

111
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,440
All of your variables then, that you
standardize will have means of 0 and

112
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,430
standard deviations of 1.

113
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:08,070
Now ,why might you want to bother to go
through, this little extra step?

114
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,450
There's a couple of reasons, so one thing,
is standard deviation units,

115
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,130
are more, comparable than the original
units, units, so

116
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,830
it makes it a little bit easier to compare
effects across different predictors that

117
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,140
have different inherent units.

118
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,040
You can talk about the standard deviation
that your standard deviation of

119
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,940
caloric intake, your standard deviation of
bone density,

120
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,170
your standard deviation of BMI, and it
makes it a little bit easier,

121
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,440
to look at different data coefficients and
get some sense of how they compare.

122
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,200
You want to be careful, though, because,
some people think,

123
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,190
well ,if I've translated, everything into
standard deviation units,

124
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,970
then the beta with the highest number, is
therefore the most important variable.

125
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,890
And that may not quite be true.

126
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,190
Because, a standard deviation of age,
might mean something a little different,

127
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,550
than a standard deviation of BMI for
example.

128
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,750
So, it's more comparable, although not
completely comparable, compared with the,

129
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,750
original unit.

130
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,110
If you've got variables with arbitrary
units,

131
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,360
standard deviations, are really nice.

132
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,380
So, for example ,we might give people, a
depression questionnaire and

133
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,800
they get some score, on that
questionnaire.

134
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,300
You just put the score, into your
regression model.

135
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,360
You're going to get the betas, for, a one
unit increase in depression score.

136
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,170
But, what does that mean intuitively?

137
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,490
Nobody's really going to understand, what
it means to go up,

138
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,930
one point on that particular arbitrary
scale.

139
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,390
If you translate, it into standard
deviation units,

140
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,740
however, it has a lot more meaning,
because now, you can say what does it

141
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,470
mean to be a standard deviation, above
average in this population.

142
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,900
So, it's easier to interpret.

143
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,060
And then finally, it makes the intercept
more interpretable, as well.

144
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:47,300
So, the intercept of course, is the value,
in this case for the lougan, when all

145
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,460
the predictors, in your model that you've
included in your model are equal to zero.

146
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,190
If you've put into you model age and
weight and

147
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,780
things like this, what does it mean, to,
if you've set all of those to zero?

148
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,380
There is no person that exists.

149
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,770
That has an age of zero and a weight of
zero.

150
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,770
Right, so that intercept has no kind of
natural interpretation,

151
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,600
if you've got continuous predictors of the
model.

152
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,870
However, if you standardized ,all your
continuous predictors, the, a mean of

153
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:18,750
zero, a value of zero now means, you're at
the mean, for that variable in the sample.

154
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,190
So, now the intercept has some nice
natural interpretation.

155
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:25,580
It's the expected value for someone with
the mean, value of all the predictors.

156
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,748
So ,a little easier, to make sense of the
intercept.

157
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:33,080
[SOUND] I'm now going to show you, a
particular example.

158
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,450
And, this, example, again, comes from the
data,

159
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,980
that I was looking at, on bone mineral
density, in, young.

160
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,400
These are adolescent, runners, and

161
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,400
we have some data on girls, as well as,
boys, adolescents.

162
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,280
So, just I'm showing you, a subset of the
data.

163
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,330
This is from linear regression, just to
start with.

164
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,740
Just to show you that this also works, you
can, do this with a linear regression.

165
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,250
The outcome here, is the spine, bone
density, and whole body density.

166
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,100
Two places, we are interested, in the bone
density.

167
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,860
And, this, these bone density measurements
,are also in Z score, so

168
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,380
the outcome here is Z scores.

169
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,080
[LAUGH] The predictors are all Z scores.

170
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,150
Makes it fairly easy, to, interpret those
beta coefficients.

171
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,750
Then we have a number of different, body
measures: weight, height, BMI, lean mass

172
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,750
and fat mass, and android fat ratio, which
is a mark of visceral fat, all of those

173
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,490
come out of your decks, your dual X-ray,
other [UNKNOWN] bone density measurement.

174
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,950
Now, and, how do you interpret the beta
coefficients, that you see here?

175
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,436
So, I'm just going to, show you, one how
to interpret it.

176
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:36,770
So, this 0.24 here, this is the beta
coefficient, for a model,

177
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,850
in which spine Z score, is the outcome and
I had, these are all unit variant.

178
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,230
From univariate linear regression, so

179
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,070
it had a single predictor, weight, in
standard deviation units.

180
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,400
So, the way you interpret this 0.24 is
that for

181
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:55,900
every one standard deviation increase in
weight, spine, Z score goes up 0.24.

182
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,220
You get a,

183
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,480
about a quarter of a standard deviation
increase ,in your spine, bone density.

184
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,260
So, that has a nice easy, interpretation
and, it makes it easier to compare,

185
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,430
across different predictors, as well as
across different bone density sites,

186
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,930
as well as across different genders.

187
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:19,260
And again, you can't, assume that the
comparison is absolute, here, but

188
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,040
it gives you a sense of which of these
body measures is

189
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,900
more strongly related to bone density, at
which site, and in which gender.

190
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,500
And, you can see that, so for example, the
point for one,

191
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,320
is the highest beta coefficient and women
here had point four one so

192
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,300
for weight as the predictor in whole body,
bone density ,as the outcome.

193
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,710
So, that gives you a sense that weight,

194
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,810
is really important, in terms of your
whole body bone density.

195
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,330
If you look at spine.

196
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,910
For the spine, it looks like, you're,
actually your visceral fat, having more

197
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,710
visceral fat, was actually fairly good for
the spine, for both, men and women.

198
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,030
You get a higher coefficient there, out of
all those, predictors.

199
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,640
It's also interesting just to note,

200
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,610
that there are differences, between men
and women.

201
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,740
Also the P values, tend to be very, easy
to predict, because,

202
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,860
you can see that as long as, for women,
where N is 90 1 as long as you were 2 or

203
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,495
below, the P value was definitely, a was
point at the10 level you had to get above

204
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:28,916
.2 to hit that .05 level and then when you
got above .25 you hit the.

205
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,040
0.005 level.

206
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,300
So, there's kind of a natural progression
here,

207
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,410
again, it's a little bit more comparable.

208
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,830
You can kind of compare across and

209
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:41,190
they naturally, become significant at a
certain level, depending on the end.

210
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,690
So, all of that makes this just a little
easier, to, interpret.

211
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,080
And, just to show you an example, from
logistic regression as well,.

212
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,920
So, I threw those same body measurements,
into a model,

213
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,570
where my outcome now is stress fractures,
and if you have lower bone density, then,

214
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,130
you're more likely to fracture.

215
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,960
So, all of those body measures which were
tied with

216
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,020
higher bone density are tied with a lower
risk or lower odds of stress fractures.

217
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,100
Interestingly, the one that has the
strongest odd ratio is fat mass.

218
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,670
This is just looking at women now, not in
the men.

219
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,090
But, in women, having a higher fat mass, a
one standard deviation increase in

220
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:20,010
fat mass, was associated with about 64%,
decrease in the odds of stress fracture.

221
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,900
Notice, that, that's the biggest odd ratio
or

222
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:28,100
the most protective and the reason that,
is, probably is that in this.

223
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,500
Population of women runners, they tend to
get, menstrual irregularities,

224
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,660
Amenorrhoea, and that's linked to low bone
density.

225
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,240
Low bone density is linked to fracture.

226
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,120
So ,having more fat, actually incre,

227
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,620
increases your chances of having a normal
period, which increases your bone density,

228
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,360
which, you know, makes you protected
against fractures.

229
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,760
But these standard deviation units, again,

230
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,930
make these odds ratios very easy to
interpret.

231
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,760
I just want to point out, one thing, just
a clarification.

232
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,950
When we're talking about z scores,

233
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,120
everybody thinks about the standard normal
curve, so you automatically,

234
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,550
start thinking about normality, that your
variables must be normally distributed,

235
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,340
but z standardization, is not the same
thing,

236
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,150
as making a variable normally distributed,
so, if you just ,subtract the mean and

237
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,210
divide by the standard deviation, of a
variable, if that variable started out as

238
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,490
a non-normal variable, as a skewed
variable, it will remain non-normal.

239
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,100
It doesn't magically, become normal, just,
because you done a z-standardization.

240
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,064
Of course, if the original value was
normally distributed,

241
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:29,857
then the z-score will also be normally
distributed, but

242
00:13:29,857 --> 00:13:34,075
that's not a guarantee, so don't assume
,just because you've standardized ,that

243
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:37,497
your variable is then normally
distributed, because it may not be.

244
00:13:37,497 --> 00:13:42,260
