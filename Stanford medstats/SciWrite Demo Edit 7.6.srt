2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,890
In this next module, I'm going to edit a
student's essay from a previous course.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,440
This will give you a sense of how I would
approach editing an entire essay.

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:19,970
Take a minute now and pause the video and
read the entire essay.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,320
I've also provided a text file if you
want to read it there.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,830
If you have time, try to edit it on your
own.

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,710
And then restart the video and I'll walk
you through how I would approach the edit.

00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,290

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,560
So this essay deals with a really great
topic a phobia of dentists.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,360
I didn't realize that there was a formal
phobia of dentistry.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,050
It's called odontophobia.

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,410
But great topic, really draws the reader
in.

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,710
I, I was interested to read about this.

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,790
The main thing that I'm going to suggest
for

15
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,420
this author, the one thing that this essay
needs a little work on is that,

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,810
I'm not entirely sure what the main point
of this essay is.

17
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,500
The author is going to need to add a
paragraph,

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,470
probably right after the first paragraph
that tells the reader

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,960
exactly what they're trying to accomplish
in this essay.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,290
What is the point of this essay?

21
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,670
And I can make some guesses about it,

22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,170
but it's unclear if it's about the paper,
the treatments, is it advice for

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,280
dentists, it's a little unclear exactly
what the goal of this essay is.

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,370
So the author will need to add a paragraph
here to to bring that out.

25
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,210
And I'm going to make a guess about what
their intention might here,

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,970
be here but just for the purposes of
illustration.

27
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,300
The other thing is I'm going to reorganize
this essay a little bit.

28
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,250
Because I'm not entirely sure what the,
the main point of this essay is

29
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,500
the organize strikes me as needing a
little bit of reorganization to make the,

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,420
the, flow, and of course the exact flow
and

31
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,230
organization will depend on what the main
point of the essay is.

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,950
Other than that though, language is fairly
easy to understand.

33
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,810
I didn't have any trouble understanding
this, so that's what I'm mainly going to

34
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,820
rearrange, I'm going to, make a few
changes here and there to

35
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,060
improve the language, but mostly just
going to deal with organization and focus.

36
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,655
So, starting with the beginning,

37
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:05,650
60% of the world's population is afraid
somehow to go to the dentist.

38
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,290
I'm not sure that we need to be so exact
here.

39
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,800
I'm not sure where this 60% comes from.

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,470
So, maybe we can just say what everybody
knows to be true,

41
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,340
which is most people are afraid to go to
the dentist.

42
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,720
We don't need the word somehow, of course,
here.

43
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,960
Most people are afraid to go to the
dentist.

44
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,968
Perhaps we don't have to give the exact
statistic here because I'm a little

45
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:26,529
skeptical about where that came from.

46
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:33,480
But, 15 to 20% and maybe we say exactly 15
to 20% of whom?

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,980
I'm going to say, maybe adults worldwide.

48
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,030
I get the sense that this is a worldwide
focus here, so

49
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,320
maybe 15 to 20% of adults worldwide suffer
a more severe fear.

50
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,108
[SOUND].

51
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:52,768
Colon, it's getting used to the colon,
odontophobia.

52
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:56,790
And, you of course, are giving an exact
statistic here, this 15 to 20%.

53
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,840
We're going to need a reference to say
where that came from.

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,220
Perhaps that came from the World for

55
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,900
Health Organization, which is mentioned in
the next sentence, but it's unclear, so

56
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,510
we actually need the reference right there
for that particular statistic.

57
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,330
Actually going to delete this next
sentence about

58
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,440
the World Health Organization recognize it
as this severe fear.

59
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,780
I've already said what it is, that it's a
severe fear in the first sentence,

60
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,080
I don't think we need a second, a separate
sentence for that.

61
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,630
The main thing that the author is trying
to achieve in this first paragraph,

62
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,840
I think, is to differentiate for the
reader, which is very important,

63
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,130
what's the difference between just having
a normal fear of the dentist and

64
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,630
having odontophobia, which is as more so
your fear?

65
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,460
What's that what's the line between those
two things, and

66
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,400
I think the other's done a good job of, of
giving us some sense of why those two

67
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,140
things are different and how odontophobia
maybe is even diagnosed.

68
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,160
They may, the author may want to give a
little bit more if there's some diagnostic

69
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:53,000
criteria or something but I think I would
probably just recommend moving the

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,310
sentence about the symptoms to right after
the first line, because they mentioned,

71
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,070
you know, most people are afraid, but some
people have a more severe fear.

72
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,203
Maybe just describe right there what that
more severe fear looks like, so

73
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,190
this is kind of a list of a lot of medical
jargon so

74
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,680
I am also going to eliminate some of that
medical jargon.

75
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,200
So maybe we say sufferers just jump right
in to what they experience.

76
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,207
Sufferers may instead of hyperventilation,

77
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:22,716
let's make this into a verb,
hyperventilate.

78
00:04:22,716 --> 00:04:29,492
They may hyperventilate tachycardia
hypertension sudden drop in blood pressure

79
00:04:29,492 --> 00:04:35,916
some of those are medical jargon, so let's
change all of that to may hyperventilate,

80
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:40,850
experience sudden changes in heart rate
and blood pressure.

81
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,485
Transpiration is just sweating, so let's
say, just say sweat.

82
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:52,860
And I'm just going to truncate this and
say and vomit.

83
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,380
Cypher sufferers may hyperventilate,

84
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,290
experience sudden changes in heart rate
and blood pressure, sweat, and vomit.

85
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,040
Or, or vomit.

86
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,040
We should probably put, because they may
not experience all of these symptoms, or

87
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,220
vomit with just thinking about the
dentist's chair.

88
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,600
And then, I might move the words sweat up
here because this is kind of

89
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,970
a long description, experience sudden
changes so

90
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,040
it flows a little better if we put
hyperventilate, sweat, and then this

91
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,160
kind of longer description, or vomit when
just thinking about the dentist chair.

92
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,710
I don't think we need to, to be, list all
of the symptoms here, I think we just need

93
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,160
to give enough to give the reader a sense
of that this is pretty severe.

94
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,493
Then because we referred here to
sufferers,

95
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:38,786
we can say instead of this fear often
leaves people, we can just say they avoid,

96
00:05:38,786 --> 00:05:43,466
the sufferers which we referred to in the
last sentence, they avoid.

97
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:47,500
So this is another thing that
distinguishes odontophobia from people who

98
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,336
just have kind of a normal fear of the
dentist, the people who have it,

99
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:55,580
actually avoid going to the dentist until
emergencies happen.

100
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,690
I changed this to until,

101
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,180
until it's an emergency, although I can go
either way on that one.

102
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,410
And then at which time, I changed this to
at which

103
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:11,240
time they may require invasive treatments.

104
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,450
This should be a that instead of a which,

105
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,560
invasive treatments that reinforce, I
don't think we need the can there.

106
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,520
That reinforce and then we don't need to
repeat fear of dentistry.

107
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,570
We could just say that reinforced their
phobia.

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,060
And I even added the word traumatic in
here so, I don't know if that's necessary

109
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,710
but they avoid going to the dentist until
it's an emergency at which time they may,

110
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,640
may require traumatic invasive treatments
that can reinforce their phobia.

111
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,340
So that first paragraph gives us a nice
summary of what odontophobia is,

112
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,850
what it looks like.

113
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,380
And then in this next paragraph, I'm
actually going to add a paragraph here

114
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,770
because I feel like I need to know where
this essay is going.

115
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,500
So we've got the description of
odontophobia but

116
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,430
what's the point of this essay?

117
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,800
Is it to describe new treatments for
Odontophobia, is it to give advice for

118
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,370
dentists, I'm going to just put something
in here,

119
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,290
which I think could be the focus, I'm not
sure.

120
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,870
Maybe something like, fortunately dentists
have many options,

121
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,230
because this seems to be going through a
litany of different treatment options,

122
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:23,630
have many options for treating and
managing their patients with odontophobia.

123
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,500
I'm a little bit targeting this essay as
if it's, you know,

124
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,530
targeted towards dentists.

125
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,790
The other doesn't have to do that.

126
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,630
If that wasn't their intent it would be
very easy to,

127
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,520
to take out the dentist part here.

128
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,980
But that's what I thought maybe they are,
they were trying to do here.

129
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,650
And I think what's really interesting and
what the others spent the most time

130
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,420
on here is they talk about all these kind
of simple, low cost interventions that you

131
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,234
can do instead of like having to go to a
psychotherapist or

132
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,768
take drugs, so I think that maybe that's
the main focus, the main point here.

133
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:58,320
So I'm going to say besides a conventional
therapy, so the author here had refer,

134
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,280
refered to behavior and pharmacological,
pharmacological approaches,

135
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,759
I'm going to call that behid, beside
conventional treatments.

136
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,440
Call that treatments because I'm going to
use therapies in the next second here, and

137
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,450
then in, in, set off with dashes which
includes, you know,

138
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,970
behavioral therapy, that's your,, your
typical psycho,

139
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,950
that's psychological therapy, behavioral
therapy and drugs.

140
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:29,602
So I'm just putting those examples in
dashes some surprisingly

141
00:08:29,602 --> 00:08:35,463
simple, no cost intervention may also be
quite effective.

142
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:45,463
[SOUND].

143
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:50,846
So I'm just making a note to the author
that they need to clearly state the main

144
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:53,774
point of the essay here and if I haven't
got it quite right they may want to

145
00:08:53,774 --> 00:08:56,126
treat this a little bit, but I think that
the idea is that,

146
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:59,152
besides conventional treatments, there's
some surprisingly simple,

147
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:02,900
low cost interventions out there that
might be an, quite effective as well.

148
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,670
The one that struck me was this idea of
pumping the smell of coffee and

149
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,850
fresh bread through the dentist's office.

150
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,740
That seems like a great idea.

151
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,860
So that's a, you know, a simple and low
cost.

152
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,020
So this next paragraph that in terms of
organization, I'm going to make the next

153
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,600
paragraph just be about a whole bunch of
simple things that the dentist can do to

154
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,770
improve their office to make it more
friendly for these types of patients.

155
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,590
So I've already kind of said,
pharmological and

156
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,770
behaviorals, get rid of that.

157
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,960
The next sentence talks about the
sensorial stimuli, and

158
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,500
the sentence after that talks about the
sensorial stimuli, so

159
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,460
I thought we could combine those two
sentences.

160
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,590
This sentence here is just a description
of the types of

161
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,330
sensorial stimuli that you can use, so I'm
going to start with a recent study from

162
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,650
the National Italian Union of Dental
Industry, showed that sensorial stimuli,

163
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:53,150
and let me give you some examples here,
with using, setting this off with dashes.

164
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,778
So those would include things like the
pleasant smells, so sensorial stimuli, so

165
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:00,435
pleasant odors, like fresh bread or

166
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:03,930
coffee, warm colors of the place, we don't
need of the place, just warm colors.

167
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,300
Pleasant music, or beautiful paintings on
the walls.

168
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,110
So those are all the examples, and then,
getting back the dash here.

169
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,940
And then we get our decisive from the
psychological perspective of

170
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,690
the patient and can be preferable than the
use of anti, these are anxialytics or

171
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,340
anti anxiety drugs.

172
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,740
I think we can say there's a little bit
more crisply, so maybe just our work

173
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:33,090
as well, work as well as anti-anxiety
drugs, for many patients,

174
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,720
I don't know if that's true, I'm assuming
that this study kind of talked about the,

175
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,430
the effectiveness of these, if we, if
they, if that's even been ever researched.

176
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,570
So I'm just kind of guessing here, but

177
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,995
maybe they work as well as anti-anxiety
drugs for many patients or

178
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:48,960
maybe patients prefer them or it, give
something about exactly what

179
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,550
the study tells us about the effectiveness
of this, of these stimuli.

180
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,850
Then we get a list of drugs, I,

181
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,750
since I'm going to make this paragraph
about the simple non-drug interventions,

182
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,790
I'm going to move the drug list down to a
lower paragraph.

183
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,690
I'll get back to the drugs in a few
minutes here.

184
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,750
This next paragraph is about, again,

185
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,990
simple steps the dentist can take in the
dentist office.

186
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,460
So I think we can fold this next paragraph
right here into the,

187
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,910
to the previous paragraph.

188
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,150
They're still talking about that same
Italian study.

189
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:21,670
The study concluded that, so I think it's
fair to kind of put this all into one.

190
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:27,620
So, I'm going to start with Dentist's, and

191
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,893
also ease patient's fears by,

192
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:38,730
and then they had this, the author had a
nice colon here followed by a list.

193
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,250
I think we'll just stick with that.

194
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,680
So I'm just going to introduce this list
very directly.

195
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,140
This is our other simple steps the dentist
can take.

196
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:52,370
Can also ease patient's fears by, now I
need, like, ing verbs, gerunds.

197
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,300
So I'm going to change this to by
transmitting by telling and

198
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,460
showing, by offering it, and we have to
make sure that we

199
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,820
keep this parallel advice starting each of
these items with an ing verb.

200
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
So transmitting serenity and friendliness,

201
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,960
I don't think we need by taking the time
just to chat with a patient.

202
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,280
I think we can, that's just extra.

203
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,360
By telling and showing, I think we can
just make that a little bit shorter by

204
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,650
saying by explaining what is going to be
done.

205
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:20,490
Offering earphones to isolate them from
external sound and at the same time

206
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,674
provide music therapy, and we can just
say, and provide music therapy.

207
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:25,900
It's doing both at once.

208
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,520
adjusting.

209
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,090
Look, I'm making these all ing verbs to be
parallel.

210
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,290
Adjusting the chair to the patient
dimensions.

211
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,820
I, I think that probably the point of that
is to improve comfort.

212
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,810
So I might be, just say what the point of
adjusting the chairs,

213
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,160
adjusting the chair to improve comfo,
fort, providing an image.

214
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,320
How about projecting an image rather than
providing,

215
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,860
just a slightly better verb there,
projecting an image of quality.

216
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,899
And professional and feed, de, demeter,
[SOUND] and

217
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:54,850
offering a well illuminated place with
plenty of space and,

218
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,920
again, this last item here is the drug, so
I'm going to pop out drugs later.

219
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,615
So now I get one paragraph that has all of
these different simple interventions that

220
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,692
the dentist can do right at the dental
office.

221
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:06,963
If you scroll down for

222
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:11,621
a minute to the very last paragraph, the
author brings up a, a new idea right in

223
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:15,970
the last paragraph about the idea of
internet based treatments.

224
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,070
And it seems to be a potentially low cost,
simple intervention, so

225
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,890
I'm actually going to move this whole idea
up about the internet based treatment and

226
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,730
delete it from the last paragraph, and
give it its own paragraph

227
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,245
following along this theme of low cost,
simple interventions.

228
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:38,880
So, researchers are also studying, so

229
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,670
are now focusing on, I think that you
could say are,

230
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:47,430
also studying, the use of internet based
treatments.

231
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,720
I don't think we need to repeat
confronting and

232
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,420
anxiety, we know anxiety's involved here.

233
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,506
So, we're also studying internet.

234
00:13:53,506 --> 00:14:01,610
These treatments and online

235
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,620
support communities, just to describe what
those internet based treatments entail.

236
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:11,690
Online su, support communities may help
odontophobics, and

237
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,480
I feel like we need some more information
about these studies.

238
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,952
So, if this, you know, author is trying to
tell us about these low cost simple

239
00:14:18,952 --> 00:14:22,520
interventions, and these new, potential
treatments, we would want to add some more

240
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,890
details about this about this here, about
these studies on internet based therapies.

241
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,150
So that should be kind of it's own
paragraph I think.

242
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,370
And then, we will get in the next
paragraph,

243
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,100
we'll get finally back to the drug
therapy.

244
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,030
So, I think we do have to mention the drug
therapy because probably some patients,

245
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,820
have to have drugs to do this.

246
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,320
So maybe, you know, even in addition to
some of these great simple or

247
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,410
past intervention, some patients are still
going to be traditional drug therapy,

248
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:55,240
some patients will, you know, still
require drug or

249
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,930
drugs to manage, anxiety or pain, and then
those drugs would include so

250
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:08,090
what we can pharmalogical options, these
aren't all,

251
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,510
you know, drugs you would take by mouth,
so as a pharmalogical options include,

252
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,240
and here's, the list of them, intra,
intraligamen,

253
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,869
I can't even pronounce that word, that's
just anaesthetics that you take.

254
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,870
That are ejected into the teeth, so we
could just say, local anesthetics, or

255
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,220
anesthetic injections.

256
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,660
I'm not sure what computer controlled
injections are, and how that differs from

257
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,430
anesthetic injections, so I think I'll
just get rid of that for now.

258
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,768
sedation, so anesthetic injections,
sedation with nitrous

259
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:43,700
oxide anti-anxiety drugs, which I took
away from,

260
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,350
I had mit, took that out of an earlier
place, I'm going to put that back.

261
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,770
So anti-anxiety drugs and then finally
general anaesthesia is the other one,

262
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,470
right, I mean, general anesthesia would
be, would put somebody completely under.

263
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,960
So that's another option.

264
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,640
So those are all the pharmacological
options.

265
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,080
We probably need some more details to
flesh out this paragraph here about just

266
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,550
what are some potential harms if we're, if
this essay is about alternatives to drugs,

267
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,570
what are some potential harms for drug
therapy.

268
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,200
Do they maybe not always work.

269
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,987
So maybe more details about the risks and
benefits of drug therapy.

270
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:25,255
[SOUND].

271
00:16:25,255 --> 00:16:29,413
And then finally we will need some kind of
concluding paragraph that gets,

272
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:33,505
again, the concluding, concluding
paragraph may depend a little bit on

273
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:36,810
what is the actual focus, the theme of
this essay.

274
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,710
But I like the sentence here,

275
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,340
oral hygiene continues to be the best way
to avoid going to the dentist.

276
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,760
Making that point, I think, is important.

277
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,450
I would say yeah, but, good oral hygiene
continues to the best way to

278
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,510
avoid going to the dentist but that
doesn't solve the phobia.

279
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,750
Indeed you know, even if you're great at
oral hygiene, you still might have to go

280
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,920
to the dentist for an emergency as the
author alluded to earlier.

281
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,460
So we still need to solve this problem
about the phobia.

282
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,650
I added, I wasn't quite sure how to
conclude this because again,

283
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,390
I'm not quite sure of the, the exact focus
of this essay, but if it's,

284
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,470
we're focusing in at dentist, that advice
for

285
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,610
dentists you could say something like
dentists should consider the wide range of

286
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:20,059
options for helping patients with
odontophobia.

287
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,500
To successfully, receive dental care, so
maybe this essay, the point is just to

288
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,910
let dentists know about all these wide
different options that are out there.

289
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,550
Maybe we need a little bit more of a
conclusion, again,

290
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,810
if the, if the essay is trying to make a
point, if there's a clear point here,

291
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,070
it would be nice for the author to wrap up
here with kind of

292
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,610
restating that the point of the of the
essay.
