1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,110
So for those of you who want some more
mathematical details.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,580
You want me to derive the formula that
I've just showed on the last slide.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,020
Let me rewrite that formula so you can see
it written out.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,060
To save myself some writing here,

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,330
I'm going to use Po to represent the
probability of the disease,

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,040
in the reference group, what I was calling
P ref before.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,160
So that's the formula that we're trying to
derive.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,730
So, It's just really algebra to derive it,
but for

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,175
those of you who are curious, let me do it
out here.

10
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:41,675
So we can write that.

11
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:47,840
The probability of getting the outcome in
the exposed group.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,040
Another way to write that is just a risk
ratio times the probability of

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,570
getting the disease in the unexposed
group.

14
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,510
So if you multiply the probability of
getting the disease in the unexposed group

15
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,200
by the risk ratio,

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,980
that gives you the probability of getting
the disease in the exposed group.

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,150
So that's a useful piece of information to
have.

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,260
And then we can write out what the odds
ratio is.

19
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,790
What is the odds ratio in terms of all of
these things?

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,180
The odds ratio is the odds of getting the
disease in the exposed group divided

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,890
by the odds of getting the disease in the
unexposed group, in the reference group.

22
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:23,430
So, since we said that the, that p exposed
is just equal to the risk ratio times Po,

23
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,500
that's the probability of getting the
disease in the exposed group.

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,660
The probability of not getting it there is
for 1 minus that.

25
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,610
So that's the numerator for the odds
ratio.

26
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,810
So that represents the odds of getting the
disease in the exposed group.

27
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,980
The odds of getting the disease in the
unexposed group, the reference group is

28
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,810
just Po divided by 1 minus Po.

29
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,470
So then we can just do a little bit of
algebraic rearrangement here, right?

30
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,520
So what I'm going to do is a just a little
of algebra.

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,440
So I'm going to multiply both sides of the
equation by Po over 1 minus Po.

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:06,370
So that will then give me the odds ratio
times Po

33
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:12,170
over 1 minus Po is equal to that.

34
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:21,320
So now if you noticed,

35
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,970
both sides of the equation have a Po in
the numerator so

36
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,228
I'm going to cancel that will make things
easier.

37
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:30,950
Then I'm going to cross multiply both
sides by the denominators of

38
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,610
the other side.

39
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,116
So OR times 1 minus RRPo is equal to RR
times 1 minus Po.

40
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:38,780
Next I'm just going to multiply

41
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,500
across that odds ratio, using the
distributive property.

42
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:59,172
That's OR minus OR, times RR, times Po,

43
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:06,390
equal to RR, minus RRPo.

44
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,640
And then I'm trying to isolate the RR, so
I'm going to add this term to the other

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,338
side to get all the RR's, the risk ratios
on one side.

46
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:19,611
So that's plus OR

47
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:24,550
times RR times Po.

48
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:30,448
So now we get the, the odds ratio is equal
to the risk ratio minus

49
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:36,200
RRPo plus OR times RR times Po.

50
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,310
We can then take the risk ratio out of all
of that.

51
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,522
So that's 1 minus Po plus OR times Po.

52
00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:51,180
And that's equal to the OR

53
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,930
and then all we have to do is divide both
sides by that term so

54
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,760
we get what we're looking for, 1 minus Po
plus OR times Po.

55
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,590
So there it is.

56
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,550
There is the derivation.

57
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,280
If your a so inclined to like that kind of
proof.
