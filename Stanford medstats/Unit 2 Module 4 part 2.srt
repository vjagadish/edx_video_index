1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,310
All right, so turning now from the Vioxx
story.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,460
I went over rate ratios and risk ratios.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:12,056
I now want to turn to hazard ratios which
again are directly related to rate ratios.

4
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:13,800
We're going to see these later in the
course, so

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,530
you don't have to worry about all the
details now.

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,220
The hazard ratio can be interpreted just
like a rate ratio.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,780
I'm just going to walk you through it a
little bit,

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,750
so that you'll be familiar with it if you
see it in the literature.

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,800
Again we'll, we'll talk in more detail.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,539
Later in the course.

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,650
So hazard ratios are calculated using,

12
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,020
a type of regression technique called Cox
regression.

13
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,160
This is a complimentary regression.

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,630
They are usually multivariant adjusted.

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,430
And I'll just show you an example of a
hazard ratio in the literature.

16
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,760
This was a study comparing a drug,
Ranolazine to a placebo.

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,440
And they were looking at the outcome.

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,840
It was a composite outcome.

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,130
They were looking at death, myocardial
infarction, heart attack, or

20
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,540
recurrent ischemia,

21
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,030
they wanted to know if they could reduce
that composite outcome with this drug.

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,640
Here is the hazard ratio I have circled it
for you for the primary endpoint, turned

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,380
out to be 0.92, so we would interpret that
as an 8% reduction in the rate.

24
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,270
Of this primary end point.

25
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,030
In the drug and the active drug group
compared with the placebo group.

26
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,610
Now that wasn't statistically significant.

27
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,600
You can see that the confidence interval
ranges from 0.83 to 1.02.

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,830
So we're not completely sure that the true
value isn't 1.0.

29
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,510
Right, that the null value falls within
that window.

30
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,870
So it's not statistically significant.

31
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,970
It's a small reduction.

32
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,430
But that's how you would interpret the
hazard ratio.

33
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,260
Now we're going to move to the odds ratio.

34
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,130
We're going to spend the rest of this
module and all of next month.

35
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,330
The next module on the odds ratio.

36
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,518
Odds ratios are just another measure of
relative risk.

37
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,550
You're going to see in a minute that
they're kind of funny and

38
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,757
you're going to wonder why they even
exist.

39
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:48,560
But there's two reasons that they exist.

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,085
First of all, they're they only valid
measure of relative risk for

41
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:53,624
case-control studies, so why is that?

42
00:01:53,624 --> 00:01:56,520
So remember, for a case-control study,

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,185
you cannot calculate the risk of disease
or the rate of disease.

44
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:04,810
Because, at the investigator goes out and
finds cases.

45
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,400
So the proportion of cases in the study
just reflects the study design.

46
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,410
It does not say anything about the
prevalence or

47
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,479
risk of disease in the general population.

48
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,420
Therefore we can't estimate the risk or

49
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,490
prevalence of disease in the general
population.

50
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,240
Since we can't estimate disease frequency,
we can't estimate risk ratios or

51
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,770
weight ratios.

52
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,200
It turns out that the odds ratio, for
mathematical reasons, is valid though.

53
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,270
The more important reason that you're
going to see odds ratios all over

54
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,794
the medical literature is because of
logistic regression.

55
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:39,070
So even when you're doing cohort studies
and cross-sectional studies.

56
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:43,880
Author's may choose to run a statistical
technique called logistic regression.

57
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,470
When you have a binary outcome and you
want to adjust for

58
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,100
confounders the typical statistical test
that people use is logistic regression.

59
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,640
It happens that logistic regression gives
you out odds ratios.

60
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
So that's what you get out of the logistic
regression,

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,240
that's what people usually report.

62
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,200
And this means there's a lot of logistic
regression is run in the literature,

63
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,316
there's a lot of odds ratios in the, in
the literature.

64
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:11,584
To understand odds ratios, first of all
you have to understand, what is an odds.

65
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:16,150
An odds is just the probability of an
event happening divided by

66
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,890
the probability of it not happening.

67
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,330
And that's a really funny measure to get
your head around unless you're a somebody

68
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,260
who does horse betting or gambling or

69
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,780
sports betting, you probably don't think
in odds.

70
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,210
I certainly don't think in odds.

71
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,390
I think in probabilities.

72
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,090
What's the chance of something happening?

73
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:30,850
I don't think about,

74
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,840
what's the chance of it happening divided
by the chance of it not happening.

75
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,640
But it turns out that odds have some nice
mathematical properties, and

76
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,440
that's why they come up.

77
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,870
So let's just walk through a couple of
examples.

78
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,840
So if the risk is 50%.

79
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,370
If the risk of something happening is 50%.

80
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,370
That means there is one chance that it'll
happen, and one chance that it won't.

81
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,470
The, if the risk of it happening is 50%.

82
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,640
Then the risk of it not happening is 50%.

83
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:03,400
So that would make the rip, the odds 1 to
1.

84
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,400
If the risk of something happening is 75%,
reach it times of 4 it's going to happen.

85
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,800
So 1 times out of 4 it's not going to
happen.

86
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,840
So the odds would be 3 to 1.

87
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,500
If the risk of something happening is 10%,
1 out of 10, that means 1 out of 10 times

88
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,180
it will happen, and 9 out of the 10 times
it won't, so the odds would be 1 to 9.

89
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,980
If the risk is 1%, 1 out of 100, the odds
would be 1 to 99.

90
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:32,300
Now notice that if you think of an odds as
a fraction, so we're, I could rewrite this

91
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,310
as 1 over 1, 3 over 1, 1 over 9, I could
rewrite this as fractions.

92
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,210
If you think of the odds as fractions,

93
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,350
notice that the odds is always higher than
the corresponding risk.

94
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,550
Alright, one is higher than a half, 1 out
of 99 is higher than 1 out of 100.

95
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,907
So the odds is always higher than its
corresponding probability.

96
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:56,930
But, if you're talking about small risks,
so

97
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,625
like 1 out of 100, and 1 out of 10, the
odds and the risk are very close in

98
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:05,290
magnitude; 1 out of 100 isn't that
different from 1 out of 99.

99
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,630
So if you're talking about rare events,
the odds and the risks are similar.

100
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,790
However, if you're talking about common
events, like when the risk is 50% or 75%.

101
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,150
Then the odds and the risk look very
different.

102
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,110
So keep that in mind.

103
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,160
Because that's going to be true of the
odds ratio.

104
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,740
When you have a common event, the odds
ratio and

105
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,440
the risks ratio are going to diverge.

106
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,860
When you have a very rare event, however,
the risk ratio and

107
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,210
the odds ratio are going to look a lot
alike.
