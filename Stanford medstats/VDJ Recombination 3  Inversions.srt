1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,080
Now this is the third part of this story.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,880
It's kind of an add on to explain to

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,000
students how inversions can occur during
VDJ recombination.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,420
I'm going to draw for

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,752
you the kind of an abbreviated version of
the aminoglobulin gene.

6
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:26,496
So I'm going to give you [SOUND] a D
region.

7
00:00:26,496 --> 00:00:31,826
Here's a D region.

8
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:34,675
Just as in the previous diagrams, here's
the D region.

9
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:39,190
[SOUND]
And I'm going to give you a J region.

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:44,638
[BLANK_AUDIO]

11
00:00:44,638 --> 00:00:46,976
That's downstream from it.

12
00:00:46,976 --> 00:00:50,409
Here's J region.

13
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:52,370
And I'm going to draw upstream, a V
region.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,072
[BLANK_AUDIO]

15
00:01:01,072 --> 00:01:03,913
[SOUND]

16
00:01:03,913 --> 00:01:06,904
[BLANK_AUDIO]

17
00:01:06,904 --> 00:01:08,975
D region.

18
00:01:08,975 --> 00:01:12,829
And so we're going to do D to J joining
except remember that

19
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:15,946
recombination activating genes RAG-1 and

20
00:01:15,946 --> 00:01:20,630
RAG-2 always do cleavages between at a red
RSS and a blue RSS.

21
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:26,030
A red recombination signal sequence and a
blue recombination signal sequence.

22
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,905
So just, it doesn't really know how
they're oriented,

23
00:01:29,905 --> 00:01:32,650
because it doesn't really care.

24
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,440
And DNA can fold up anyway.

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,130
So, suppose RAG-1 and RAG-2 do their
cleavages at these arrows.

26
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,850
There's no reason why they can't, they
just follow the rules.

27
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,060
They just recognize recombination signal
sequences and do the cleavage.

28
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,650
And so you end up with the following
cleavage.

29
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,140
So let me draw that cleavage for you.

30
00:01:58,363 --> 00:02:04,698
[BLANK_AUDIO]

31
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:11,429
And this is the uncleaved part,

32
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:18,170
and this is, the cleaved part.

33
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:26,460
Oh, let's, let me do that, and make it
cleaner for you.

34
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,967
So, there we are.

35
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:34,700
Okay, there's the J, there's the D,

36
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,650
and then there are spaces for the two
cleavages.

37
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,702
And now having done this remember the
recombination, RAG-1 and

38
00:02:43,702 --> 00:02:47,930
RAG-2, the recombination activating genes,
stay stuck on the signal ends,

39
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,590
covering them up and not allowing them to
be joined right away.

40
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,620
So, as a result, there are two coding
ends.

41
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,210
One end for the D, one end for the J.

42
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,560
And they're going to end up getting joined
to each other.

43
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,880
So, in order for that to happen, this
piece of

44
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,978
DNA has to swing around to come over here.

45
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:12,626
And so obviously, the other side of the
DNA,

46
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:16,400
swing around and come over here.

47
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,790
So, let's, let's draw the swing around, so
that you can see everything.

48
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,570
It's now going to look like this.

49
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,583
[BLANK_AUDIO]

50
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,520
And.

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,256
[BLANK_AUDIO]

52
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:35,858
I'm just swinging everything around, so
it's all backwards.

53
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:42,969
[BLANK_AUDIO]

54
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:43,956
Okay?

55
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:53,956
[BLANK_AUDIO]

56
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:13,543
So you can see that all I've done is take
that middle segment and

57
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:18,365
rotate it around so that the D region over
here is now backwards, and

58
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:23,630
I'm going to designate it as backwards by
drawing D in a backwards fashion.

59
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:31,960
And the J region is still sitting here
waiting to be joined to the D region.

60
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,648
And this, this peripheral signal sequences
are,

61
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:37,097
are still there right, waiting to be
joined.

62
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:42,708
And now when the joining occurs, boom,
you've, you've now got an inversion

63
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:47,395
of the segment containing the D, from the
D segment all the way up to

64
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:52,864
a recombination signal sequence, so that's
how the inversion will occur.

65
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:53,500
Okay, thank you.
