1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,990
In this next module we're going to talk
about the concept of

2
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,760
expected value which is just a fancy word
for mean which is a concept we've

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,770
already alked about in this course but the
expected value is a really great tool for

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,150
making good decisions so we're going to
spend a lot of time on expected value.

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,370
So what is expected value?

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,840
Again, it's just the mean.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,580
It's the mean of a probability
distribution.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,530
And the way that we calculate this mean is
slightly different than the way that we

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,110
calculated the mean when we had data.

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,150
So when we had data, we calculated the
mean by adding up everybody's values, and

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,000
dividing by n.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,610
That doesn't quite work when we have a
probability distribution.

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,870
Because, for a probability distribution,

14
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,730
certain outcomes occur more frequently
than other outcomes.

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,060
And, we have to factor that in.

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,400
So, what we're doing is we're actually
weighting the value of

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,170
each outcome by it's probability.

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,680
So, it's a weighted average.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,700
That's a little bit different than how we
calculate a mean for

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,260
sample data where everybody occurs.

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,220
Equally frequently.

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,170
And again expected value is just this
great concept.

23
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,900
I love to talk about expected value
because it helps us to

24
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,490
make informed decisions and the idea is,
that we're talking about,

25
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,450
on average, what do we expect to happen in
the long run?

26
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,490
So this gets back to this frequentest view
of probablility.

27
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,190
WE're saying, in the long run How, y'know,
h- -- what value do we think will occur.

28
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,970
That -- so kind of put that in the back of
your mind.

29
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,800
We're talking about if you could repeat
things over and

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,740
over again, how often will, will different
outcomes occur.

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,670
It's a frequentist view.

32
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,020
So expected value, to calculate it,

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,480
all we're going to do is we're going to --
we need the probability distribution.

34
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,670
Once we have that We're going to take each
value of x, each possible outcome,

35
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,960
we're going to take it's value, and

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,900
we're going to multiply it by its
probability, how frequently it occurs.

37
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:01,310
So, outcomes that occur more frequently
will be weighted higher in this sum.

38
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,560
We're going to take those weighted values
and

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,630
we're going to add them all up, so, this
is just saying add up.

40
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,380
All the x's times their probability.

41
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,470
All of the possible outcomes times their
probability.

42
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,410
I'm going to show you some examples of how
to calculate that.

43
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,210
Now, I just want to show you.

44
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,300
I'm not going to spend to much time on the
continuous case.

45
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,010
Because it's really beyond the scope of
this course.

46
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,460
But I'm just going to show you how this
extends to the continuous case.

47
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,540
So, in the discrete case, we're adding
things up.

48
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,760
So it's a summation sign.

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,160
When you move to the continuous case.

50
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,570
When you have an infinite number of
possible things to add up.

51
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,660
Here, instead of summing, you're
integrating.

52
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,120
So that's the analogy.

53
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,610
The analogy in the continuous case is the
summation sign becomes an integral.

54
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,970
But notice it's otherwise exactly the
same.

55
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,060
For, we're going to integrate over all
possible values of x.

56
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,010
We're going to take x and weight it by its
probability.

57
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,260
But since there's an infinite number of
possible x's,

58
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,470
we have to do an integral here rather than
just adding up Discrete values.

59
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,180
Again, we're not going to talk to much
about the continuous case, so

60
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,640
don't get thrown by the integral.

61
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,910
But, just to give you a sense that it
extends to the continuous case.

62
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,950
It's very easy to calculate expected value
for the discrete case.

63
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,070
So, recall we have this probability
distribution about how many patients were

64
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,410
arriving in the emergency room.

65
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,620
Within a given hour.

66
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,040
And let's say you know, so again, this is
an artificial distribution, but

67
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,560
let's say this was the actual
distribution.

68
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,060
What is the expected value or mean number
of patients in any given hour?

69
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,230
How on average, how many patients are we
expecting to see per hour?

70
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,040
That's an important piece of information
for

71
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,000
determining Resources for the emergency
group.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,880
So just as when we have talked about the
sample mean,

73
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,850
you can think about the expected value as
a balancing point.

74
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:42,280
If each of those numbers 0.3, 0.3, 0.2
those represent masses on a fulcrum,

75
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,570
on a lever, the mean is the point where
you have to

76
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,320
put the fulcrum to balance those masses,
the same concept.

77
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,820
Now students tend to be tempted.

78
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,790
If I tell students to calculate the mean
here.

79
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,700
Their first instinct is to just add up the
five numbers and divide by five, right?

80
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,760
You're tempted to just go oh,

81
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,770
I have to calculate a mean, so it's nine
plus ten, plus 11, plus 12, plus 13.

82
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,020
Add those up, divide by five.

83
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,650
That's how you've always calculated a mean
all your life.

84
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,125
But that's not going to be quite right
here because 9 occurs more frequently then

85
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:18,770
13 so we have to wait 9 by the fact that
it occurs more frequently so

86
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:23,650
to calculate the expected value what we're
going to do is take the value of each x so

87
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,790
of each outcome.

88
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,570
And multiple by it's probablity.

89
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,400
So 9 times 0.3 and then we're going to add
that to each other outcome.

90
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,575
So we're going to do 9 times 0.3 plus 10
times 0.3 plus 11 times 0.2 plus

91
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:41,759
12 times 0.1 plus 13 times 0.1 when you
add all that out, sum it all up,

92
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,379
it comes out to 10.4.

93
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:48,860
On average we're seeing 10.4 people in the
emergency room in any given hour.

94
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,615
So we gotta remember when you're
calculating these that you have to

95
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:56,370
weight them because the outcomes don't
occur equally frequently.

96
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,370
Now a sample mean is actually just a
special case of expected value.

97
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,970
So, remember in the first week of the
course, when we calculated the sample

98
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,980
mean, what we did was to add up the values
for everybody in our sample and

99
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,252
divide by n, that's something you've been
doing all your life.

100
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:18,920
Well that, if I'm just rearrange the
summation a little bit here,

101
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,060
I can show you that that's the same as
taking every persons value and

102
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,380
multiplying it by 1 over n, and then
adding those up.

103
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,150
So, every person is being weighted by 1
over n.

104
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,290
That's their probability.

105
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,980
That's their frequency in the sample.

106
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,150
It just happens that everybody counts
once.

107
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,190
So, everybody has the same weight.

108
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,680
So, we don't actually have to multiply
everybody by the weight.

109
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,020
We can just divide by n at the end.

110
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,190
But really, that's everybody's weight.

111
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,150
Everybody has a probability in this
sample,

112
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,770
frequency in the sample of 1 over n.

113
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,270
So this is really,

114
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,090
the sample mean is really just a special
case of expected value.

115
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,430
I was, just make sure we're keeping our,
our symbol straight here.

116
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,000
So when I talk about sample means I use
this symbol X bar.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,780
That means we calculated the mean from
sample data.

118
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,570
When I'm talking about calculating means
from probability distributions,

119
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,560
which are theoretical things rather than
from data.

120
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,120
I'm either going to use the symbol mu,
which is a Greek letter or

121
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,710
I will interchangeably use E of x, which
just stands for expected value of x.

122
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,090
Remember, the mean and the expected value
of x are the same thing.

123
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,820
It turns out to be easier on a typewriter
sometimes to write E of x rather than to

124
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,140
find the Greek symbol mu.

125
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,920
So, you'll see a lot of times I'll just
use E x.

126
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,890
Instead 'cause it's easier on my
typewriter, but those mean the same thing.
