1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,890
So, I told you that Cox Regression only
estimates hazard ratios.

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,060
It doesn't estimate the underlying
survival curve.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,500
However, I do want to let you know that it
is possible to

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,647
pair up the results from a Cox regression.

5
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:21,320
With a non-parametric estimate of the
survival curve so

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,400
that you can essentially get the best of
both worlds.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,340
So Cox regression estimates the effects of
each predictor, the hazard ratios.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,530
Without estimating that underlying hazard
or survival function.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,790
But you can take the results from the Cox
regression.

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,750
Which tells you which tell you how much
each predictor contributes to

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,630
the mortality rate or the rate of event.

12
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,620
And you can pair it up with the results
from a non-parametric estimate of

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,500
the survival group such as a Kaplan Meyer.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,650
And I'm just going to illustrate this with
an example.

15
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,680
So this example,

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,700
a data set comes from Applied Survival
Analysis by Hosmer and Lemeshow.

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,430
And it, they had some data from early in
the AIDS epidemic on a sample size of 100.

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,930
Now this was early in the AIDS epidemic.

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,740
So as you'll see that that death rates
were pretty high.

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,380
The outcome here is time to death.

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,920
And, we're just going to look at two
predictors.

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,910
A person's age, and whether or not they
were an IV drug user.

23
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,800
IV drug users were hit very hard early in
the AIDS epidemic, of course.

24
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,560
So just to show you the effect of these
two predictors using Kaplan-Meier curves.

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,860
What you're seeing over here on the right
is the IV drug use.

26
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,570
So the bottom curve represents the IV drug
users.

27
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,600
And the top curve is the non-drug users.

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,120
And you can see that survival overall was
pretty poor for both groups.

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,830
But the IV drug users did much worse.

30
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,480
Their much higher risk group probably had
a higher co-morbidities.

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,150
Age of course is a continuous predictor.

32
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,650
So it's hard to do in a Kaplan-Meier.

33
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,180
But you had, you can categorize age to
make a Kaplan-Meier plot.

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,320
So that's what I've done on the left here.

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,260
So this is the greater than, or,

36
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,030
sorry, this, the, the ones who did the
best is the young group.

37
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,960
So the less than 30 group had the, the
best survival.

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,620
The worst survival was in the age group
greater than or equal to 40.

39
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,390
So you can see that clearly,

40
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,480
age in IV drug users strongly related to
survival here.

41
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,750
We can then run a Cox Regression model,

42
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,430
which models the effects of age and drug
use.

43
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,408
And so I've done that now with this data
set.

44
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,040
Notice there's no intercepts in the
output.

45
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,820
Because, again, in a Cox regression we
don't get any intercepts.

46
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,630
So you can see that both IV drug use and

47
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,830
age were highly significantly related to
to death here.

48
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,120
We get hazard ratios.

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,760
So the hazard ratio for IV drug use is
2.5.

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,390
So IV drug users were 2.5 fold,

51
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,725
had a mortality rate that was 2.5 fold
higher than non-drug users.

52
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:49,390
The hazard ratio for age is 1.096.

53
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,230
Which looks small, but remember this is
for every one year increase in age.

54
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,940
So just going up one year in age increased
your mortality rate by almost 10%.

55
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,540
So that's actually a pretty big effect.

56
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,870
So those are the results from the Cox
regression.

57
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,360
But what we can do is we can pair up the
Cox regression model

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,760
with the Kaplan-Meier estimates of the
survival curve.

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,590
And that's what I'll show you now.

60
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,105
So I actually want to show you what's
right here first.

61
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:18,300
This is the Kaplan-Meier curve, survival
curve for

62
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,140
the entire cohort, not stratified on
anything.

63
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,902
So we, not taking into account age or
anything, just the whole cohort.

64
00:03:24,902 --> 00:03:27,630
The whole 100 people, that's the survival
curve.

65
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,720
We compare that curve up again with the
Cox Regression.

66
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,000
And that's what I'm showing you on the
left here.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,400
This is kind of results from the Cox
regression model.

68
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,900
So, we take the estimates of Kaplanâ€“Meier.

69
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,880
And then we factor in, how does age and

70
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,860
drug use, how do those affect the survival
curve?

71
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,980
This curve I'm showing you on the left
takes just the mean value of age and

72
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,510
the mean value of drug use.

73
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,620
Which will be a percentage.

74
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,020
And plugs those in and then draws a
survival curve.

75
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,450
Since I'm taking the mean age and mean
drug use value at the sample.

76
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm going to get a curve that looks
basically just like the Kaplan-Meier curve

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,960
for the overall cohort.

78
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,110
That's what I'm showing you here.

79
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,740
So that doesn't look particularly useful.

80
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,540
Because it looks, it's like, why not just
use the Kaplan-Meier curve?

81
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,040
What's useful though is then, you can go
in and rather than use the mean age.

82
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,120
You can plug in different values for age
and drug use.

83
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,615
To get curves for different groups of
people.

84
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:21,515
And that's what I've done next.

85
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:25,150
So here I'm showing you two different
types of people.

86
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,480
I'm drawing the survival curve on the
left.

87
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,360
Stay inside here, for somebody who is 55
years old.

88
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,000
This is their predicted survival curve.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,850
They're 55 years old, and they are an IV
drug user.

90
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,330
Those are two hits against them.

91
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,630
They're very, very high risk.

92
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,210
And you can see that their surv, their
predicted survival is that, for

93
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,300
that group, the predicted survival curve
is very, very low.

94
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,020
That is, it's it drops extremely steeply.

95
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,300
In the middle line here, the solid line,
is the predicted survival curve.

96
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,680
And the dotted lines represent the 95%
confidence intervals around that.

97
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,460
You can also put those on.

98
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,560
So you can see that, you know, somebody,
obviously because age and drug use were so

99
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,940
related to survival, that that person is
predicted to die, to die very quickly.

100
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,970
For somebody who's younger and

101
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,130
is not an IV drug user, their survival
probabilities look much better.

102
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,940
So, this is the predicted curve for

103
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,500
somebody age 22 who is not an IV drug
user.

104
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,930
And again, these outer bounds, these
dotted lines,

105
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,610
just represent the 95% confidence
interval.

106
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,430
So, this is very nice.

107
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,150
Because now you have a way to actually get
absolute predicted values for

108
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,120
survival probabilities for certain people.

109
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,550
And to draw nice graphics, which you can't
get if you just use Cox regression alone.
