00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,630
Hi, my name is Sharon Chen.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,220
I'm a pediatric infectious disease
physician, and

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,590
I take care of many children with
respiratory viral infections.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,490
In this video I want to share with you the
important concepts about

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,160
all respiratory viruses.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,640
I will also introduce you to the anatomic
framework that we will use in this

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,980
video and in other subsequent videos that
dive deeper in each respiratory virus.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,520
This video is an overview about all
respiratory viruses with a focus on

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,460
the clinical syndromes.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,290
The learning objectives are to define the
different syndromes caused by

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,560
respiratory viruses and to name the main
viral pathogens.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,030
Here is the pathogen list for our course,
and in this video and the entire module,

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,490
I will be discussing these viruses that
cause respiratory infections.

15
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,720
Respiratory viral infections are something
that I know you have all

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,570
experienced personally, and that you will
see a lot of as a physician.

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,270
You will usually not know which virus is
causing your patient's symptoms.

18
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,460
But in this video we will teach you about
the clinical syndromes and the hallmark

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,430
viruses that cause these syndromes, so
that you can make an educated guess.

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,210
We want you to learn what the typical
clinical presentation is of each one of

21
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,990
these respiratory viruses so

22
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,410
that you can make a better decision about
when not to give antibiotics.

23
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,020
Or when your patient may get clinically
worse and need to be in the hospital.

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,220
Now the pie chart here shows you some of
the names of the common respiratory

25
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,310
viruses, and as you can see rhinovirus and
influenza virus are quite prevalent.

26
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,200
Now it may be daunting to learn all these
respiratory viruses, so

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,180
that ones that I just named and their
biology and what symptoms they cause.

28
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,700
But we've created a way to simplify this
all for you.

29
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,920
The beauty about clinical syndromes of
respiratory viruses is that they can

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,530
actually be organized anatomically.

31
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,770
So in the next series of images, well,
I'll show you the clinical syndromes and

32
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,180
their associated hallmark or

33
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,510
typical virus mapped anatomically to the
upper and lower respiratory tract.

34
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,690
This can help you later when you review
this material.

35
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,300
We will discuss each one of these clinical
syndromes and

36
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,970
their associated virus in depth, in later
videos.

37
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,710
Now, think back to the last time you had a
cold.

38
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,370
What was the most annoying symptom that
you had?

39
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,550
Many of you might have said a stuffy nose,
or congestion, dripping mucus.

40
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,780
And this clinical syndrome is what we call
Rhinitis.

41
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,710
And so this is specifically infectious
Rhinitis, not allergic Rhinitis.

42
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,160
It involves inflammation of the nasal
cavity only.

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,930
And the typical viruses that cause
Rhinitis are Rhinovirus and Corona Virus.

44
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,550
Further down the upper respiratory tract
is a nasal pharynx or

45
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,480
pharynx involved chords.

46
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,610
When this area is infected,

47
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,480
we get clinical syndromes of sore throat
and hoarseness.

48
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,590
And we term these Pharyngitis and
Laryngitis.

49
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,120
The viruses that typically infect these
locations are different than those

50
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,430
that infect the nasal cavity.

51
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,430
Adenovirus and Parainfluenza virus are the
most prominent viruses.

52
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:05,910
We've decided to

53
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,200
define the lower respiratory tract as
below the vocal cords.

54
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,670
And in general, lower respiratory tract
infections can be more severe.

55
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,980
Because the infection can cause gas
exchange leading to hypoxia.

56
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,290
The smaller airways or bronchioles are
also easier to fill up with a lot of

57
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,130
mucus and this causes breathing problems.

58
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,300
Sometimes these patients will actually
have to be hospitalized.

59
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,230
And that's in contrast to the majority of
patients who

60
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,780
have upper respiratory tract infections.

61
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,820
One clinical syndrome that's classic in
young children is Croup.

62
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,550
And this is also known as
Laryngotracheo-bronchitis.

63
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,770
The word Croup comes from the sound of the
cough, which is hoarse and barking.

64
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,250
And young children are more affected,

65
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,810
because the size of their airway is
smaller.

66
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,400
Croup involves swelling swelling of the
area right below the vocal cords.

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,740
We'll discuss a lot more about Croup in
later videos.

68
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,540
The typical virus that causes Croup is
Parainfluenza.

69
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,860
Lower down the lower respiratory tract are
the large bronchi that branch off

70
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,410
the trachea at the level of the Carina.

71
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,260
Infection bronchi causes Bronchitis.

72
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,750
An inflammation of the mucus membranes of
the bronchi leads to a lot of

73
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,350
secretions and then that needs to be
cleared by coughing.

74
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,640
Patients with Bronchitis have a lot of
coughing.

75
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,760
And this cough can actually last for many
weeks.

76
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,720
Any of the common respiratory viruses can
cause Bronchitis.

77
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,400
And we've listed them on this slide.

78
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,350
The bronchi branch off into smaller
airways called bronchioles.

79
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,700
An infection of bronchioles is called
Bronchiolitis,

80
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,180
which is clinically more severe in infants
and young children.

81
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,590
The size of the bronchioles in infants and
young children are smaller compared to

82
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,520
adults, and thus it's easier to block up
with all the mucus and cellular debris.

83
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,360
Most of the respiratory viruses can also
cause this clinical syndrome.

84
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,730
But RSV, which is short for

85
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,840
Respiratory Syncytial Virus, is the
typical virus for Bronchiolitis.

86
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,240
At the end of the bronchial trees are the
alveoli, and

87
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,440
this is where gas exchange occurs.

88
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,920
When these areas are involved,

89
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,770
when infection of the alveolar epithelium,
we call this Pneumonia.

90
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:23,060
Inflammation around the alveoli decreases
gas exchange and this can lead to hypoxia.

91
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,810
And really increases the severity of this
particular infection.

92
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,840
All of the respiratory viruses can cause
Pneumonia.

93
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,220
Influenza is the typical virus that causes
viral Pneumonia.

94
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,020
The anatomic framework we hope will allow
you to organize and

95
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,120
remember these respiratory viruses.

96
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,640
The location of the infection determines
the clinical symptoms, and

97
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,570
certain viruses have a predilection for
infecting certain locations.

98
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,380
However, it is important to remember that
there's a lot of overlap.

99
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,560
Many of these viruses can cause many of
these clinical syndromes.

100
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,250
What we listed on this slide are the most
typical respiratory viruses for

101
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,560
each clinical syndrome.

102
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,040
Sometimes respiratory viral infections can
be

103
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,670
complicated by secondary bacterial
infections.

104
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,500
The same anatomic locations that I showed
you for the respiratory virus

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,630
infections can also manifest clinical
syndromes due to bacteria infection.

106
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,790
For example, a viral Rhinitis can be

107
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:29,040
complicated by a bacterial infection of
the sinus causing Sinusitis.

108
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,730
Now some of these clinical syndromes that
I've listed on this slide can be

109
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:36,570
bacterial infections without a preceding
viral infection.

110
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,870
For example, strep throat is a Faringitis
caused by Streptacacus Piogenese.

111
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,460
And Bordatella Pertussis can cause
Bronchitis.

112
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,880
Different from respiratory viral
infections, bacteria infections of

113
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,550
the upper and lower respiratory tract need
to be treated with antibiotics.

114
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,860
These bacterial infections that I've
listed on the slide will be discussed in

115
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,320
depth in other modules.

116
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,620
The last clinical syndrome that is listed
on this particular image is Pneumonia.

117
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,310
This is a very important clinical syndrome
to pay attention to because some of

118
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,390
these patients can actually have really
severe infection.

119
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,770
So when we take care of patients with
Pneumonia we want to distinguish whether

120
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,880
that Pneumonia is caused by a virus or a
bacteria, and this is not so easy.

121
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,730
The clinical symptoms are pretty similar
but if you happen to get a chest x-ray,

122
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,280
the typical chest x-rays can look quite
different.

123
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,580
So in general, viral Pneumonias tend to be
diffused, affecting both lungs.

124
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,840
And so the chest x-ray I'm showing you
here is of a 12-month-old infant,

125
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,960
who is presenting with rapid breathing and
cough.

126
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,360
And what you can see in this chest x-ray
is this haziness in both sides of

127
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,880
the lungs.

128
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,969
And this suggests a very diffuse process.

129
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,310
Bacterial Pneumonias can have many
patterns on chest x-rays, but

130
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,810
in general they tend to be more focal.

131
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,340
So this chest x-ray on the right is of a
six-year-old little girl.

132
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,210
She has fever, cough, chest pain when
she's breathing.

133
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,608
And what you can see is a demarcated area
of whiteness in the left lung.

134
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:14,568
This represents alveoli filled with
inflammatory infiltrate within that

135
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:16,850
particular lung segment.

136
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,930
Now, keep in mind that this is a broad
generalization.

137
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,050
There are bacteria, such as mycoplasma,
that can also cause a generalized abnor,

138
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,250
abnormal pattern of both lungs.

139
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:35,609
