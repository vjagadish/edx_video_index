00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,970
Welcome to week 3 of HRP 261.

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,830
This week we're going to delve into
Logistic Regression,

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,220
which is a topic that we'll be talking
about over multiple weeks.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,450
So let's see where we are on our
statistical chart here.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,280
So we're going to talk today mostly about
logistic regression.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,200
That's used when you have a categorical
outcome, but you want to adjust for

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,010
confounders or look at multiple variables
at once.

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,000
You want to do regression.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,730
That's the regression technique.

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,210
Today we'll talk about unconditional
logistic regression,

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,910
which is what you use when you have
independent observations.

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,260
At the end of the week, I'll also briefly
mention exact logistic regression,

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,450
which is just what it sounds like.

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,650
Logistic regression has an assumption of a
reasonable sample size.

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,460
If you have sparse data, those assumptions
fall down and

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,130
you need, need to use an exact test.

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,740
Similar to the difference between the
chi-squared and the Fisher's exact.

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,890
Alright, so just briefly, what is logistic
regression?

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,380
So recall that we did linear regression in
the fall, if you were in HRP 259.

20
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,870
It looked like you have some continuous
outcome variable, and

21
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,760
then we're modeling that as a linear
function of some predictors.

22
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,640
And it looked, the equation looks
something like that.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,800
Logistic regression looks awfully similar.

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,460
Okay, if you look at the right hand side
of the equation, in fact,

25
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,840
it looks exactly the same.

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,370
So we're essentially trying to do the same
kind of equation as we did with

27
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,840
linear regression, a linear function on
the right hand side of the equation.

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,620
However, because we don't have a
continuous, normally distributed outcome,

29
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,960
we have in the case of logistic regression
a binary or categorical outcome.

30
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,340
The right hand side of the equation's
going to look differently.

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,620
So for a binary outcome it's going to look
like this.

32
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,920
This is what we're going to talk about
today,

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,360
that's something called the logit
function.

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,290
So the outcome looks a little different,
but

35
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,310
notice, the right hand side of the
equation is exactly the same.

36
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,850
So I'm going to walk you through in the
first module this week.

37
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,590
I'm going to walk you through an overview
of this model.

38
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,090
What it means, how to interpret it,

39
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,710
what does the betas mean, what does the
intercept mean.

40
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,710
Then I'm going to walk you through
examples from the literature that

41
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,180
used logistic regression just to talk
about how to interpret those results.

42
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,970
Then at the, towards the end of this week

43
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,710
I'm going to delve into the math behind
logistic regression.

44
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,170
So it is going to get a little bit mathy,

45
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,540
there will be a little bit of calclus
involved.

46
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,040
But I think it's important,

47
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,800
to kind of open up the black box of
logistic regression and

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,820
show you what's behind the scenes, what's
actually going on mathematically.

49
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,250
You will not have to do any of that math
by hand,

50
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,860
buy you need to be able to follow my logic
and understand things like,

51
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,880
what is maximum likelihood estimation, and
what's a likelihood function.

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,230
I'll walk you through all of that.

53
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,290
Just to introduce this week, the, one of
the examples that I'm going to be

54
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,210
using of a real world example in the
medical literature.

55
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,960
It came from a study that was looking at
doctors who had been disciplined by their

56
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,490
state medical board.

57
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,640
So this is an example where logistic
regression came into play because if

58
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,790
you look at the outcome variable, it's a
1/0 variable, it's a binary.

59
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,320
You're either a doctor who was either
disciplined or they weren't.

60
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,900
So if we want to do regression here, we're
going to do a logistic regression.

61
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,180
Now this study happen to be trying to find
out whether or

62
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,460
not there was something in medical school,
that could predict which students were

63
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,000
mostly to go on to become doctors that
were disciplined.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,560
Like if you have say, a low GPA or your
MCAT scores were poor,

65
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,900
if you demonstrated unprofessional
behavior in medical school.

66
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,280
Do any of those things, are any of those
flags that can predict the doctors that

67
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,010
are going to go on to have disciplinary
problems.

68
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,440
You'll notice that the set of predictors
here, they,

69
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,630
there's, they may be very highly
overlapping.

70
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,000
And obviously GPA and MCAT might, scores
might be correlated.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,820
They, those might be related to
unprofessional behavior, and

72
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,190
some of the other things they were looking
at in this study.

73
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,760
So we have a set of predictors that we
want to look at simultaneously to

74
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,000
see which one actually has independent
effects, if any.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,190
And so we're going to need to do some kind
of regression technique, so

76
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,090
that's why we end up doing logistic
regression here.

77
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,060
Now just for interest, I'm just going to
show you a couple of

78
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,860
tables from a few other studies that are
showing you what this outcome is.

79
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,266
What does it mean to be disciplined by the
state medical board?

80
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:06,460
So as background, when we get to this
study that I'm going to present later,

81
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,902
just to show you the kinds of things that
doctors are disciplined for,

82
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:14,080
on the left-hand side, this table here is
showing you,

83
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,174
it's a little bit old, it's from the
1990s, but it's showing you, in the US,

84
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:21,960
some things, negligence, you know,
improper drug prescribing is a big one.

85
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,550
If the doctor has an alcohol abuse
problem,

86
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,599
fraud, sexual misconduct, you know, crime.

87
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:30,750
All of these things are pretty bad things
that you don't want you know,

88
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,260
your doctor to be doing.

89
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,380
The right hand side shows a similar table
from, but

90
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,440
it was data compiled recently from Canada
so you can see

91
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,720
a slightly different distribution, but the
same kinds of behavior.

92
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,320
So these are the kinds of things that
doctors are disciplined for.

93
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,130
And later on this week we're going to look
at what might predict the doctors that

94
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,030
are going to go on to get disciplined.

95
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,210
