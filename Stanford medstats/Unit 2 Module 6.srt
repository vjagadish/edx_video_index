1
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,100
So I've given you two different types of
statistics for talking about

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,980
the relationship between a risk factor, or
a treatment, and a disease.

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,080
Absolute risk differences, and relative
risk differences.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,350
So which of those gives a more clear and

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,288
honest picture of the association between
treatment and exposure or disease?

6
00:00:25,288 --> 00:00:30,010
Turns out that, authors love relative
risks.

7
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,210
They're easy to interpret.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,320
You don't have to worry about units.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,730
They, that's what predominates in the
medical literature.

10
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,690
Unfortunately, relative risks are actually
less informative than absolute risks,

11
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,220
and it's often useful to see the absolute
risks in addition to,

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,050
or instead of, the relative risks.

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,030
Relative risks can mask some things.

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,580
For example, you can have a dramatic
increase or decrease in relative risk that

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,250
corresponds to a very, very tiny increase
or decrease in absolute risk.

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,710
So for example, if the risk in one group
is 0.001% and

17
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,910
the risk in an exposed group is 0.003%.

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,430
If you compare those two groups in terms
of a relative risk,

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,960
it comes out to be a relative risk of 3.

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,480
That sounds large and dramatic.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,790
But if you simply subtract the absolute
risks and you focus on the absolute risks

22
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,535
you can see that the actual increase in
risk is extremely small.

23
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:28,320
0.002% is a really small increase in risk
for a, for an individual.

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,090
So you can see that the picture looks very
different.

25
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,615
Often the relative look, risks look more
dramatic and

26
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:38,442
impressive but the asset risks are most
honest.

27
00:01:38,442 --> 00:01:42,149
So, let's just give you an example here.

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,930
The Women's at Health Initiative was a
large randomized double blind

29
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,280
study looking at the effect of
postmenopausal hormones versus placebo on

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,600
a number of outcomes in postmenopausal
women.

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,650
And this study was run in the late 1990s
and the early 2000s.

32
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,066
And before the study was done, it was
widely believed that.

33
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:06,420
Women, postmenopausal women, benefited
greatly from taking hormones.

34
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,540
In particular it was believed to reduce
the risk of heart disease.

35
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,180
Well that study was actually stopped early
in 2002 because it turned out

36
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,980
that the hormones were more harmful, much
more harmful than anyone expected.

37
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,680
It was.

38
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,590
Expected that the hormones might increase
the risk of breast cancer.

39
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,640
We kind of already knew that, of that
association.

40
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,920
But the data on the heart disease actually
came out exactly the opposite of

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,950
what people were expecting.

42
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,810
It turned out that they were seeing in the
data already that the hormones were

43
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,570
significantly increasing, not protecting
against heart disease but

44
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,380
increasing the risk of heart disease.

45
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,450
So they actually stopped the study early
as a result.

46
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,670
That was pretty pretty big news, because
at the time they

47
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:55,030
stopped that study there were 14 million
women taking post-menopausal hormones.

48
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,610
So you can imagine that they must have
thought very carefully about how to

49
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,130
deliver the message to not only to
physicians, but

50
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,000
to the many women in the public taking
hormones at the time.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,140
And, actually somebody did a really,
really great job in

52
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,390
thinking very carefully about how to
present the risk information.

53
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,760
The media coverage was extremely well
done, and this had, largely had to do

54
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,050
with the fact that the press release that
was released about the study to the media.

55
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,810
They, they talked about the risks in a
very particular way, and

56
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,270
the media ended up just repeating what was
in the press release.

57
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,900
And, and it went like this.

58
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,400
They said the data indicate that if 10,000
women take the drugs for

59
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,012
a year, eight more will develop invasive
breast caner,

60
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:42,160
compared with 10,000 who were not taking
hormone replacement therapy.

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,450
Notice they are presenting, presenting the
incidence rates,

62
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,940
the difference in incidence rates.

63
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,800
They're presenting everything also
everything in whole numbers, which is,

64
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,020
you know, again, easier for people to
understand.

65
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,850
An additional seven will have a heart
attack,

66
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,880
eight will have a stroke, and 18 will have
fewer well, blood clots, but there

67
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,870
will be six fewer colorectal cancers and
few, five fewer hip fractures so, they're

68
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,500
also presenting the data on on the things
that were beneficial from the hormone.

69
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,240
So, this was very well done coverage.

70
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,380
It's very unusual because if you look at

71
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,180
the media coverage most of the medical
literature you'll see that they

72
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,160
almost always talk about relative risks
and not, and not absolute risks.

73
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,360
And that's not really the, the fault of
the media necessarily.

74
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,988
That's just the way that these data are
usually presented in medical studies.

75
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:30,150
So just to, to drill down a little bit
more on,

76
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,550
on the data from this study, so if you
looked at breast cancer,

77
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,320
you can see that the rate of breast cancer
in the hormone group,

78
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,490
the incidence rate was 38 breast cancer
cases per 10,000 women-years.

79
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,010
In the placebo group, that rate was 30 per
10,000.

80
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,155
So the rate difference was eight
additional breast cancer cases per

81
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:47,360
10,000 women years.

82
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,360
So that's exactly what they presented in
the press release.

83
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,830
However, if you look at the paper, the
paper presented that information.

84
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,210
It also presented the relative risk.

85
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,364
And the relative risk here was 1.26.

86
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,970
The interpretation would be that there

87
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,580
was a 26% increase in the risk of breast
cancer on women taking hormones.

88
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,720
You can see that that's a very different
message if you, if the,

89
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,630
if the press release and the media had
told women that there

90
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,240
was a 26% increase in their risk, that
sounds much more dramatic.

91
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,670
It's not that the number is wrong, it's,
that's the true increase in relative risk.

92
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,120
But, if you look at the absolute risk
numbers, you can see that the risk to

93
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,640
any individual woman is actually really,
really small.

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,340
Imagine if a woman hears that she has a
26% increased risk of breast cancer,

95
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,160
that sounds very impressive and scary.

96
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,670
But in fact, her increase or absolute
increase in risk is just 0.08% per year.

97
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,740
So eight out of 10,000 is 0.08%, so it's
actually a very,

98
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,020
very small increase in risk in, for any
particular, one particular woman.

99
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,390
You can see how different the message
looks depending on

100
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,630
whether you give the relative risk versus
the absolute risk.

101
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,560
For heart attacks, the numbers are very
similar with 37 per 10,000 in

102
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,870
the hormone group, 30 per 10,000 in the
placebo group.

103
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,520
So seven additional heart attacks per
10,000 women-years.

104
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,016
But again, the relative risk, if you look
at it as a relative risk.

105
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:10,168
Is 1.29.

106
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:15,520
That again looks much more dramatic, but
in fact a much more honest presentation of

107
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,230
the risks would be to say, to look at the
absolute risk differences, or the absolute

108
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:23,420
rate difference here, 0.07% again is not
really a big increase in risk.

109
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,600
We can also calculate from this data, just
to practice, the number needed to harm.

110
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,490
So, we have the absolute rate differences.

111
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,880
And as, as, I told you before, the number
needed to harm you can

112
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,020
calculate by just doing the reciprocal of
the rate difference.

113
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,680
So, if it's seven additional heart attacks
are going to occur when you

114
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,750
treat 10,000 women with hormones for one
year.

115
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,070
Then to harm one woman, you would need to,
so

116
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,088
it's better to harm seven than to harm
one, you would divide 10,000 by 7 to

117
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:56,305
get that you would have to treat 1,429
women with hormones.

118
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:59,260
In order to have one additional heart
attack you would have to

119
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,650
treat a 1250 women with

120
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:07,240
post menopausal hormones in order to have
one additional case of breast cancer.

121
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,740
So presenting it in that number needed to
treat.

122
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,750
Number needed to harm picture also helps
people to put that risk into perspective.

123
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,720
Now this is, that's a pretty high number
needed to harm, or number needed to treat.

124
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,340
But remember, if you have 14 million women
on hormones,

125
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,610
that translates to several thousand cases
of heart attacks.

126
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,670
And thousand, several thousand breast
cancer cases per year.

127
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,390
So the risk to any individual woman is
small here, but

128
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,890
the risk to society is large.

129
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,420
So, just think about all of these things
when you're presenting risk and

130
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,370
talking about risk.

131
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,150
First of all, most people have an easier
time understanding whole numbers than

132
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,510
percentages and decimals.

133
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,840
So it's great to always try to translate
things into whole numbers.

134
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,880
Absolute risks give a more accurate
picture of the true risk than

135
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,600
relative risks.

136
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,620
Relative risks can look really dramatic
even when the absolute risk

137
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,040
increase isn't, isn't very big.

138
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,710
And then the other take home message from
this study is that,

139
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,340
interestingly, you know, the public health
risk can be large even when the risk to

140
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,580
a given individual is small.

141
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,820
So sometimes, depending on whether you're
looking from the societal perspective or

142
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,820
the individual perspective, those risks
may, you know,

143
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,270
the risk picture may be different.
