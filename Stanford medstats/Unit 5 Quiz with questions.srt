1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,900
The correct answer for this is D.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,718
On a T-distribution we are not guaranteed
that 95% of the area will fall within 2

3
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:12,952
standard deviations of the mean, even
though this is a fact for

4
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:16,990
the normal distribution.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,955
This isn't proof for a T-distribution.

6
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:22,460
Especially for when we have a small number
of observations.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,644
The answer is true,

8
00:00:23,644 --> 00:00:28,084
because the researchers measured what
really the entire population we

9
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:35,355
can safely say that this is a true value
and there is no sample statistic involved.

10
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:36,836
The correct answer is b.

11
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:40,478
The standard is a measure of variability
of the sample statistic.

12
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:46,751
A is incorrect because the formula given
in a is valid only for

13
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:52,040
the standard area for mean.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,190
But we could have standard errors of a lot
of other statistics as well.

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,996
For example, we could have standard errors
for mo-modes and medians, and

16
00:00:58,996 --> 00:01:02,298
the formula for that would not be the
formula given in it.

17
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:06,010
Meanwhile, we know that the formula for
the Standard Error in a mean is

18
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:12,129
the standard deviation divided by the
square root of the number of observations.

19
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,464
In this case our standard deviation is 10.

20
00:01:15,464 --> 00:01:23,310
We have 400 observations, we see that the
standard data comes out to be 0.5.

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,760
The correct answer for this question is B.

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,152
The size of the smallest group, and

23
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:29,480
we can illustrate that using a very simple
example.

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:37,930
Let's say we have a case where a was 1, b
was 10, c was 100 and d was 1,000.

25
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:43,082
We can see that of all expressions in the
formula come out to be one by

26
00:01:43,082 --> 00:01:47,780
one plus .1 plus .01 plus .001.

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,647
And we can see that the first expression
is the one that are going to impact

28
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:52,770
the standard error the most.

29
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,490
The correct answer here is d.

30
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,520
Different statistics have different
forcumlas for standard errors.

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,685
We know that the formula for standard
error of the mean.

32
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:06,940
It is given by the standard deviation
divided by the square root of

33
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,990
the number of observations, but this is
only the formula for

34
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,260
the standard error of the mean.

35
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,200
We have very different formulas for the
standard errors or

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,700
the mean, the modes, the median for
example.

37
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,770
The answer to this question is d, all of
the above.

38
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,322
The confidence interval gives us
information about the effect size,

39
00:02:24,322 --> 00:02:26,880
the precision and the statistical
significance.

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,160
The correct answer is a, changing from a
99 to a 95% confidence level.

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
Because [INAUDIBLE] lower level of
Confidence decreases the rate of of

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,090
the confidence interval.

43
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,072
A 95% confidence interval of a mean will
include the true

44
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:46,680
population mean 95% of the time.

45
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,770
This is true by the definition of the
confidence interval.

46
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,258
If we sample both women and men together
we would have a higher standard deviation

47
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:57,284
of heights because we would expect the men
to be Taller than the women,

48
00:02:57,284 --> 00:03:01,508
is the only sample of women we would
expect the heights to be closer together,

49
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:08,180
because of which the standard deviation
would be lower.

50
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,860
The first confidence interval would be
narrow,

51
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,340
narrower because it involved a larger
sample size.

52
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:19,312
We know that the formula for the margin of
error is,

53
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:26,616
one by the square root of the number of
observations,

54
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:33,870
which comes out to 4%.

55
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,960
In this case, we know that the mean is
55%.

56
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:44,680
In the previous question, we calculated
that when we have 625 observations,

57
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,710
the margin of error is 4%.

58
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,310
So if we want to find the lower and upper
bound for

59
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:00,630
a 95% interval, this would be 55% plus or
minus 4%.

60
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,420
The lower bound would be 55% minus 4%,
which is 51.

61
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:12,450
And the upper bound would be 55% plus 4%,
which is 59%.

62
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,210
The correct answer is b.

63
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,370
Because the smallest standard error will
result in a smaller p value.

64
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,730
The correct answer here is d.

65
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,830
There is not enough evidence to reject the
null hypothesis.

66
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,262
A is incorrect because we have failed to
prove that the treatments differ but

67
00:04:29,262 --> 00:04:32,200
this is not equivalent to proving the
treatments are the same.

68
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,512
B is incorrect because we were not given
enough information about whether the drug

69
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:39,330
in the placebo improved the insomnia
symptoms.

70
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,378
C is incorrect because the high value,

71
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:46,230
P value shows us that we cannot reject the
null hypothesis [SOUND].

72
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,910
In this question the correct answer is C.

73
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,790
There is only 2% chance that the observed
difference in cure rates could have

74
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,990
arisen if the drug had no effect.

75
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,520
This is by the definition of the B value.
