2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,130
In this next module, I'm going to tell you
about negative binomial regression,

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,580
which is just an extension of Poisson
Regression.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,100
So negative binomial regression is also
used in a situation where you

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,250
have Count data.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,110
It's a lot like poisson regression,

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,450
except you're going to estimate one
additional parameter.

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,010
But that additional parameter can be
pretty important.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,590
So the parameter that you're estimating is
something called the dispersion parameter.

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,930
And here's why you might need that.

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,988
So when you did a poisson regression, you
were assuming.

12
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:41,200
That the data actually had

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,350
a Poisson probability distribution that it
actually followed that.

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,500
Remember with the Poisson probability
distribution, the mean and

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,070
the variance are equivalent.

16
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,030
It turns out that with a lot of real life
count data, that is not true,

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,520
the mean and the variance are not
equivalent,

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,380
in fact the variance, Can be quite a bit
bigger than the mean.

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,660
If that's the case, then our data are what
we call over-dispersed.

20
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,500
And Poisson probability isn't quite the
right fit.

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,350
We have to correct for this dispersion,
for

22
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,800
the fact that the variance is actually
bigger than the mean.

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,790
We can do that by estimating an additional
parameter.

24
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,150
Called the dispersion parameter.

25
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,050
Now, what's the consequences of pretending
we're on

26
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,000
a Poisson distribution when in fact the
mean is smaller than the variance?

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,570
Well, what would happen in that case, we
run a Poisson regression,

28
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,970
we're assuming that the variance is
smaller than it actually is,

29
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,260
and therefore all of our estimates of
standard error are going to be too small.

30
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,050
And therefor, our p values are going to be
too small, and

31
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,910
we're going to have an overly optimistic
model.

32
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,230
So if you don't estimate this dispersion
parameter when it's needed,

33
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,630
your model might be overly optimistic.

34
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,740
My general recommendation actually is
you're going to see in

35
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,550
a minute that it's fairly straight forward
to run the negative binomial regression.

36
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,690
You can always run the negative binomial
regression for count data.

37
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,970
It will tell you, essentially, weather or
not you need this dispersion term.

38
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,460
If you don't need the dispersion term,

39
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,400
you can default back to the Poisson
regression.

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,250
If you do need it, then you can stick with
the negative binomial.

41
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,460
So then my general approach would actually
be, with count data,

42
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,920
to start with the negative binomial
regression, and then default to

43
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,730
Poisson only if the dispersion clu-,
parameter's close to zero.

44
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,480
Just as, a, just a quick note here, I
want to mention that,

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,160
we are, negative binomial, that's the
another probability distribution.

46
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,160
So, I am not going to go into a lot of
details about it but the negative

47
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,620
binomial probability distribution works
again, the probability distribution.

48
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,910
Therefore, we can use it to do regression
and just to like you know.

49
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,330
A sense of what it is, is a situation like
this.

50
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,490
So imagine you got a coin, and

51
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,880
you say I'm going to flip this coin until
I get 50 heads.

52
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,630
So I'm going to stop when I get 50 heads.

53
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,230
You can ask the question then, well how
long, how many flips of

54
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,910
the coin are you going to have to do
before you stop, before you hit 50 heads?

55
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,380
And of course.

56
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,190
On a given try, it might take you 80 flips
of a coin.

57
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,440
It might take you a 100.

58
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,110
It might take you a 120.

59
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,050
So, we can talk about the probability of
each of those possible outcomes.

60
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,950
So, whether it takes you 90 coin flips
before you get 50 heads or

61
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,510
whether it takes you a 110.

62
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,300
We can actually calculate all of this
probabilities.

63
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,690
Those probabilities follows what's

64
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,090
called a negative Binomial probability
distribution.

65
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,440
Turns out that the negative binomials
related to both the binomial and

66
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,190
to the Poisson and and that's as much
detailed as I'll, I'll go into there.

67
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,910
But let me actually just give you a real
example.

68
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,060
So, go back to the data that I had on the
number of swimming world records that

69
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,820
are set in a given year.

70
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,210
We fit all that data with a Poisson
regression.

71
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,440
But actually that probably wasn't optimal,
because if you look carefully at

72
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,410
that outcome variable here, it is in fact
over-dispersed.

73
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,390
The variance of the number of world
records in a given year is

74
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,600
actually bigger than the mean.

75
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,190
So that indicates that we should probably
try a negative binomial regression here,

76
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,380
and that's indeed what I did.

77
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,970
So let me just remind you what the Poisson
regression model we ended up with

78
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,060
was the following.

79
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,050
So this came out of Poisson regression, we
had Ended with a model of year,

80
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,900
year squared, number of new technologies,
and

81
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,620
the interaction between year and number of
new technologies.

82
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,880
Something that's hidden here is that we
set the dispersion parameter to zero.

83
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,160
So we're saying we're not allowing for any
dispersion.

84
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,370
The only difference you're going to see
with the negative binomial is

85
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,310
that we'll actually estimate this, we
won't set it to zero.

86
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,240
What you're going to pay attention to in
the output here,

87
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,370
is just kind of scan the Poisson
regression model that we've got,

88
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,720
look at the beta coefficients, And then
also look at the standard errors.

89
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,860
What's going to happen when we do a
negative binomial is

90
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,790
that the beta coefficients aren't going to
change much at all.

91
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,860
because this doesn't really effect the
beta coefficients at all it

92
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,370
simply effects the variants or the
standard error.

93
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,527
However, look carefully at the standard
errors they are about .01,

94
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:48,310
.004, .1086, .0036 Those standard errors
are going to get a lot bigger,

95
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,140
when we account for dispersion.

96
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,880
So now let me show you the negative
binomial regression for the same data.

97
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,370
Same model, same data.

98
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,300
So notice now first focus on this
dispersion parameter.

99
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,440
We've estimated this additional parameter,
that's called the dispersion parameter.

100
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,120
Came out with a value of positive ,1654
and we also get a standard error for

101
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,470
this dispersion parameter.

102
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,360
Notice if I divide the point estimate by
its standard error here,

103
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,120
I'm going to get assuming this is normally
distributed, I'm going to get a Z score.

104
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,450
You know, of above three, it's going to be
highly statistically significant.

105
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,210
That's telling me that the dispersion is
different than zero.

106
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,740
There is dispersion.

107
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,240
That means I need to account for it.

108
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,470
If I had fit the negative binomial
regression and

109
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,500
the dispersion value had come out close to
zero And

110
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,880
you know wasn't statistically significant,
then I would say Poisson regression model

111
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,100
is good enough, it doesn't look like it
have a lot of dispersion.

112
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,380
So you can actually fit the negative
binomial, check the dispersion parameter,

113
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,340
if its close to zero, go with Poisson, if
its away from zero as is it here,

114
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,470
then go with the negative binomial.

115
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,420
Notice, that you actually look at the
betas, they don't change much,

116
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,730
they're almost identical to what we got
from From plus on.

117
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,890
So this does not effect the point
estimates.

118
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,220
However, look over here at the standard
errors.

119
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,720
We had about .01 before that's more than
doubled, we had .04 that's now .008.

120
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,160
A lot of that, they're almost all either
nearly doubled or, or doubled.

121
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,150
So the standard errors are quite a bit
bigger that's going to

122
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,710
make a huge impact on the p-values.

123
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,390
So you'll notice that all of the p-values
are smaller than they were.

124
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:21,080
This new technology, linear term, is no
longer significant.

125
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,270
And the year squared term is kind of only
borderline.

126
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,200
All of them were significant before.

127
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,570
This is important because it can really
effect the p-values.

128
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,550
Just for fun, I also took this data,

129
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,490
because sometimes you get data and you're
not quite sure which model to put them in.

130
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,540
So you have to go through this thought
process.

131
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,510
I also took these count data and because
if you plot them in a histogram,

132
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,600
you realize that they're, you know,
there's a, there's a fair range here.

133
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,620
Perhaps, we can make these a little bit
normally distributed if we apply a log.

134
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,790
And so, you could try to kind of force
these data in a linear regression and

135
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,480
I did that just to show you what happens.

136
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,180
So I took the log count data because
that's more normally distributed than

137
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,690
the count data.

138
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,390
Although, still not perfectly normally
distributed.

139
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,410
And I ran it with a regular old linear
regression, same model.

140
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,760
And here's the outcome that I get.

141
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,740
So notice, first of all,

142
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,680
that the beta coefficients are almost
identical to what we saw before.

143
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,760
So no matter which of these models you
choose,

144
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,610
your basically getting the same beta
coefficients.

145
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,860
So that's good.

146
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,310
What changes is the standard error.

147
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,990
So the standard errors here are now
actually a little bit higher than with,

148
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,850
the optimal model, which is negative
binomial regression.

149
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,860
The standard error is a little higher, so
the p values are even Even bigger.

150
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,560
And we're going to miss some things that
actually are statistically significant

151
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,120
in the negative binomial regression.

152
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,780
So, the linear regression turns out to be
overly conservative for these data.

153
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,020
So, if you had forced this into a linear
regression,

154
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,640
you might have missed something.

155
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,790
So, with count data, it's probably best to
just start with the negative binomial.

156
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,150
And then if you want to get simpler from
there, you know if you don't need

157
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,490
the dispersion parameter, or you could try
a linear regression if it looks like you,

158
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,000
really the counts are really filling in
all the wide range that aren't

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,090
normally distributed, but often with
counts, they're not normally distributed.

160
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,970
So with counts, think of negative binomial
or plasan.

161
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:13,710
And then finally, I just want to mention
that as with the plasan regression.

162
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,940
You can take the data co-efficients from a
negative binomial regression and

163
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,840
they have a direct interpretation as
relative risks.

164
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,290
So, if you just exponentiate the data
co-efficients from

165
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,880
negative binomial regression.

166
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,040
That's going to give you the incidence
rate ratio, same as with Poisson.

167
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,020
So, everything is identical.

168
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,760
I want to give you an example here or

169
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,560
a model is a little complicated because I
have got all Interaction in

170
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,330
a higher order terms, but let me walk you
through one calculation.

171
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,800
So, for example, our beta for

172
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,707
the number of new technologies, that was
negative .27.

173
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:50,410
Our beta for the interaction between
technologies is And

174
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,090
year turned out to be positive 0.015,

175
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:58,650
and remember that I've modeled years here
as the number of years since 1969.

176
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:04,890
So how would I get the incidence rate
ratio for new technology Well, of course,

177
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,800
because of an interaction term that means
that this rate ratio depends on the year

178
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,770
that we're talking about, technology has a
different effect depending on the year.

179
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:18,000
The easiest one to calculate it for is if
I just look at 1969.

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,640
So if I look at 1969 the interaction term
will go to 0 because I've modeled

181
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,750
this as year since 1969 so that will have
a value, year will have a value of 0.

182
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,590
This interaction term will go away.

183
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,580
So at, in 1969, the ri, the risk ratio,
the rate ratio for new

184
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,820
technologies was e raised to the negative
0.27 which is a risk ratio of 0.76.

185
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,900
So introducing a new technology in 1969
had little effect, if anything, it,

186
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,760
there were less world records when that
happened.

187
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,845
However, scroll ahead 40 years later to
2009.

188
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:51,870
[UNKNOWN].

189
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,560
What are we going to get in our model.

190
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,700
So our risk ratio's going to be negative
.27 but

191
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,840
now we get the interaction term so I'm
doing this very one, one new technology so

192
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,220
technology will be one, I'm going to
multiply it by 40, 40 years since 1969.

193
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,975
The beta co-efficient here was .015.

194
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,200
.015 time 40 is .60.

195
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,550
This is going to, if I add .60 minus .27 I
get e raised to .33 so

196
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,040
the odd, the relative risk here is 1.39.

197
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:26,710
So if you're talking about 2009 than every
new technology

198
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:31,310
increases your weight of world records or
your risk of world records by 39%.

199
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,000
So new technologies are having a really
big impact in the later Four years.

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,770
That's what the interaction term tells us.

201
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,710
But again with negative binomial, there's
a nice, easy, you can get out these,

202
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,150
these rate ratios better than odds ratios
as, as we know.
