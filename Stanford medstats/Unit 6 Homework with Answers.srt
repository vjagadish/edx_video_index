1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:06,492
This question compared the effect of
calcipotral cream versus ultra based cream

2
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:09,850
on the reduction of skin lesions.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,782
We had p values of .017 for

4
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:18,733
the calcipotral cream versus p value of
.056 for the ultrabase base.

5
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:23,561
The answer to the first question is D, the
difference between the creams may not be

6
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:28,247
significantly different even though the p
value for one is less than .05 and for

7
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:32,658
the other is greater than .05.

8
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,630
It appears that there was some reduction
on the placebo side.

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,284
That would just missed statistical
significance because we know that the p

10
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:42,317
value is slightly greater than .05.

11
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:47,502
It's unlikely that the between group
difference will be significant here.

12
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:50,621
The next question asked us the unit of
observation for the study.

13
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:55,366
Because we were studying the side of a
face, that is the unit of observation and

14
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:59,150
that's the answer to this question.

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,505
This study does involve correlated
observations because we are studying two

16
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:09,115
sides of the same person's face and these
obviously will be correlated.

17
00:01:09,115 --> 00:01:12,289
This question has the authors running a
lot of tests, so

18
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:17,651
they have 15 different levels of black
tea, coffee, decaf coffee.

19
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:20,030
They have two diseases [UNKNOWN].

20
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,450
They also have two types of participants,
pre menopausal versus postmenopausal.

21
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,235
In such a large number of test that are
run,

22
00:01:27,235 --> 00:01:31,700
we would expect to find a few p values
that are less than .05 just by chance.

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,835
The fact that we have a couple of values
that are less than .05 does not

24
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:38,205
reflect actual correlation in this case.

25
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:43,107
Because this study examined individual
women,

26
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:48,630
the unit of observation here is a person.

27
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,410
The observations in this study are not
correlated.

28
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,226
This is because this study examined
independent women.

29
00:01:54,226 --> 00:01:56,848
This question gives us the increased risk
for

30
00:01:56,848 --> 00:02:02,062
various diseases comparing two groups,
exposed versus unexposed.

31
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:06,576
We can see that the, the risk ratios in
case B and D are very close to one,

32
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:13,310
which tells us that these are not really
very clinically significant.

33
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,656
And thus the answer to this question is A,

34
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:21,320
C and E where we actually do see a
significant departure from 1.

35
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,391
For the risk ratios to be statistically
significant at a .05 level.

36
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:32,940
We should have the confidence intervals
such that one does not cross them.

37
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,745
Which means that one should either be
lower than the lower bound or

38
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:38,769
one should be greater than the upper
bound.

39
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:41,695
The only two cases for which this is true,
is A and B.

40
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:45,353
Thus these are the only risk ratios that
are statistically significant at

41
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:46,800
a .05 level.
