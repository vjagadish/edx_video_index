1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,230
[BLANK_AUDIO].

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,260
In this next module I'm going to talk
about time-changing predictors in

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,420
mixed models.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,390
And the interpretation is actually
going to be very similar to when we

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,470
had time-changing predictors in
generalized estimating equations.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,119
So, this module should be largely review.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,760
So we're going to use this same old data
set that I used last week.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,900
This had six subjects.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,657
And they all were given a drug that's
supposed to make a happy chemical in,

10
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:29,970
in their brain go up.

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,090
And you can see that's what's happening.

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,510
And then they had their depression scores
measured over time.

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,870
They were all depressed subjects.

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,140
I graphed this data for you last week.

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,640
The overall graphic look like this.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,840
Indeed, it look like on average, people's
happy chemical level was indeed going up,

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,549
and on average, the depression scores were
going down somewhat.

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,710
So I'll show you here the SAS code.

19
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,790
So, this was I fit first a model with just
a random intercept in it.

20
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,160
And here is the results from that model in
SAS.

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,330
So just to go through the output,

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,230
you can see that I got my variants for the
intercepts.

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,940
That's 35.3.

24
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,870
That's my between subject variability at
baseline, my residual variance.

25
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,230
My AIC here is 147.2, just keep that in
mind.

26
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,010
And then you get down to the actual model,
the parameter estimates.

27
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,830
And you'll see that it's very similar to
what we got when we

28
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,550
did this with a generalized estimating
equation.

29
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,300
So the time effect is not statistically
significant.

30
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,020
The chemical effect is highly
statistically significant, and

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,960
as before, since chemical is a time
changing predictor,

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,280
we do not put in a chemical by time
interaction.

33
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,680
Time is already inherent in chemical
because it's a time changing predictor.

34
00:01:47,898 --> 00:01:52,385
The beta coefficient for chemical is
negative 0.129.

35
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:54,050
So almost exactly the same a what we got
out of

36
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,580
the generalized estimating equation.

37
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,990
It's highly statistically significant.

38
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,726
The interpretation of that beta
coefficient is tricky,

39
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:04,944
as we talked about last week, because it
encompasses both within subject's effects,

40
00:02:04,944 --> 00:02:06,820
and between subjects effects.

41
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,010
So I can't tell you just by looking at
that beta coefficient whether or

42
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:14,470
not any two people who differ in their
chemical level will also be predicted to

43
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,450
differ in the depression level.

44
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,674
Or, whether a person whose individual
chemical level goes up

45
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:22,278
whether that will correlate to their, you
know,

46
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:26,850
whether they will be predicted to have
their individual depression score go down.

47
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,430
It could be both of those or some
combination of those.

48
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,675
We saw last week that with this particular
data set, which is made up,

49
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:36,020
that mostly this was within, due to within
subjects' effects.

50
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,350
But, again, the interpretation than no
different than, than we did last week.

51
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,040
I'll also note that the estimates here of
the beta coefficient and the P-values

52
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,120
are really similar to what we got out of
the generalized estimating equation.

53
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,332
I also ran this model with both a random
intercept and

54
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:57,820
a random time slope just to see if there
is if one model was better than the other.

55
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,490
So here's the output from that model.

56
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,803
You'll see that the AIC is 149.5.

57
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:05,890
So a, we actually did a little worse by
including the random time slope here.

58
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,670
So we would probably just choose the model
that had the random intercept only.

59
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,290
And we've seen that that often is a good
fit for these types of data.

60
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,460
I do want to point out one thing here that
I haven't mentioned.

61
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:23,598
Which is that if you're running a mixed
model with a random intercept

62
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:30,330
only [SOUND] that is sort of conceptually
equivalent to running a marginal model,

63
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:36,666
either a GE model or, a mixed model with a
repeated statement a marginal

64
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:41,913
model where you choose the exchangeable
correlation matrix or

65
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:45,873
the compound symmetry covariance
structure,

66
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:51,260
[SOUND] as your correlation structure for
the residuals.

67
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,400
So those are actually, those actually
converge on one another.

68
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,320
You should get very similar results if you
run those two models.
