1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,920
This is the first video of a series of
modules that will explain how to

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,590
use a Deducer.

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,920
Which is a graphical user interface for

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,520
the program R to conduct your statistical
analysis.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,890
R is a really powerful statistical
program, but for

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,400
those who have never coded before it can
be quite challenging.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,070
What Deducer does is it creates a
graphical user interface, or

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,140
a gooey, for R users.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,430
That simplify a lot of the coding that you
would otherwise need to learn.

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,224
This first module, we'll go over how to
download and install these

11
00:00:45,224 --> 00:00:49,800
programs onto your computer so that you
can use them in the subsequent exercises.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,327
So let's begin.

13
00:00:51,327 --> 00:00:58,760
The first step is to open up your Internet
browser and go to www.deducer.org.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,380
OK.

15
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:08,090
And then click on Download and Install in
the middle of the screen here.

16
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,984
And there are three different options for
different operating environments.

17
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:15,910
This computer that I'm working on is a
Windows machine.

18
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,111
So I'm going to click on Windows.

19
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:20,879
And then I'm going to click on Download
Installer.

20
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:27,193
So a few things I want to say while we're
waiting for this installer to download.

21
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:28,690
One is that all the,

22
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,305
instructions in this video are in written
form posted on the class website.

23
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:38,793
So, if that's easier or faster for you,
please follow the instructions there.

24
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:40,587
The other is that.

25
00:01:40,587 --> 00:01:43,930
Deducer will require Java to run on your
machine, so

26
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:49,280
if you don't have Java, you're going to
need to install that first.

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,820
So it looks like the installer is
complete, so

28
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,200
I'm going to click on that and hit Run.

29
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,830
Want English, going to click Next, Next,
Next.

30
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,380
It's telling me where, it wants to install
R,

31
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,225
which is basically the statistical engine
that Deducer is going to run through.

32
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:13,710
OK, R already exists on this machine, so

33
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,860
this prompt comes up, it should not come
up.

34
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,870
When you're installing R on your computer.

35
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,730
I'm going to hit Yes.

36
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,180
I'm going to hit Next.

37
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,130
One thing I do want to point out is that
if you're on a Windows machine and

38
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,550
you're using the installer, then Java is
included in this package.

39
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,889
So, this package should have everything
that you need.

40
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,690
I do not want to customize, the
installation.

41
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,520
And I'm just going to keep clicking next.

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,660
I'm going to leave, Create a desktop icon,
checked.

43
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:50,343
don't really want a quick launch icon.

44
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:56,080
And that's that.

45
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,110
I do want to point out while we're waiting
for this to install,

46
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,120
that there are instructions for existing R
users in the background here,

47
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,345
on the Chrome page where we downloaded the
installer.

48
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:10,820
So for those of you with R already on your
machine,

49
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,670
you should feel free to update R first.

50
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:22,510
And then install the correct packages, in
order to run Deducer.

51
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,080
Okay, so the Java runtime environment has
been found.

52
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,690
That's because deducer's uh,been on this
computer before.

53
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,675
This should not come up for if you're
installing this for the first time.

54
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:35,984
So it looks like it's completed.

55
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:42,720
What I'm going to do is minimize this for
now and then go to the Deducer shortcut.

56
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,660
So this is what it looks like on the
screen here.

57
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:51,670
I'm going to double-click that, and I see
two windows pop up here.

58
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,820
So one's called the console.

59
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,275
And one's called the data viewer.

60
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:56,570
Okay.

61
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,680
So the first thing I want to do is select
Packages in data.

62
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,395
And then go to package manager.

63
00:04:02,395 --> 00:04:07,110
And the reason why I want to do that is
because I want to select,

64
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,020
the check boxes next to Deducer extras.

65
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,630
Again, what I did was I went to Packages
in data.

66
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,305
I selected package manager.

67
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:21,302
Okay and I selected the check boxes under
the columns, default, and loaded.

68
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:25,621
So both checkboxes next to Deducer extras.

69
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:31,210
And what that's going to do is create a
whole nother menu for us,

70
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:37,640
that offers, statistical tests and options
that we didn't have before.

71
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,610
So we're going to be using those in the
exercises, so

72
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,875
it's a good idea to just include that
right now.

73
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,250
So believe it or not, that's it.

74
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,610
Now you have Deducer and R both running on
your computer.

75
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,850
So now that we've installed R and Deducer.

76
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,400
Let's try to open up the class data and
see what it looks like.

77
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,950
So, not shown here, but I've gone to the
class website and downloaded this

78
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,560
Excel spreadsheet called mock class data,
and saved it to my desktop.

79
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,240
So what I want to do now is click on the
open data icon in the data viewer window,

80
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,460
on the right-hand side of the screen here,
and then navigate towards the desktop,

81
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,440
or wherever you saved mock class data, and
hit Open.

82
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,899
And I want, there's only one worksheet.

83
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,560
[INAUDIBLE] here with data, so I'm just
going to hit Ok.

84
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,230
And here we go.

85
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:37,230
So the data has been loaded.

86
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,450
There should be 50 rows.

87
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,030
Good.
It's always good to check your data and

88
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,270
look across it to make sure everything's
been loaded correctly.

89
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,060
And so just scrolling left and

90
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,800
right and up and down, I see that
everything's been loaded.

91
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,400
And you're essentially ready to go at this
point.

92
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,060
So if you,

93
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,930
a few things that I want to point out
before you jump in the exercises.

94
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,355
There are two tabs here data view and
variable view.

95
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:04,950
Data view is the spread sheet view it's
almost like you're

96
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,440
looking at an Excel Spreadsheet or
something like that.

97
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,620
You can directly change data here by
clicking on random cells.

98
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,100
So please be very very careful that you
don't do that.

99
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,331
okay.
I was just demonstrating that by

100
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:24,560
selecting random cells and hitting
numbers.

101
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,580
In variable view, in this tab we see a
list of all of

102
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,840
the variables in the data set as well as
their type.

103
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,840
So, variable types can range between a few
things.

104
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,075
So you can have character variables which
are otherwise known as strings.

105
00:06:38,075 --> 00:06:45,800
So letters essentially are the conventions
actually is just

106
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,445
keep all variables that you don't plan on
doing any math on as character variables.

107
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:58,568
So, things like zip codes or reference
numbers.

108
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:00,130
Is things like that.

109
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,260
That you don't want to do math on.

110
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,210
Even if they're numbers you generally
want to make them character variables.

111
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,210
Just to prevent any mistakes from
happening.

112
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,150
Now things like age where you might
want to take the average of it in

113
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,340
your data set.

114
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,420
You can keep those as a numeric varialbe.

115
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,600
And the numeric variables here are double
and integer.

116
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,810
Factor is r's way of describing a
categorical variable.

117
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:30,660
And you'll also notice that there are
different options for

118
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:37,150
date and time variables ,okay?

119
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,720
You can have multiple data sets open at
the same time.

120
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,560
And the way to navigate between them is to
click on

121
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,760
the drop-down underneath Data Set in the
center.

122
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,260
And I only have one data set open, so

123
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,330
only one drops down here, but you can
image having two or three open.

124
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,600
And that's essentially the data of your
window.

125
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,320
The console window is where you're

126
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,305
going to have more of your meaty
statistical options.

127
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:08,720
So the tabs that we're going to be using
in our exercises are the Data tab.

128
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,510
The Analysis tab, the Plots tab, and the
Extras tab.

129
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,019
Okay.

130
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:22,330
So these 4 tabs are going to have 95% of
everything that we're interested in.

131
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,670
One last thing I want to note before
ending the video is

132
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:31,950
that sometimes you might have an issue
importing an Excel file.

133
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,819
The first time that you run reducer.

134
00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:39,840
And if that's the case that's the case
there's a little there's a little trick.

135
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:46,190
So, for Windows, Windows users, what you
can do is type in a certain command,

136
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,990
so that is, and I'll show you here.

137
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,925
Type in

138
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:59,925
install.packages("XLConnect")

139
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,110
So if you hit that, this [INAUDIBLE] will
come up.

140
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:10,210
Just select USA and then the state that
you're closest to,

141
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,700
or really where ever in the world you're
closest to.

142
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,150
And hit OK to download and install that
package.

143
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,265
And that package is going to help you
import Excel files.

144
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:24,280
Okay?

145
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,960
If you're on a Mac and you experience the
same problem it's similar code.

146
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,420
But it's a little more involved.

147
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,740
So you want to Basically do the same
thing.

148
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,590
Type in install.packages("rJava").

149
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,070
So run that.

150
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,700
Hit Enter.

151
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,070
I'm not going to do it here.

152
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:47,995
Here and then one more.

153
00:09:47,995 --> 00:09:54,020
So do install.packages again.

154
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,890
And then ("XLConnect" like we did before,

155
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,845
except this time you're also going to also
put in comma space

156
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:08,845
type=

157
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,610
Open quote source and close quote, close
parentheses.

158
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,965
So, and hit enter.

159
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:19,690
Okay?

160
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:27,392
So that should install this package that
you need to import Excel files.

161
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:31,550
Now if your R is up to date, and your
Deducer is up to date and you're

162
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,010
using the most up to date packages for
everything, this should not be a problem.

163
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,120
But this is something that commonly
happens so

164
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,200
I just wanted to show this in the video
just in case.

165
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,920
Okay, so that wraps up the download and
installation video.

166
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:54,901
Hope that was helpful.
