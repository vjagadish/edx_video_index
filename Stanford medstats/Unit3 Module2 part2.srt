1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,310
Sometimes, you may want to look at the
distribution of a subset of the data.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,980
We can do this with a where statement,
just like we used to do with data steps.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,370
Take a look at this code.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,810
Similar to the example we just went over,
we're interested it in the age variable.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,310
We will use a where statement to restrict
our analysis.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,210
This will give us the distribution of age
among subjects with a value of zero for

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,060
the variable CHF.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,460
According to our data dictionary, a value
of zero for

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,980
CHF indicates that the subject did not
have heart failure complications.

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,030
Here, let's run the code.

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,470
As you can see,

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,790
you now get the distribution of age among
subjects who did not have heart failure.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,375
Let's use another piece of code to
demonstrate that you can do all sorts of

14
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,949
logical conditions in a where statement.

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,920
This code gives us the distribution of age
among subjects with no heart failure

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,360
complications, and were either males or in
the hospital for less than ten days.

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,790
>> If you just want to write a statistical
analysis for

18
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,330
multiple levels of a categorical variable,
you can use a class statement.

19
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:05,930
Here's an example.

20
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,410
Class is female.

21
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,680
Tell Sass that the column called is female
is a categorical variable.

22
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,450
Sass will run a separate univariate
analysis for

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,570
each unique level of the is female
variable.

24
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,020
This variable has two unique levels.

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,850
It can have a zero for male subjects or a
one for female subjects.

26
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:25,420
Let's run the code.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,440
We can see that Sass automatically
provides one analysis that is

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,990
restricted to subjects with Is female
equals zero, and

29
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,820
then a second analysis that is restricted
as subjects with is female equals one.

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,140
Now, we can easily compare the
distribution of age for men and women.
