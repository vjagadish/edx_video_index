1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,590
Let's dive into some actual real-case
scenario.

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,410
A very busy procedure day.

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,770
Cases were late in getting started for a
number of reasons.

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,226
Proceduralist was anxious to get this next
case started on time.

5
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:27,225
Because they had a whole clinic schedule
to deal with.

6
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:29,209
The patient was minimally sedated and

7
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:33,470
was a little groggy in responding to
questions from the nurse.

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,423
The nurse normally uses the consent from
the clinic, but in this case there were

9
00:00:37,423 --> 00:00:40,960
issues with trying to locate the forms in
electronic medical record.

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,900
The proceduralist was pretty sure of the
procedure location.

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,750
You could picture this scenario where the
doctor walks up to the patient and

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,400
says, hey, we're going to work on your
knee, right?

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,330
And, the patient responds by saying,
right.

14
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,600
And, in the doctor's mind in that moment
they heard right.

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,310
Patient confirmed right.

16
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,522
And so the thought was, hey we're going to
go ahead and

17
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:13,570
work on the right knee when in reality it
was, it was actually the other extremity.

18
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,170
The outcome?

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,370
The patient was brought into the procedure
room.

20
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,650
The right side of the patient was prepped
and draped.

21
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,506
The proceduralist started to do the
procedure and

22
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:25,690
realized that the pathology was on the
opposite side.

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,240
The correct side was then anesthetized,
prepped, and

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,790
draped, where the rest of the procedure
proceeded uneventfully.

25
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,480
Now, in this scenario.

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,270
Which probably happens based on our
earlier statistics,

27
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,160
as many as 40 times a week across the
country.

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,850
Had multiple issues or multiple factors
that led to this particular outcome.

29
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,470
What were some of the potential factors?

30
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,049
Starts off with a concept regarding
marking of procedure site.

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,070
It's an element within the Joint
Commission's universal protocol.

32
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,670
The need to do a time out.

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,690
Talking to the doctor, the doctor said the
patient said right,

34
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,190
I thought it was right.

35
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,090
You know, we had to move, so there you go.

36
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,910
Was fatigue and distraction at issue.

37
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:32,608
We all have heard of the studies where
folks that are sleep deprived

38
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:37,944
the response to reacting or you know,
doing different activities is

39
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:42,800
equivalent to having a couple cocktails in
the system.

40
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:48,975
distraction, is that a factor where the
focus is on trying to

41
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:51,250
get the case started?

42
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,330
Get the procedure done so we can hustle
off to the clinic.

43
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,830
That could be certainly a form of
production pressure, where there's

44
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,860
a need to turn over the room quickly, move
the patient in, get the procedure started.

45
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,649
You can get the procedure going so we can
move on to the next case.

46
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,100
Other factors.

47
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,310
Were there lighting, noise, distraction?

48
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,320
Those things environmentally could
contribute to having a adverse event.

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,140
Staff training.

50
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,130
Did they have the right people?

51
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,730
competent, qualified, trained to know
exactly what needs to be done.

52
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,240
Communication, was it crystal clear?

53
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,469
Were we all on the same page?

54
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,230
Were we effectively being a good team,
working in a single mindset.

55
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,650
You know, be able to know what our focus
is.

56
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,060
And, to help each other out in the event
that something not quite right

57
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,085
could've been called out and could be
dealt with.

58
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,640
And the problem corrected before actually
any harm should occur to a patient.

59
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,780
And then ultimately, it's the culture.

60
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,550
As physicians, you have a huge role in
terms of

61
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,240
establishing that culture of the team.

62
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,370
So, what were some of the lessons learned?

63
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,780
Procedures on wrong patient or wrong
location are truly preventable.

64
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,268
Studies have shown that at least one
person on a procedure team was aware of

65
00:04:14,268 --> 00:04:19,180
this, but due to the culture within the
procedure team, afraid to raise the issue.

66
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,978
I know many of us were trained in the
hierarchical structure of

67
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:29,514
a treatment team, you know, especially as
a medical student,

68
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:34,451
resident, first-year resident, intern,
fellow, attending.

69
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:39,551
That, you know, it's not uncommon that the
person that has the most detail could be

70
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,764
one of the more inexperienced team.

71
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:44,258
And just the sheer fact that they may be
aware of it,

72
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:47,738
they could have been in a position of
calling some, calling it out, and

73
00:04:47,738 --> 00:04:51,310
this would've avoided a lot of hassle, for
a lot of different people.

74
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,680
This could be due to a number of issues,
including previous bad experience,

75
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,889
unfamiliarity with team members, different
communication styles or methods.

76
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,190
And let's not forget, you know, English as
a second language or

77
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,000
English not being a primary language.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,550
And especially since we are operating in a
very culturally

79
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,849
ethnically diverse population in many,
many healthcare organization.

80
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,070
A lot of it could be communication gaps or

81
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,900
communication issues totally unintended,
so be aware of those factors.

82
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,219
What you say and do can significantly
influence how your team responds.

83
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,386
Some prevention suggestions to prevent
this kind of event from recurring,

84
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:43,630
a quick huddle to brief what is about to
be done.

85
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:48,050
We're not talking about the ten minute, 15
minute type of thing.

86
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,950
We're talking about, like, take like, the
10 seconds to

87
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,900
confirm according to whatever your policy
procedure is for your area, or core

88
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,240
documents to make sure that you actually
don't do something on the wrong location.

89
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,380
Take responsibility for the marking of the
procedure site.

90
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,303
In many organizations across the country,

91
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:13,928
they leave it to the senior most physician
senior most surgeon.

92
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:18,206
That is that if you have a chief resident
that's in the room, or a fellow or

93
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:21,518
the attending take the responsibility of
confirming and

94
00:06:21,518 --> 00:06:25,600
marking the procedure site according to
your policy and procedure.

95
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,890
Participate in the procedural pause or
time out.

96
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,410
As I mentioned earlier this is not a five
minute deal.

97
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:39,010
This is actually a quick five second, hey
we're working on Miss,

98
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,950
you know, Maggie Smith.

99
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:47,600
We're going to be working on the right
bunion of her right foot.

100
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,770
Are we all in agreement?

101
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,786
And that pause could be the,

102
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:58,600
once final checkpoint before you actually
make that incision to start the procedure.

103
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,709
That checkpoint could be enough to
actually prevent a misadventure.

104
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,090
Be aware of production pressure, fatigue
and communication style.

105
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,490
And these are some of the steps that you
could actually implement as part of

106
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,590
your practice to prevent a bad thing from
happening.
