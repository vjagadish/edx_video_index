1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,700
The second type of probability we can
calculate with counting method is

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,570
something where we don't have replacement.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,350
And these are going to be things like when
you're dealing with decks of card.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,530
Once you take a card out of a deck, it's
no longer available.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,270
So, it's without replacement.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,510
So, here's a simple example,

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,130
what's the probability of drawing two aces
from a standard deck of cards?

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,770
What would be the probability of drawing
two aces?

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,045
So, let's use the counting method to solve
this.

10
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:28,800
Again, there's more than one way to solve
to this, but

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,970
we're going to use the counting method
here.

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,190
So, what's the probability of drawing 2
aces?

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,580
So again, we're going to make our
demonator all the possible outcome, and

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,049
we're going to make our numerator all the
ways in which you can draw 2 aces.

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,870
So, I'm going to start with the numerator.

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,750
And literally, I'm just going to write out
how many different ways can you draw 2

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,259
aces when you draw 2 cards from a deck.

18
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:50,880
And I literally just draw them out.

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,642
So, you could get ace of clubs and ace of
diamonds.

20
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:56,708
You could get ace of clubs and ace of
hearts.

21
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:59,352
You could get ace of spades and ace of
hearts.

22
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:03,805
And notice that I am counting it
differently, if it's ace of clubs, and

23
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:10,462
then ace of diamonds versus is it's ace of
diamonds, and then ace of clubs.

24
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:13,355
So, we're considering order in the
numerator right now.

25
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:14,510
We're considering the order.

26
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,430
The order matters.

27
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,280
I'm counting it differently if there, if
they have a different order.

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,450
I don't have to do that to solve this
problem, as we'll see in a minute.

29
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,470
But if I count order in the denominator,

30
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,730
I've gotta count an order in the
numerator, and vice versa.

31
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,340
So, for this first iteration of solving
this problem, I'm going to consider order.

32
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,480
So, that's the numerator.

33
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,660
There's 12 ways you can draw ace aces, and
literally, I've just written them out.

34
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,920
How about the denominator?

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,562
The denominator, turns out that there are
52 times 51

36
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:45,810
different two-card sequences that you can
draw from a deck of cards.

37
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,850
And again, I'm considering order here.

38
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,980
And why is that?

39
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,730
Where did I get that?

40
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,850
Well, you can again, draw out some kind of
tree, just like we did for the dice.

41
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,789
So, the first thing that can happen is I
can get any one of 52 cards.

42
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:07,235
Let's say that in the first card, I draw,
say an ace of hearts.

43
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:08,240
Okay.

44
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,390
If I draw an ace of hearts,

45
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,840
then I can enumerate all the possibilities
that are left.

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,050
Well, once I've drawn that ace of hearts,
there are only 51 cards left.

47
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,340
I can no longer, the ace of hearts is
gone.

48
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,490
So now, there is only 51 choices.

49
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,310
So, if I draw out all the possible two
card sequences,

50
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,810
once I'm on the ace of hearts branch,
then,

51
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,970
the all, there's only 51 possible things
that can happen after that.

52
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,110
So, we start with 52 branches, but

53
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,330
whichever branch you go down, the next
node is only going to have 51 branches.

54
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,890
So, you start with 52 choices.

55
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,780
But then, because one of them has been
lost, it's been pulled out of the deck,

56
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,850
there's only 51 left next.

57
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,570
So, the prob, the total number of
different two card sequences you draw,

58
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,520
you can possibly draw is going to be 52
times 51.

59
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,520
And notice again that if you look at all
the branches that will come out here,

60
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,950
the ace of hearts followed by the ace of
diamonds will be different,

61
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,010
a different branch, than the ace of
diamonds followed by the ace of hearts.

62
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,510
So again, we're considering order here.

63
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,490
So, the denominator here will be 52 times
51.

64
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,790
Then, we can just divide the numerator by
the denominator to get the probability.

65
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,728
So, the probability that you draw two
aces,

66
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:23,630
when you draw two cards out of a deck is
12 divided by 52 times 51.

67
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,605
So, that's one way to solve this problem.

68
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,480
Again, it's not the only way.

69
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,230
We can also try to solve the problem
ignoring order.

70
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,740
A lot of people feel like oh, I don't, why
should the order matter.

71
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,590
It doesn't matter for the hands that you
have in a card deck.

72
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,300
So, there are card games, so lets ignore
order.

73
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,240
So, we can solve the same thing ignoring
order.

74
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,950
But if we ignore order in the numerator,

75
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,542
we've got to ignore order in the
denominator.

76
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:47,010
So, if I ignore order, there's actually I
can write out that's

77
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,320
there's 6 possible different pairs of aces
where I'm not considering order.

78
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,772
So, my numerator will now be 6.

79
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:55,520
For the denominator,

80
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,110
the only way to get rid of the order is
simply to divide out the order.

81
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,170
So, I'm literally going to just divide by
2 here.

82
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,610
Because there was 52 times 51 different 2
card sequences.

83
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,840
If you want to divide out all the repeats,
you just divide by 2 here.

84
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,960
So then, the denominator becomes 1326.

85
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,230
So, we can divide the 2 of those,

86
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,250
the numerator by the denominator to get
the probability.

87
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,930
Of course, it's the same probability that
we got when we considered order.

88
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,960
We're, we're hopping to get the same
probability no matter how we

89
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,845
approach the problem.

90
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,305
I'm just going to throw.

91
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:24,850
Okay.

92
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,890
There's one more way to solve this.

93
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,670
As you can see,

94
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,320
probability is tricky because there may be
multiple ways to get the same answer.

95
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,080
So, here's another way that you can get
the right answer, and this way's

96
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,030
probably the way that most people find the
easiest, but is something that we're

97
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,770
going to be talking about more in Module 2
than in this particular module.

98
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,640
So, this is not a counting method, but
rather,

99
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,890
you could just say look at it this way.

100
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,833
What's the probability of drawing an ace
on the first draw?

101
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,457
Well, that's 4 out of 52.

102
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:56,880
.We calculated that before.

103
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,470
So, you can calculate that probability.

104
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,500
And then, you can ask, well, now that I've
drawn an ace on the first draw,

105
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,560
what's the probability of drawing an ace
again, a second event?

106
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,590
Well, once you've drawn one ace outta the
deck,

107
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,230
now you're down to 51 total cards in the
deck and only 3 aces.

108
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,630
So, the probability that you draw an ace
on the second draw as well,

109
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,520
is now 3 out of 51.

110
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,800
It's different because something already
happened.

111
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,346
You could say the the probability of
drawing an ace on the first draw is

112
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:23,900
4 out of 52.

113
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,863
The probability of also drawing an ace on
the second draw is 3 out of 51.

114
00:05:27,863 --> 00:05:33,030
And we could just multiply those together
because in probably and means multiply.

115
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,170
So, the probability of both of those
things happening to calculate that,

116
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,670
you're going to multiply those together.

117
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,540
So, notice that when you multiply those
together you get

118
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,400
the same exact probability as we got
before, 12 divided by 52 times 51.

119
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,980
So, it doesn't matter which way you
approach this,

120
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,680
there's multiple ways to get the same
answer.

121
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,340
And again, we're going to talk more about
using this multiplication rule,

122
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,650
multiplying probabilities together in
Module 2.

123
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,990
This is technically not a, a counting
method that we've done here.
