1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,720
The final concept I want to go over with
regards to the standard normal curve is

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,540
that, sometimes, you aren't given the Z, a
lot of these problems are setup so

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,120
that you, you're given the Z and then you
have to find the probability.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,600
But sometimes the problems go in the other
direction,

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,260
that is you're given the probability and
you have to work back to the z-score.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,050
So if you're doing it in the inverse like
this, that's called a probit function.

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,610
So a probit function just means you're
given the area and

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,660
you have to find the z-score.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,920
So let me just give you an example and
make it very clear.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,060
So what if you wanted to know, for

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,400
this math SAT score, you wanted to know
what SAT score do I have to

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,640
get in order to be in the ninetieth
percentile of math SAT scores?

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,600
And again, assuming that we're on we have
a mean of 500 and

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,970
a standard deviation of 50.

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,810
So, how are we going to solve this
problem?

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,891
So we need to know what's the z-score that
goes with the ninetieth percentile.

17
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:56,990
Ninetieth percentile is just an area.

18
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,390
We want to know what's the Z-value that
corresponds to an area of ninetieth,

19
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,146
of 90%.

20
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:07,130
So, the ninetieth percentile for math SAT
scores is going to be somewhere over here.

21
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,900
That means that 90% of people are lower.

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,400
So that means our area to the left is 90%.

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,000
So we're going to go to the z chart.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,620
We're going to find the area of 90% and
work backward to the z-score.

25
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,430
So if I go to my z chart and

26
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,400
I just have this, I literally have to scan
around with my eyes until I find 0.90.

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,650
And you'll notice that it comes 0.88,
8997, you also get 0.9015.

28
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:35,590
0.8997 is the closest to 0.90, so I'm just
going to pick that one.

29
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:41,600
So, that corresponds to what z-score, if
you scroll over, it's a 1.28.

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,020
So that corresponds to a z-score of a
1.28.

31
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,370
So, in order to have 90% area and to the
left, you need a z-score of 1.28.

32
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,980
So to be in the ninetieth percentile for

33
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:57,220
SAT scores, you need to be 1.28 standard
deviation above the average.

34
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,200
So what is 1.28 standard deviations above
the average if I want to

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,130
actually get the number, the number for
the SAT score that I'm going to need?

36
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,320
Well, how would I solve that?

37
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,030
Well, what is in this case, a standard
deviation is is a value of 50.

38
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,320
So first of all, I would multiply the
z-score times the standard deviation.

39
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,030
So, I want to be 1.28 standard deviations
above the mean,

40
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,910
that means I want to be 1.28 times 50
above the mean.

41
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,060
The mean here of course is 500, so I'm
just adding to the mean.

42
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,600
When I calculate the amount, I get that I
need to have a,

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,020
an SAT score of at least 564 if I want to
be in the ninetieth percentile.
