00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,170
Yeah, I know Dr. Harrison and I already
started that case.

00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,420
Oh, okay.
Well, he, he's an 80 year old gentleman.

8
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,350
He fell at home.

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,798
He has a, subdural hematoma, so we're
going to evacuate.

I just saw the surgeon come in the room.

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:48,746
Can I call you right back?

14
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:49,767
Okay.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,380
So this guy's an 80 year old gentleman,
subdural hematoma,

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,190
pretty straight-forward, craniotomy in
order to evacuate that.

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,860
Yeah, I'm going to go get the Mayfield
clamp and

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,480
we're going to prepare the turn the table.

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,370
>> Okay.
>> If you could make sure he gets,

22
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,050
Ceftriaxone.

23
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,360
>> Yeah.
>> Make sure he's comfortable for

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,850
that Mayfield clamp by the time I get
back.

25
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,670
>> Okay, I'll give him some Remifentanil
for that.

00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,600
>> Okay.
Thanks.

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,060

Here we go.
There's the Remifentanil.

There we go, here's the remy.

30
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,740
Let me give him one micro cc.

31
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,350
So that'd be.

32
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,810
One micro kilo, that's two cc.

That's 100 kilos.

All right.

00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,760
That should get him nice and comfortable.

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,960
Okay.
Get some of that, Ceftriaxone going here.

37
