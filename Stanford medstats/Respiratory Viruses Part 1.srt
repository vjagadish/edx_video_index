1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,265
This presentation is about respiratory
viruses and

2
00:00:05,265 --> 00:00:09,950
specificall, I'm going to talk about four
families of respiratory viruses,

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,680
the rhinoviruses, the coronaviruses, the
adenoviruses,.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,810
And the parainfluenza viruses.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,340
I'll make a few comments about the
epidemiology of these viral infections,

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,330
their classic clinical manifestations and
ideas about management.

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,460
With regards to rhinovirus, we've al had
plenty of experience with rhinovirus,

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,945
the most prominent cause of the common
cold.

9
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:35,250
[COUGH] We know there's not much you can
do about them.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,030
And in the wisdom of Sir WIlliam Osler, he
said,

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,930
there's in fact only one way to treat a
cold, and that is with contempt.

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,750
These viruses are a member of the
picornavi, picornavirus family.

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,052
And they enter our body after they've
attached to so

14
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:53,870
called intracellular adhesion molecules,
ICAMS.

15
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,540
They then are internalized in those
particular host cells and replicate and

16
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,200
spread to other cells.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,740
There are more than 100 serotypes of
rhinovirus that

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,770
circulate in a random fashion over time.

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,060
We rapidly acquire these infections during
early childhood.

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,290
Childhood, in fact it is common in the
first few years of

21
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:20,030
life to have three to six rhinovirus
infections per year of life.

22
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,460
These viruses often, optimally replicate
in colder environments,

23
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,650
the nose is a colder part of our body than
most other parts,

24
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,806
hence they tend to hang out in the nose.

25
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:35,000
Their acid [UNKNOWN] will not pass through
the acid heavy stomach and

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,100
be excreted in the stools, they are rather
inactivated.

27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,380
These viruses are difficult to culture in
cell culture and

28
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,510
there's no rapid test available to make
the diagnosis.

29
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,220
But we don't really care because the
diagnosis is made clinically.

30
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,720
The clinical manifestations of Rhinovirus
usually start

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,980
after an incubation period of two to three
days.

32
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,920
So you come in contact with an infected
individual and two to three days later

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,720
you might have the onset of mild symptoms
that may persist for five to seven days.

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,880
The mild symptoms include a runny and
stuffy nose.

35
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,700
A sore throat perhaps with some hoarseness
perhaps a cough.

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,100
Very rarely there will be a fever, but it
is important to recognize that there

37
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,900
is often sub pulmonary clinical
involvement and

38
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,850
you might have noticed this in yourself.

39
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,390
If you are an aerobic exorsizer you may
have noticed that you

40
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,430
can not run as fast or as far as when you
don't have a cold.

41
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,350
And that is because cytokines are causing
some lower.

42
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,260
Respiratory track impairment.

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,700
These viral infections may be more severe
in certain populations for example,

44
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,640
in persons with chronic lung disease like
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

45
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,040
They may cause exacerbation transiently
worsening the pulmonary findings.

46
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,940
These Rhinovirus infections may be
complicated by a bacterial infection,

47
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,770
a super infection with manifestation of
ear infection.

48
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,650
otitis media or sinusitis.

49
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,600
Some hosts are susceptible to worse
rhinovirus infections than others.

50
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,060
Especially true of heavy smokers or the
elderly or

51
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,760
those who are immunocompromised in some
fashion.

52
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,670
Another cause of the common cold are
corona viruses.

53
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,270
And these have not garnered much
attention, or

54
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,980
did not garner much attention, until 2003,
when there was a worldwide

55
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,440
epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome, or SARS.

56
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,500
And that really got the attention allowed
attention to go towards a coronavirus,

57
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,640
because it was a type of coronavirus that
caused SARS.

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,460
More recently MERS, which stands for

59
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,650
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, has also
emerged.

60
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,980
And that also is a coronavirus.

61
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,840
They're called coronaviruses because under
electron microscopy they have

62
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,400
a crown appearance in their outer
membrane.

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,220
They have peplomers on their surface and
other than SARS and

64
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,070
MERS as I've already mentioned, these
mostly simply cause the common cold.

65
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,100
When SARS emerged, the CDC Director at the
time Julie Gerberding.

66
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,480
Made the following comment.

67
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,970
If the virus moves faster than our
scientific communications and

68
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,550
control capacities, we could be in for a
long difficult race.

69
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,390
The race is on, the stakes are high, and
the outcome cannot be predicted.

70
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,610
Fortunately there was rapid scientific
discoveries made with

71
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,470
regards to the coronavirus.

72
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,800
Including that it was a corona virus, how
spread could be prevented and

73
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,630
epidemics control, so the 2003 epidemic
did end quite quickly.

74
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:58,015
However well it was varying strong it was
noted that the virus was quite severe.

75
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:02,740
20% of infected individuals were admitted
to the Intensive Care Unit and

76
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,160
the mortality rate was 10%.

77
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,230
An important core morbidities were
identified and

78
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,620
advanced age was recognized as a risk
factor.

79
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,620
Ultimately and before the epidemic ended,

80
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:20,100
there were about 8,000 cases with about
774 deaths.

81
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,460
Around the world.

82
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,780
I mention MERS corona virus has recently
emerged.

83
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:33,440
This picture of the world from the time of
the SARS epidemic was published in 2011.

84
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,580
And it shows the countries that had
different numbering cases for

85
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,560
Coronavirus infections and you can see on

86
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,750
this map that the countries with the most
infections were Hong Kong and

87
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,029
Taiwan and Vietnam to the East and Canada
to the West.

88
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,270
Allot of investigation followed the
outbreak of coronavirus to try to

89
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,500
figure out where it had come from, and
without going into detail,

90
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,330
ultimately, the bat was implicated as an
important vector.

91
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,850
The bat.

92
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:14,210
Spread the infection to the so, the Civet
cat the Civet cat through

93
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:19,390
ingestion of the cat and other mechanisms
spread the infection to humans and

94
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,880
in human to human transmission followed
that.

95
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,360
Moving to a different virus, Adenovirus.

96
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,610
Adenoviruses cause a lot of different
illness beyond the respiratory tract, and,

97
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,330
but I'm going to focus on the respiratory
tract.

98
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,680
These viruses are double stranded, non
segmented DNA viruses.

99
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,270
There are many serotypes, more than 50
causing infections in humans.

100
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,510
They have some distinguishing physical
characteristics.

101
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,620
They can be isolated in tissue culture.

102
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,660
And there are rapid antigenic tests
available.

103
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,900
In certain populations have a particularly
high morbidity and

104
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,190
even mortality caused by adenoviruses.

105
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,510
These include Native Americans, military
recruits, new born infants, and

106
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,019
some who are immunocompromised for other
reason.

107
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,140
The Myriad illnesses are listed in this
particular slide, but

108
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,390
the ones that are would underscore that
are most typical in suggestive of

109
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:28,720
adenovirus are pharyngoconjunctival fever
and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.

110
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,900
So pharyngoconjunctival fever is what it
sounds like.

111
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,920
It's infection and

112
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,230
inflammation of the pharynx and the
conjunctiva associated with fever.

113
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,010
Quite common with certain adenoviruses.

114
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,350
An epidemic keratoconjunctivitis causes
epidemic that is

115
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,840
widespread red eye or pink eye.

116
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,390
And the picture that is shown on this
slide indicates an individual suffering

117
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,420
from adenovirus, conjunctivitis.

118
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,110
Adenovirus can cause a number of other
illnesses listed on this slide as well.

119
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,130
Finally, parainfluenzavirus is a member of
the paramyxovirus family,

120
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,050
it's a single stranded RNA virus, there
are four types.

121
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,440
And this virus has a non segmented genome,
when put in to tissue culture, it

122
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,770
causes very limited cytopathogenic effect
although it change the cells in tissue

123
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,850
culture to, want to absorb red cells if
they're poured on to the tissue culture.

124
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,800
Something called hemadsorption,

125
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,190
which maybe used in viral diagnostic
laboratories.

126
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,590
Different parainfluenzaviruses has
different seasonality patterns.

127
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,980
Serotype 1 is mostly in the fall months,
and

128
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:44,140
this is the virus that causes
laryngotracheobronchitis or croup.

129
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,950
Croup is ,.

130
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,870
You will, hear patients with croup from
down the hallway, They go, Huh, huh.

131
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,680
And they have that barking like cough.

132
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,770
These parainfluenzaviruses, in addition to
causing croup,

133
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,510
can also cause other infections of the
respiratory tract, including.

134
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,340
Bronchitis and pneumonia, laryngitis and

135
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:11,010
pharyngitis, or they might just call cause
an undifferentiated febrile illness,

136
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,320
which interestingly can go on for a long
period of time.

137
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,660
Immunity to these viruses is imperfect.

138
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,270
So reinfections occur.

139
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,700
Croup is distinctive, I've tried to
exemplify that distinction with my barking

140
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,110
cough, other manifestations are shown on
this slide, and the only treatment for

141
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,180
croup is to actually support the patient,
try to relieve their apprehension,

142
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,480
give them oxygen if necessary, and mist
therapy may be helpful.

143
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,320
This schematic shows the classic
radiographic finding associated with

144
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,290
croup, the so called steeple side.

145
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,310
Or the narrowing of the airway, and

146
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,290
you can see it schematically represented
below.

147
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,630
And this picture is trying to demonstrate
the subglottic narrowing that

148
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,900
occurs with croup and causes the barking
like cough.

149
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,860
This final summary table outlines the
principal features of this virus for

150
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,820
your reference.
