1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,250
This presentation is an introduction to
virology.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,980
At the end of this presentation,

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:12,260
you should be able to explain the ways, by
which viruses are transmitted.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,700
You should be able to define the common
terms that are used to

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,900
describe viral infections, including
tropism and virulence.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,890
You should be able to list the major host
immune factors that

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:29,420
are important to both the occurrence of
viral infections, and to their severity.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,790
And finally, in general,

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,630
to describe strategies that can reduce the
spread of viral infections.

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,940
With regards to transmissions, viruses are
readily transmitted between hosts.

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,050
They are referred to, historically, as
communicable diseases.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,650
This transmission can be direct, that is
host to host, or

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,030
it can go through an inanimate object,
also referred to as a fomite.

14
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,540
With regards to mechanisms of spread,
viruses can spread by direct

15
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:05,390
contact between bodily fluids, exemplified
by oral herpes or genital herpes.

16
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,230
Viruses can spread across the placenta,

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:12,260
from a pregnant mother to her unborn fetus
and cause congenital infection,

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:18,790
such as congenital rubella, Viruses can be
directly inoculated, into the body.

19
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:24,810
For example, through injection by illicit
drug use and resulting in hepatitis.

20
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,610
They also can be directly inoculated
through trauma, the trauma of a bite, for

21
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,170
example, from a rabid bat or rabid dog.

22
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,750
They can be transmitted with the help of a
arthropod vector, for

23
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,090
example, a mosquito causing and spreading
West Nile virus.

24
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,770
Or, they can be spread with the help of a
different kind of vector,

25
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,330
a rodent vector, as is exemplified by
Lassa fever.

26
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,950
Some key terms to know with regards to
viruses are highlighted in red.

27
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:01,850
A primary infection is one occurring for
the first time in a susceptible host.

28
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,530
If the infection is associated with
symptoms,

29
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,040
the symptoms tend to be more severe than
an inf,

30
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,350
a secondary infection or reinfection,
which I'll talk about in a moment.

31
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,680
A latent infection refers to an infection
in which the virus has

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,502
entered the body and has become latent if,
it, it becomes dormant.

33
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:26,995
It is integrated in the body, but it's not
causing any problem.

34
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:32,930
Nonetheless, it can be reactivated from
latency, and that is called reactivation.

35
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,860
Herpes viruses exemplify this.

36
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:40,900
Viruses may also, you can get a
reinfection, rather than a reactivation.

37
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,100
A reinfection means exposure to a new and
unique virus, maybe of the same family,

38
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,660
but it's a reinfection, it's not the
reactivation of an old infection.

39
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,470
A subclinical infection is what it sounds
like,

40
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,880
an infection occurring in the absence of
symptoms.

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,470
An acute infection is one that occurs in a
short period of time, for example,

42
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,680
a common cold.

43
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,450
Whereas, a chronic infection is one that
has a long

44
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,370
relationship with the host, such as
certain forms of hepatitis.

45
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,880
Viruses, you can get two viral infections
at the same time,

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,721
that's called a coinfection.

47
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:24,660
Or, a viral infection can set the host up
for a bacterial infection,

48
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,520
in which case the bacteria would be
causing a superinfection,

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,540
an infection on top of a previous
infection.

50
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,220
Viral tropism and virulence are also
important terms.

51
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,670
Tropism refers to the avidity of the virus
for

52
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,252
particular type of host cell or tissue.

53
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:46,930
Much of tropism is defined by host cell
receptors,

54
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,220
different types of receptors and there are
other factors that drive tropism.

55
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,680
Some viruses favor particular organs.

56
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,450
Obviously respiratory viruses like to go
to the respiratory tract, and

57
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,160
hepatitis viruses like to go to the liver.

58
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,370
Virulence is different from tropism.

59
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:10,210
Virulence reflects the inherent ability of
specific viruses to cause disease.

60
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:14,350
A low virulent virus would cause very
little disease,

61
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,660
a highly virulent virus would cause a lot
of disease.

62
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,410
Viruses that are localized in one organ
often are of low virulence, but

63
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,080
if they spread throughout the body,

64
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,864
they disseminate, those might be of higher
virulence.

65
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:30,588
So localized versus dissemination helps to

66
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:33,760
think about virulence as a viral
characteristic.

67
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,810
The host immunity against viruses is
widespread and

68
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,230
includes both the innate immune system and
the adaptive immune system.

69
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,640
The immune system not only determines
whether we get infected or

70
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,410
not, but also the clinical expression of
the infection including the outcome.

71
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,220
The skin and mucosal surfaces are the
first defense against

72
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,950
many infectious pathogens, including
viruses.

73
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,350
The ciliary function of the respiratory
tract is the protective mechanism to

74
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,820
prevent viruses from going from the upper
to the lower respiratory tract.

75
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,960
Antibodies are an important source of
immune protection against viruses,

76
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,557
both secretory antibody, such as occur in
the nasal mucosa, and the gastrointestinal

77
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:27,930
tract, and systemic antibody responses of
IgM and IgG classes, for example.

78
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,130
Natural killer cells are an important part
of the innate immune system,

79
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,930
trying to protect us against viral
infections, and T-cells and

80
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,670
cytokine function and responses are
important components of the immune system,

81
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,010
as for many viral infections.

82
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,260
The key to preventing viral infections,
there really are three.

83
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,120
One is vaccination, another is
hand-washing, and

84
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,270
the third is transmission-based
precautions,

85
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,830
meaning wearing some combination of masks,
gloves, and gowns.

86
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,830
Vaccination is available for all of the
viruses listed, and

87
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,005
these are routine parts of vaccinating
populations in North America.

88
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:15,840
Whenever one encounters a patient or even
a family member who is infected,

89
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,910
it's very important to wash your hands
often and

90
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,815
completely, because this helps to prevent
infections.

91
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:26,974
And the transmission-based precautions
vary a bit.

92
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:32,490
If the virus is airborne by small
particle, the examples given,

93
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,720
or by droplet particle or by direct
contact, some combination of mask,

94
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,920
gloves, and gowns will be recommended to
prevent the transmission of virus or

95
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,360
the spread of virus between individuals.
