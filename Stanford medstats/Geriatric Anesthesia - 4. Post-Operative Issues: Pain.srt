4
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:27,750
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Larry Chu.

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,180
>> And I'm Dr. Kevin Jenner.

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,120
>> Welcome back to this course on the
Essentials of Geriatric Anesthesia.

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,285
In this segment, we're going to talk about
pain.

8
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:41,470
Post-operative pain control in the elderly
patient.

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,360
We have three learning objectives for you
in this segment.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,130
We're going to talk about how to assess
pain, the fifth vital sign,

11
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:55,330
especially in elderly patients and the
challenges that may arise there.

12
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,510
We're going to talk about the role of
regional anesthesia in pain management,

13
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,810
and we're going to wrap up by talking
about the WHO ladder and how,

14
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,520
how to use that as a model for pain
management in elderly patients.

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,660
So let's get started.

16
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,660
>> Let's get started.

17
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,840
>> So Kevin, talk to me a little bit about
challenges or

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,930
unique issues associated with assessing
pain,

19
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,230
which of course we know as the fifth vital
sign, in our elderly patients.

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,700
>> Well, it's important to remember that
elderly patients and

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,730
geriatric patients in general, may have a
decreased perception of pain.

22
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,290
As a result the same type of insult or

23
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,330
the same type of surgical procedure to a
geriatric patient may not result in

24
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,840
the same level of pain as it would in a
younger patient.

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,190
That being said, geriatric patients are
also more less likely to ask for

26
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,430
pain medication.

27
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,270
When it comes to treating their pain,
they're less likely to, to ask a nurse or

28
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,770
a doctor and

29
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,070
say, I have pain and ask for that
medication in order to treat that pain.

30
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,880
When geriatric patients are in the
immediate post-operative period,

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,700
that's why it's very important to reassess
their pain frequently and asked them

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,990
ever time that they're seen, do they have
pain and how much pain do they have.

33
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,570
Is it something that they find tolerable
or is it something that they deem,

34
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,750
that they would like to have treated.

35
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,960
It's important to use verbal over visual
scales, as well.

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,610
When it comes to working with patients,

37
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,110
we use the ten point scale with some
patients, sometimes a visual scale where

38
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,860
we have them point to a card indicating
how much pain they're in.

39
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,660
Studies have shown that the verbal scale
tends to work better than

40
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,960
visual techniques, in terms of identifying
someone's level of pain.

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,060
Now, when it comes to the Intensive Care
unit,

42
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,800
that can be a difficult situation, because
patients may be incubated and

43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,750
assessing pain in them can be more
difficult.

44
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,990
How would you do that Dr. Chu?

45
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,046
>> Well, you know, it's a challenge.

46
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:50,620
obviously, an incubated patient can't talk
to you.

47
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,120
So, you're not going to be able to use
those verbal scales of assessment.

48
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,950
What you can do, is you can look at vital
signs, for

49
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,640
instance is the patient hypertensive or
tachycardic?

50
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,350
Does do, do those vital signs decrease
when you provide some pain medication.

51
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,200
That can give you some sense of if it's
pain that's causing the,

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,530
the, the, the aberration of vital signs.

53
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,990
Of course, you want to look for

54
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:24,100
also the appearance of discomfort,
grimacing and or agitation.

55
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,760
They can also lead you to suspect pain.

56
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,980
Of course, you have to understand that
post-operative delirium,

57
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,290
can also cause those signs and

58
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:39,020
you have to be able to in a sense tease
out, whether or not that's the cause.

59
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,540
And of course, you also can have some
confounding by comorbid conditions.

60
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,820
If the patient was on pre existing opioids
before surgery, for instance.

61
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,060
He or she may have some pre-existing
opioid analgesic tolerance, for instance.

62
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,210
And you need to consider that part of the
medical history when you're trying to

63
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,910
assess post-operative pain in these
patients.

64
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,680
And of course finally, in general we need
to

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,274
remember that elderly patients not only
perceive pain differently.

66
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:14,000
They maybe less likely to ask, for pain
medication.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,070
So that's also something we need to
consider in the assessment of pain in

68
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,390
our elderly patients.

69
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,590
>> So we definitely have to make a
decision to offer pain treatment to

70
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,728
these patients, because they may not ask
for it.

71
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:28,459
Is that right?
>> And that's a very important pieces of

72
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:30,580
information that we need to keep in mind.

73
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:39,028
So, Kevin, let's talk a little bit about
regional anaesthesia.

74
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:44,258
Of course, we know regional anesthesia has
many benefits and we,

75
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:47,610
we talk about how it has less
side-effects.

76
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,420
How it can be better in managing
post-operative pain.

77
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,000
Does it also help with post-operative
delirium and cognitive dysfunction.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,175
It is something that we should be doing
routinely for

79
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:02,190
all of our geriatric patients.

80
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,430
>> Well, it, that's a very good question.

81
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,780
Regional techniques for for anes, using a
regional technique for

82
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,855
a surgical procedure has actually not been
associated with a decrease in

83
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,170
post-operative cognitive dysfunction.

84
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,650
So it's important to note,

85
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,170
that the incidence of these things don't
seem to be affected by your choice to do

86
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,680
a general anesthetic versus using regional
techniques.

87
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,600
Some studies are con, contradictory on
this particular subject, but by and

88
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,840
large it sound like there's, there is no
significant or solid evidence that shows

89
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,160
regional techniques prevent post-operative
cognitive dysfunction or decline.

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,880
They can however,

91
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,880
be useful to reduce the amount of pain
medication that the patient needs.

92
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,300
Is that right, Dr. Chu?

93
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,600
>> Well, I mean, I, I think that's the
point.

94
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,510
If you, you know,

95
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,660
you want to provide superior analgesia or
minimizing other side effects.

96
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,390
And of course, opioids have a plethora of
side effects.

97
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:57,687
Not only analgesic opioid, analgesic
tolerance, you, you have you know,

98
00:05:57,687 --> 00:06:04,680
decreased bowel mobility you, you have
pruritus you have sedation.

99
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,360
So, there's a lot of issues associated
with opioids that we

100
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,840
can avoid if we don't use regional
anesthetics.

101
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:17,848
So, if it doesn't necessarily prevent or
decreased incidence of post-operative

102
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:22,180
pruritus cognitive dysfunction, at least
we can use regional anesthesia to

103
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,260
decrease the other side effects associate
with opioid medications, in general.

104
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,920
So, Kevin, let's wrap things up.

105
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,410
Let's talk a little bit about this WHO
ladder and

106
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:40,820
how we might use it as a strategy for
treating pain in our elderly patients.

107
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,350
So, talk to me a little bit about this
division ladder.

108
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,600
Is it an actual ladder that you climb up?

109
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,630
What is this thing?

110
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,750
>> No, it's, it's it's not a natural
ladder.

111
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,350
It's a a mental technique or a mental
cognitive aid to help

112
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,430
you in determining what the appropriate
treatment is for a patient's pain.

113
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,240
The World Health Organization has made it
clear that pain is something that every

114
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,810
patient should have assessed in a medical
setting and pain should be treated,

115
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,920
if at all possible for patients.

116
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,620
It's, it's not something that we should,
we should do as an after thought.

117
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,080
It should be a primary concern of every
provider and,

118
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,660
especially anesthesiologists.

119
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,751
Now, to begin the later, the World Health
Organization re,

120
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:24,700
recommends using techniques, such as pet
therapy or music therapy,

121
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,480
which may assist the patient in coping
with their pain in the first place.

122
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,800
If the patient is comfortable, but still
has some pain, that's okay.

123
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,547
It's, it's up to the patient to decide
what level of pain they are willing to

124
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:39,780
tolerate and what level of pain is
comfortable for them.

125
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,730
It's not always possible to completely
eliminate pain.

126
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,900
So, it's important to know that these
things may actually help without getting

127
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,620
rid of pain in a pharmacological method.

128
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,180
In addition, if you're going to start
medications,

129
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,995
it's important to start with non-opioids
first.

130
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:57,900
Starting with things like NSAID,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or

131
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,510
Acetaminophen can be particularly helpful
for

132
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,670
elderly patients, if they are candidates
for those medications.

133
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,600
It's important to consider their
comorbidities before you decide to

134
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,550
prescribe those medications.

135
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,260
There is a place for opioid medications,
though.

136
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,590
And that's once you've, once you've passed
that rung on the ladder

137
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,960
of adjuvant therapies, such as physical
therapy, or

138
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,680
pet therapy, or these NSAID and
Acetaminophens, then you get to opioid.

139
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,964
>> Well, let's talk a little bit about
that.

140
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:23,820
[CROSSTALK]
>> So, you know,

141
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,680
the thing is pain has to be treated.

142
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:32,600
yes, opioids bring with them their own
problems

143
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,730
associated with the side effects such as
decreased bowel mobility or pruritus.

144
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,880
And of course, may contribute to the
symptoms or signs of delirium or

145
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,220
cognitive dysfunction.

146
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,810
However, pain untreated can do the same
thing.

147
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,400
>> Exactly.

148
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,930
>> So, we do need to treat pain.

149
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,900
I think the idea with the ladder is, start
at the low rungs first.

150
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,960
And once we've found that the pain is
refractory to those lower

151
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,800
rung [UNKNOWN] treatments, then we have to
move on to opioids.

152
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,550
But if we're going to use opioids, let's
be smart about it.

153
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:13,950
Let's start low and go slow and what I
mean by that is, start with low doses, and

154
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:19,460
escalate those doses slowly until we can
get the pain under control.

155
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,770
In our elderly patients, especially we
want to be checking on them multiple times

156
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,150
a day, so that we don't just write an
order and see them the next day.

157
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:32,020
We want to know how are they doing after
the morning dose, did that help them?

158
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,900
If we had side effects, what were they?

159
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,800
How can we continually adjust this dose,

160
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,380
until we find the right balance of
analgesia versus side effects.

161
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,520
So re-assessing multiple times per day is
important.

162
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,920
And of course, so that we best understand
what we're doing,

163
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,330
really avoid doing a lot of things at
