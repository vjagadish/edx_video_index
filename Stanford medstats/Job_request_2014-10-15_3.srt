00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,110
Hi, my name is Sharon Chen and

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,130
this video is the second part of the
Introduction to Respiratory Viruses.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,060
Giving you an overview of all respiratory
viruses with a focus on the virus.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,340
The learning objectives are to recognize
the epidemiology and

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,890
main route of transmission of the
respiratory viruses.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,080
To recognize appropriate use of diagnostic
tests for viral respiratory syndromes and

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,766
to explain the techniques used for
diagnosing specific viral infections.

9
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:31,688
Here's the pathogen list for our course
and in this video and the entire module,

10
00:00:31,688 --> 00:00:35,220
I will be discussing these viruses that
cause respiratory infections.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,790
Now, let's talk about the virus and

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,330
how the clinical syndromes relate to the
life cycle of the virus.

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,690
What viruses want to do is spread to other
hosts.

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,210
Essentially, exit.

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,960
The strategy that respiratory viruses have
evolved is to replicate quickly,

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,830
reaching high numbers of viruses causing
acute infection.

17
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,300
They cause symptoms in people to then exit
from that person.

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,310
For example, you can see this man sneezing
and he's spreading high titers of

19
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,270
viral particles to another person through
droplets and

20
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,540
aerosolization of the secretions.

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,330
All respiratory viruses transmit in this
same way.

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,070
And another similarity between the
respiratory viruses is in

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,270
RNA genome with one exception, which is
Adenovirus.

24
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,240
This allows them to mutate and avoid
immune surveillance.

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,300
Because of the ability to mutate many of
these viruses have multiple serotypes with

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,070
RSV being an exception.

27
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,880
Despite these similarities, they cause
different clinical syndromes.

28
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,820
The virus evolved to find its preferred
means of causing infection and disease.

29
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,055
This image looks at the clinical syndromes
relative to the virus.

30
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:38,670
It's essentially the same information that
I discussed already, but

31
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,460
I want to repeat an important point.

32
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,950
Each of these respiratory viruses can
cause multiple clinical syndromes.

33
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,630
For example, RSV and human metapneumovirus
mostly cause Bronchiolitis,

34
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,540
you can see the hump on the graph.

35
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,890
But sometimes it can cause a common cold.

36
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,370
Another difference between respiratory
viruses is that they cause illness in

37
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,220
different seasons.

38
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,400
Adenovirus is constant and doesn't have
seasonality.

39
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,840
Parainfluenza peaks in the late fall, but
RSV mostly occurs in the winter.

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,410
The seasonality suggests that there are
virus specific and

41
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,300
immunologic specific reasons for these
differences.

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,010
You can see from this image that several
of them peak in the winter.

43
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,564
All us us realize that we get more
respiratory infections in the winter and

44
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:21,717
this may be due to a more crowded
environment allowing the virus to

45
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:23,686
transmit easily from person to person.

46
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,622
I told you before that most, for

47
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:30,522
the most part you will not know which
virus is causing your patient's symptoms.

48
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:33,508
Usually, respiratory virus infections are
diagnosed clinically.

49
00:02:33,508 --> 00:02:36,075
Which is why we wanted to teach you the
clinical syndromes.

50
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:40,150
However, there are certain times when
identifying a virus is important.

51
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,930
And you'll have to decide when to do these
tests on your patient.

52
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,470
Here are some reasons for ordering tests
on an individual patient.

53
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,690
For example, you may choose to give
antiviral therapy for

54
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,710
a patient with influenza.

55
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,150
Or if the patient is hospitalized or

56
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,840
has severe disease, you'll luckily want to
know why the patient's so sick.

57
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,030
For immune compromised patients,

58
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,080
you may want to give experimental
antiviral therapy.

59
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,470
In some patients, you could actually avoid
empiric antibiotic therapy.

60
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,937
The other reason is to place all patients
who have respiratory virus infections in

61
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:10,252
the same area of the hospital.

62
00:03:10,252 --> 00:03:13,057
This is a, this is called cohorting.

63
00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:17,284
It decreases the chance of spreading the
virus to other patients in the hospital.

64
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,424
A third main reason for

65
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:22,215
identifying a virus is to investigate an
epidemic of a respiratory virus.

66
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:25,691
This is important in case the virus found
is a new emerging virus.

67
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:29,225
Now studies are done on respiratory
viruses, which is the only way I

68
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:33,381
can tell you about the clinical syndromes
and seasonalities of these viruses.

69
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:37,250
Identifying viruses is crucial in these
epidemiology studies.

70
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,720
The image on the right shows you how we
obtain samples to identify a virus.

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,160
It is called a nasopharyngeal swab and it
needs to be put all the way to the back of

72
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,690
the nasal pharynx in order to get the
correct sample.

73
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,580
I hope you can see how far you need to
insert the swab.

74
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,894
If you ever had one of these, you know
it's a bit uncomfortable.

75
00:03:55,894 --> 00:03:59,143
But it's very important to do the
collection correctly.

76
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:02,853
Otherwise, you will not be able to
identify the virus.

77
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:05,776
Once you collect the sample, you'll have
to decide what tests to do.

78
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:08,630
And this table shows you the different
methods available.

79
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,400
You will hear about all these different
tests when you start clinics.

80
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,190
Different hospitals use different methods.

81
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,770
For example, until very recently, our
hospital used the first method that

82
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,340
detects viral proteins by antibody testing
for the viral antigen.

83
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,050
These tests are very fast and

84
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,530
we had an entire panel that tested most of
the respiratory viruses.

85
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,660
The disadvantage is that these tests may
be negative if the sample doesn't

86
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,240
have a lot of viral antigen.

87
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,780
This may be because of sample bias or
because it just wasn't collected well.

88
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,261
So now our hospital is using the second
method,

89
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:39,621
which detects viral genetic material with
molecular methods.

90
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:43,040
We now test for more viruses including
rhinovirus.

91
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,540
Vallecular methods are much more
sensitive.

92
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,230
One of the new patterns we are finding are
patients who

93
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,100
have multiple viruses at the same time.

94
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,599
Not all hospitals have this type of test,
because it's quite expensive.

95
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,650
In the past, viral culture was gold
standard.

96
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,910
You can directly isolate the virus, but
this is a slow test and

97
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,530
sometimes you don't even get the answer
until after the patient is better.

98
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,828
The last method is serology.

99
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:09,351
This test looks for the antibody response
to the virus, so

100
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:13,250
it's different compared to the other tests
that I just talked to you about.

101
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,470
It doesn't detect a presence of the virus.

102
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,910
This test can be used after an infection
has cleared.
