1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,820
This next module is actually going to
serve two purposes.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,060
So I want to do a little bit more practice
and enforcement of linear regression.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,720
But I also want to just slip two tools or
tricks into your tool box.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,450
These are some statistical tricks that you
may have occasion to

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,090
use in the future when you're analyzing
your own data.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,780
Now they happen to involve linear
regression, and will help reinforce your

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,760
understanding of linear regression, so I'm
going to slip these in now.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,320
So the first tool that you may end up
wanting to use someday is something I'm

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,770
calling residual analysis.

10
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,930
And basically the idea is that the
residuals from

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,210
a linear regression can sometimes be
useful in and of themselves.

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,820
They can be analyzed as a new variable.

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,360
And this is really just best illustrated
with me giving you some examples.

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,960
Basically, if you have a really key
covariate,

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,600
like a covariate that's going to be a
major, major confounder.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,630
And you actually want to know whether a
person's value is higher or

17
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:08,100
lower than expected, given their level of
this key confounder, this key covariate.

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,270
What you might be after is these
residuals.

19
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,760
So let me just give you some examples
here.

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,460
So, for example, if we're talking about
nutrition data, this is often used for

21
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,050
analyzing nutrition data by the way.

22
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,310
So, imagine you've collected some
nutrition data and nutrition variables,

23
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,510
nutrient variables are highly, highly
related to total caloric intake.

24
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,990
If you're somebody who just eats a lot of
food,

25
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,560
you're going to have high levels of all
the nutrients you can think of, but

26
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,650
that's partly mediated through caloric
intake.

27
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,580
So what if you just wanted to know
specifically about, say,

28
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,940
their calcium intake.

29
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,710
How do you untangle that from the total
caloric intake?

30
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,760
One way to do that is to use the residuals
from a linear regression that regresses

31
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,550
the, their calcium, a person's calcium
intake against their caloric intake.

32
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,830
So you would regress calcium on calories
for that linear regression, and

33
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,984
there's definitely going to be a positive
association there.

34
00:02:00,984 --> 00:02:03,950
because the more you eat, the more calcium
you're going to take in.

35
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:09,240
But the residual analysis will focus on is
a person's value for calcium higher or

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,130
lower than expected, given the amount of
calories they eat.

37
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,900
So if you're somebody who eats a high
amount of calories but

38
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,250
your calcium is way above the line.

39
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,570
This is the residual, remember is the
difference between an observed value and

40
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,100
a value on the line.

41
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,780
This person is a person who for the, the
calories they eat,

42
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,070
eats an unexpectedly high amount of
calcium for that level of calories.

43
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,140
Where as if I had somebody over here,
who's kind of in the middle range for

44
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,760
calories, their expected value for calcium
is on the line here, but

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,710
they are lower than average for their
caloric intake.

46
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,340
So their residual would be negative.

47
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,650
That would be somebody who ate kind of a
lower than expected calcium intake for

48
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,870
the, the cal, their calorie levels.

49
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,490
So we can take these residuals, run this
linear regression,

50
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:59,870
take these residuals and store those
residuals as a new variable and

51
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,610
use those residuals for further analysis.

52
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,760
Just to, to have another example, I'm
going to go through this specific example

53
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,690
with calcium in more detail in just a
second.

54
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,020
But just to show you that that has more
uses than just nutrition,

55
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,870
let me present one other example to you.

56
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,220
So imagine you're doing a study that's
looking at weight loss.

57
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,940
And we know that if you lose weight, so
here's weight lost in the study.

58
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,950
We know if you lose weight, that generally
it improves your lipid profile.

59
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,360
So maybe like you're LDL cholesterol which
you want to be low,

60
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,560
may be that as you lose weight that
generally will go down.

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,010
So more weight lost, the more your LDL
will decrease.

62
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,260
However, there may be individual
variability again.

63
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,290
So here's a person right here, this dot,
who their LDL went

64
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,790
down a lot more than expected for the low
amount of weight loss that they had.

65
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,850
Where as maybe, here's a person who lost a
lot of weight, but

66
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,900
didn't lose as much LDL as expected.

67
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,690
So again, we can store those residuals as
a new variable if what

68
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,520
we care about is trying to figure out
where,

69
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,581
why is there variability in the amount of
LDL improvement after accounting for

70
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:07,660
the amount of weight loss in this weight
loss study, for example.

71
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,920
So this has all sorts of uses.

72
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,575
Let me zoom in on the nutrition one,

73
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:12,590
because that's one that you'll see a lot
in the literature.

74
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,660
So I have some actual data from women
runners that I have from a number of

75
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,710
years back.

76
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:23,620
This particular dataset I was looking at
has 125 women runners in it.

77
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,860
We gave them all a food frequency
questionnaire,

78
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,050
I'm just looking here at the baseline
data.

79
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,480
Food frequency questionnaires are
notorious for

80
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,440
the fact that you know, you basically are
checking off boxes about how much you eat.

81
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,950
Some people will be really lenient in
checking off those boxes and

82
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,210
will end up having high estimated caloric
intake, and

83
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,120
therefore, everything will kind of be
high.

84
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,200
Other people are very stringent in which
boxes they check and may come out with

85
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,510
something as you know, low just because
they, they tend to check less.

86
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,880
So calories and nutrients are going to be
strongly related, and

87
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,590
of course just for real reasons the more
calories you eat,

88
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,760
the more you're going to take in of all
the nutrients.

89
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,940
And you can see that reflected here.

90
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,220
This is the Pearson's Correlation
Coefficient Matrix for,

91
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,030
this is calories, calcium, fat, iron,
vitamin D, and vitamin C.

92
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,780
These are all baseline values.

93
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,020
So what you'll notice is that first of
all, calories is just really key here.

94
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,940
More calories means more overall intake.

95
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,478
So, calories has a, a correlation with
calcium intake of 0.66, with fat of 0.79,

96
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,130
iron 0.74, Vitamin D 0.47, Vitamin C 0.46.

97
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,660
The more you eat, the more you're going to
take in of everything.

98
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,300
And so automatically all of your nutrient
values are going to look high if your

99
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,149
calories are high.

100
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,210
Even beyond that, if you look at
correlations between individual nutrients,

101
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,480
so for example, if I look at vitamin D and

102
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,990
fat, for example, that has a positive
correlation.

103
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,130
All of the correlations in this matrix are
positive.

104
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,600
So, because, if you're a person who eats
more fat, you'll,

105
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,360
you probably eat more calories and if
you're a person who eats more Vitamin D,

106
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,520
you'll probably also eat more calories.

107
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,400
It's going to look like all the nutrients
are highly correlated because again

108
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,320
somebody who just eats more is going to be
high on everything.

109
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,470
And so, we'd like to somehow adjust for
calories.

110
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,600
You can of course put calories in as a
co-variant in your

111
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,760
regression model that's one way to adjust
for it.

112
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,710
But it's slightly better to use this
residual method.

113
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,140
It's going to reveal more things.

114
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,030
it's going to help with answering the
question of is vitamin D,

115
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,640
do vitamin D and fat really go together?

116
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,580
Or is it just that this is reflecting the
fact that more calories mean

117
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,620
more of both of these?

118
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,990
We can tease that apart.

119
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,020
So I'm going to just concentrate on
calcium to have on nutrient to look at it.

120
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,490
This was a study on bone density, so

121
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,830
of course calcium is important for bone
destiny.

122
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,480
So here is the plot I'm plotting.

123
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,060
This is just a baseline values of calories
for

124
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,430
the women in my study, these 125 women.

125
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,440
This is calories per day.

126
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,500
Again, you can see since it's from a food
frequency questionnaire,

127
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,310
some people just check off a lot of boxes
and

128
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,010
they end up with much higher you know,
values and

129
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,080
calories, probably more than they actually
eat, and some people are a little low.

130
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,560
They're probably not really only eating
800 calories a day, but

131
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,090
they just you know, tended to be a little
conservative on checking off the boxes in

132
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,370
the food frequency questionnaire.

133
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,249
This is calcium in milligrams per day.

134
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,140
And what I did here is to fit a regression
line.

135
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,680
So as calories go up, we are expecting
calcium to go up.

136
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,990
What we're interested in though, is for a
given caloric intake,

137
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,760
how far, how much higher or

138
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,190
lower is a person that expected for their
choleric intake, that's the residual.

139
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,270
So, for example, this person right here is
you know, reported on

140
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,480
the food frequency questionnaire eating
more than 4,000 calories a day.

141
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,680
For that level of calories,

142
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,870
we're expecting them to consume 2,000
milligrams of calcium.

143
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,790
In fact they were reported consuming more
than about 3500.

144
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,750
So their residual is going to be something
here like positive 1500.

145
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,450
On the other hand,

146
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,088
this person right here who reported also
eating a lot of calories, but

147
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:59,510
close to 4,000, they're predicted to have
a value of about 2,000 per calcium intake.

148
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,480
But they're little bit lower than that,

149
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,850
they're closer to maybe 1300, so they may
get a residual of like negative 700.

150
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:11,070
So for every person, every person is
going to get this residual calculation,

151
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,550
this person you know, maybe is positive
1,000 or so.

152
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,740
We're going to take these residuals,

153
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,460
we're going to store them in a new
variable called calcium residuals.

154
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,300
So everybody, here's my ID number, so
person one will have a value,

155
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,190
let's say this was person, subject one,
and subject two might have this value.

156
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,980
And subject three might have this value.

157
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,330
So, it just becomes a new variable.

158
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,610
This variable reflects whether a person is
high or

159
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,860
low in calcium for a given caloric intake.

160
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,310
We can do this with all the nutrients.

161
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,360
And this is just showing you the
distribution of the absolute value of

162
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,370
calcium on the left.

163
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,600
So this is just the calcium and the
milligrams per day.

164
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,130
This on the right is the calcium
residuals.

165
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,890
So this now you can see is whether or not
they're, how, how much higher or

166
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,160
lower they are than expected for a given
caloric intake.

167
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,640
What you'll notice is that the calcium
residuals have a much more normally,

168
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,560
a much more normal distribution.

169
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,460
So now this is untangled, on the
right-hand side,

170
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,150
these values are untangled from calories,
they're corrected for calories, and

171
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,490
they have a much nicer distribution, much
more normally distributed.

172
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,770
So that has advantages.

173
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,980
We can now look at the correlation matrix
and as expected.

174
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,752
Now the correlation with calories for all
these nutrients is exactly zero,

175
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:27,910
that's what the residual method will, will
do for you.

176
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,590
Another thing that is very useful here is
that now if you

177
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,085
look at the pair wise comparisons between
the individual nutrients,

178
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:36,390
they're now no longer all positive.

179
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,450
So now you get a better sense of how
actual nutrients go together.

180
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,830
So, for example, here's a good one.

181
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,740
If you look at vitamin C and fat intake,
these are the residuals for vitamin C and

182
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,410
fat, you'll notice that this was, vitamin
C and fat had a slight positive

183
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,650
correlation in the original correlation
matrix before we accounted for calories.

184
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,350
But now it's highly negative.

185
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,460
This makes sense because people who eat a
lot of fruits and vegetables are going to

186
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,090
have a high vitamin C intake, but might
also have a very low fat intake.

187
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,780
So now you're getting real patterns and
you're picking out these real patterns,

188
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,700
these real relationships in the individual
nutrients untangled from calories.

189
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,800
You can take these residuals and use them
in further analyses.

190
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,490
So what I did here was I took the calcium
residuals as my predictor, and

191
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:28,660
my outcome for this is the spine bone
density at baseline for this data set, and

192
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,370
I put in, I set a model with an intercept
plus a beta set for the calcium residuals.

193
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,270
So now rather than putting calcium as an
absolute value,

194
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,530
let's see if that correlates with spine
strength,

195
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,950
bone strength, I've put in the calcium
residuals.

196
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,990
Now, it turns out that you know, the spine
bone density and

197
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,470
the calcium residuals, if you plot them
there's really no relationship.

198
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:55,870
This is a cross-sectional look, so you're,
your calcium intake now may, and just

199
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,220
looking cross sectionally may not have a
lot to do with your current bone density.

200
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,560
And we will see that calcium does is
important at, if you look longitudinally,

201
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,130
but at a cross section it will look, it
sometimes isn't correlated.

202
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,350
So what we found here is just that the
beta is close to zero and

203
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,120
it's not statistically significant.

204
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,600
But that used the calcium residuals in
further analysis.

205
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,760
The second little trick that I want to put
in your toolkit that also involves linear

206
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,870
regression is what I'm calling an
individual slope analysis.

207
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,280
And the idea is this.

208
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,120
Sometimes, we may have a situation where
we want to

209
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,980
actually run a separate linear regression
on each person and

210
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,660
to store those slopes, and those slopes
become a new variable.

211
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:40,230
And this can be useful for, this will be
our segue into repeated measures data

212
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,420
because this can be useful for a simple
way to analyze repeated measures data.

213
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,250
So, imagine that I've got people measured
over time and

214
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,130
I'm looking at say the spine bone density.

215
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,529
This is again a measure of bone strength.

216
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,980
What if I have measured women, say I've
measured them six times.

217
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,840
So here's just a plot for one woman.

218
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,600
So I measured her time point one, a second
time, a third time,

219
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,340
a fourth time, a fifth time, and a sixth
time.

220
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,350
And maybe her data looks like that.

221
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,350
It's only six points, but it's enough to
fit a line.

222
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,150
So, what you could do is actually fit a
linear regression line just for

223
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,690
this one individual woman.

224
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,970
And why would you want to do that?

225
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,980
Well, it simplifies the data.

226
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,320
You've got a, an outcome variable that is
six data points to it.

227
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,770
You can simplify it into a single summary
measure which is the slope of this line.

228
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,510
You can see that there's a lot of
assumptions here.

229
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,380
You're assuming that there's sort of a
linear change over time, and

230
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,390
that change over time is constant.

231
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,630
But that might be reasonable for a lot of
cases.

232
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,720
You will fit a linear regression line for
every person in your data set separately.

233
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,130
You will store those slopes as a new
variable.

234
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,680
And that's perfectly valid to do.

235
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,740
But yet slope will, could be interpreted
as then, as a rate of change

236
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,460
in bone density for a given woman.

237
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,780
So you get a rate of change value.

238
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,550
Now you could of course just you know,

239
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,170
another way to summarize these data would
be to take the first and

240
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,120
last measurement, and say like how much
did she change from first to last.

241
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,440
But that would ignore the intron
measurements that you made, so

242
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,080
this is a way of capturing sort of all
these measurements that you've made

243
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,790
into one summary measurement.

244
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,050
Now next week, subsequent weeks I'm
going to tell you how to actually analyze

245
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,820
all six of those data points and not have
to summarize them into one, but

246
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,980
there may be occasion where you want to
get that summary measure.

247
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,030
So I went ahead and did that.

248
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,900
Now I've got in my example data set of
women runners,

249
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,360
I actually only have three time points, so
it doesn't make the most precise slope.

250
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,760
You know, it's only based on three points.

251
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,360
But you can fit a line to three points
which I've done here.

252
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,280
So this represents on women on the the
left and

253
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,030
then a different women on the right.

254
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,830
The women on the left her slope is
positive the women on the right her

255
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,930
slope is negative.

256
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,580
So her you know, her spine bone density
was going down over time.

257
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,740
These are not big slopes but we can, they
represent the rate of change over time for

258
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,210
bone destiny for these women.

259
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,420
I went and got these slopes for

260
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,370
all 125 women in my data set, and I've
plotted them here in a histogram.

261
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,440
So you can see that bone density wasn't
changing a lot.

262
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,380
These were women who were already adults,
and

263
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,400
you don't change bone density very rapidly
after you've passed adolescence.

264
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,150
But you can see that,

265
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,870
you know, the average rate of change was
somewhere around zero or positive one.

266
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,590
Spine bone density, the average is around
1.0.

267
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:25,000
And the standard deviation for spine bone
density is about 0.1.

268
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,374
So, women are going up like 0.01, 0.02,
maybe as much as 0.03 or

269
00:14:29,374 --> 00:14:30,670
0.04 in bone density.

270
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,380
This is their average rate of change per
year.

271
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,060
I got these just from storing those slopes
as a new variable.

272
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,830
We can then use those slopes as variable,
as a new variable further analysis.

273
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,880
So I went ahead used the slopes as an
outcome variable.

274
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,800
So I said my slopes are my rate of change.

275
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,370
And in this slide, I'm actually looking at
the rate of change in

276
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:58,340
bone mineral content which is just the
total amount of calcium in your skeleton.

277
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,910
I've stored those [UNKNOWN], and I'm
looking to see whether or

278
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:06,840
not a woman's calcium intake or the
calcium in her diet measured as residuals.

279
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,540
The calcium residuals that we just did a
few minutes ago, whether or

280
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,540
not that predicts her rate of change in
bone mineral content,

281
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,470
the amount of calcium in her skeleton over
time.

282
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,120
And it's not quite statistically
significant but it's bordering on it and

283
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,810
it's positive, because it kind of makes
sense if you're somebody who is

284
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,040
eating a lot of calcium in your diet that,
that would predict that

285
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,610
you would be depositing more calcium in
your skeleton over time.

286
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,140
And we do see that, although it doesn't
quite reach statistical significance here.

287
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,010
But those slopes then can be useful for
further analysis.

288
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,099
