1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,030
The final example that I wanted to review
is what's called a combination.

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:11,130
So this is where we are going to stop
considering order,

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,370
formally stop considering order, that's
called a combination.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,560
And combinations are really good for
things like solving,

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,350
what's your probability of winning the
lottery?

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,330
The lottery is one of my favorite things
to talk about in statistics because

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:28,530
it's a little counter-intuitive and a
lottery, so, a typical lottery,

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,770
here's one type of lottery, and one of the
common lotteries works by picking,

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,060
you pick six numbers from 1 to 49.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,850
So you can imagine you've got a little
punch card and they,

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,160
it has all the numbers from 1 to 49, and
you get to punch any six of them.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,720
So there is no replacement here.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,480
You can't pick the same number twice.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,070
So you're picking six numbers from 1 to 49
without replacement.

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,410
And order doesn't matter.

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,930
It doesn't matter if you pick them in any
particular order.

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,279
You're you just want to get the right set
of six.

18
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:02,560
You want to match the set of six
[INAUDIBLE] the lottery authorities get.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,580
So what's your probability of winning that
particular lottery?

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,370
So for the numerator, we're going to say
how many ways you can win?

21
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,640
Well, there's only one way you can win.

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,860
You have to match all six numbers, so
there's only one way you can win.

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,700
In the denominator, we have to count out
how many different sets of six

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,310
numbers can you get when you're
considering the integers from 1 to 49.

25
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,126
And it feels like, most people feel sort
of intuitively like, well,

26
00:01:28,126 --> 00:01:32,800
there's 49 numbers, 1 to 49, and you get
to pick six of them.

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,566
You kind of feel like you're, you're
covering a lot of the space, right,

28
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:37,490
6 out of 49 doesn't seem that small.

29
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,790
You're picking six numbers out of 49.

30
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,980
But, in fact, how many combinations,

31
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,740
how many sets of six numbers are possible
here?

32
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,700
The answer is rather surprising.

33
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,460
In order to be able to calculate that
answer,

34
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,476
we actually need to know something called
the combinations formula.

35
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:57,054
If you want to know more about where this
formula comes from, and

36
00:01:57,054 --> 00:01:58,430
you want to see the derivation in is,

37
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,130
you're going to have to watch the optional
module that goes into that in detail.

38
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,720
But, there's a function out there called
the choosing function.

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,550
And, what the choosing function does is it
says,

40
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,220
if you've got a situation where you have a
set of n objects, you want to

41
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,595
say how many different possible sets of r
of them can you form?

42
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:22,530
That is a choosing function, it's n choose
r.

43
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,752
And we write it with this parentheses with
the, the n,

44
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:30,210
the, the total set, at the top and the r,
the smaller set on the bottom.

45
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,560
So if I have r objects taken from a set of
n objects without replacement and

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,030
ignoring order, this is a combination.

47
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,930
If I want to know how many different
samples,

48
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,800
how many different sets are possible,
that's an n choose r function.

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,720
And you have an n choose r function.

50
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,080
It's just a mathematical function, so what
you do, is you apply this formula.

51
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,550
It's n factorial.

52
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,620
Divided by n minus r factorial times r
factorial.

53
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,510
So that answers the question.

54
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,990
If I've got 49 numbers to choose from and
I want to say how many different

55
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,780
set of six numbers are, are, I can draw,
from within those 49 numbers.

56
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,870
I can just apply the choosing function.

57
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,260
So this will work for solving this lottery
question, and

58
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,240
it works generally, anytime I've got this
same situation, n choose r.

59
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,870
So, let's actually apply it to the lottery
question.

60
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,040
So this take 49 choose 6, function.

61
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,760
How many different combinations of 6
numbers can be formed from those 49

62
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,260
integers, it's a 49 choose 6.

63
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,505
So I just apply the combinations formula,
49 factorial divided by 49-6 or

64
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,750
43 factorial, then divided by 6 factorial.

65
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,720
And we can just do out the factorials
here.

66
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,110
We can do out the numbers and
surprisingly, it turns out,

67
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,480
that 49 choose 6 is almost 14 million.

68
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,509
In other words, there are almost
14,000,000 different

69
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:58,384
sets of 6 numbers that you can derive from
just the 49 integers.

70
00:03:58,384 --> 00:04:03,300
There's 14 million different combinations
that can come out in the lottery.

71
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,100
So, of course, that means that your
probability of winning the lottery

72
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,770
is one out of almost 14 million.

73
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,230
This is a good argument for not bothering
to play the lottery.

74
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,990
We're going to talk more about the lottery
as well, next week.

75
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,534
But your probability is really, really
surprisingly small.

76
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:28,520
I'm actually very happy that the
probability that my probability of

77
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,129
winning the lottery is extremely small
like this.

78
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:35,630
My philosophy on it is, I'm glad there are
really great things in life that

79
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,050
are attached to a very, very small
probability because it turns out there

80
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,390
are also some really horrible, horrible
things in life that are also attached to

81
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,440
extremely, extremely small probabilities.

82
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,900
For example, your probability of dying in

83
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,990
a commercial airline crash is about one in
14 million as well.

84
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,890
So I'm really extremely glad that I'm not
going to win the lottery because that's

85
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,940
the only that I can be confident enough to
get on an airplane is that I know my,

86
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,990
I'm very confident and I'm not going to
win the lottery,

87
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,890
so I can be confident that my airplane is
not going to crash.

88
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,190
So I'm glad for very very very small
probabilities like this.
