1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,595
These data came from a twin study, so each
case is somebody with

2
00:00:05,595 --> 00:00:11,530
Parkinson's disease and they have a twin
who does not have Parkinson's disease.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,598
So we have these case control pairs that
are correlated by the fact that

4
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:17,190
they're within a twin pair.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,060
So we have correlated data here.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,430
Our outcome here is binary.

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,690
You have Parkinson's disease or you don't.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,571
Our exposure variable, our predictor is
whether or

9
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:30,465
not you've been various chemicals.

10
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:35,088
So we have essentially categorical data
for both the predictor and the outcome but

11
00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:37,830
we have this correlation.

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,910
So that's going to tell us that we're
going to have to do a McNemar's test.

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,655
However, if you look carefully at a lot of
these cells.

14
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:48,549
Remember for a McNemar's test, we only
care about the discordant pairs

15
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:52,249
which would be these two middle two
columns.

16
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:57,230
If you look at all of these columns, a lot
of the columns involve sparse data.

17
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,360
So one or two people only in some of those
cells.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,349
So not only do we have to do a McNemar's
test, but

19
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:06,998
we actually have to do an exact test to
calculate those probabilities exactly.

20
00:01:06,998 --> 00:01:09,497
Rather than using a normal approximation
to the binomial,

21
00:01:09,497 --> 00:01:12,350
which is what a Ky square normally would
do.

22
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,329
So we're going to use a McNemar's exact
test here.

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,767
[SOUND].
This question asks you

24
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:23,370
specifically about the probabilities for
PRC.

25
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,395
It's asking you to calculate the p value
for the PERC chemical [INAUDIBLE].

26
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:31,900
It might be helpful here to draw a 2 by 2
table if that helps you to,

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,400
to see the problem.

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,506
So we have your either we have cases.

29
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:47,280
The case is either, these are pair data,
so we have cases and controls.

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,150
So, the cases have Parkinson's.

31
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,135
The control is their twin and we're
analyzing things at the level of pair.

32
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:54,487
So, we have, in this case, then,

33
00:01:54,487 --> 00:01:58,920
what we're looking at here is you were
either exposed to PERC or you weren't.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,790
And some of the cases, both were exposed.

35
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,850
Some of them weren't, both were not
exposed others, there was a discordant.

36
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,130
So it turns out that the majority were not
exposed.

37
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,780
So we had 93 pairs where neither the case
nor the control was exposed.

38
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,278
There weren't any new pairs where both
case and control were exposed, however,

39
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:22,200
we did have a couple of pairs where there
was discordance.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,970
So there were five pairs where the case
that is the person with Parkinson's di,

41
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,112
disease was exposed to this chemical.

42
00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:30,564
But the control was not and

43
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:35,000
we have one situation, one case where the
opposite was true.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,100
The control was exposed to the chemical
but the case was not.

45
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,844
It turns our for McNemar's test the only
thing that's of use

46
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:45,820
the only information that's informative
for us here is the discordant pair.

47
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,690
So we have six discordant pairs.

48
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,170
And the null hypothesis here is that the
chemical is not related to whether or

49
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,390
not you're a case or a control.

50
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,180
So, under the null hypothesis we've got
six discordant pairs.

51
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,790
If there was no relationship between the
chemical and

52
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,440
getting Parkinson's disease, this would
follow a binomial distribution.

53
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,440
X would follow a binomial distribution,
and the n here is 6

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,526
which is just determined by how many
discordant pairs we ended up with.

55
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:18,000
The p would .5 under the null hypothesis.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,518
In other words just think intuitively,

57
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:23,494
if there's not relationship here between
the chemical and Parkinson's disease.

58
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,654
You'd expect there, did, the discord
appears to, kind of,

59
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:29,880
be even about three where it was the case
that it was exposed and not the control.

60
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,800
And three where it was the control that
was exposed and not the case.

61
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,740
The question we're really asking here is,
how far off is a 51

62
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,940
split from what we'd expect under the
normal, which is like a 3 3 split.

63
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,391
So we're on a binomial, we're going to
have to because of small numbers,

64
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,660
we're going to have to calculate that
exact binomial probability.

65
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,235
So we're literally going to go through and

66
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:50,825
calculate the exact binomial probabilities
here.

67
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:52,380
So what did we actually see?

68
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,035
We saw the case where we ended up with
five discordant pairs where it was

69
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:58,080
the case who had been exposed and not the
control.

70
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,050
The binomial probability, we'll just apply
our binomial probability formula here,

71
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,970
we've got six choose five P is 0.5 so we
do 0.5 raised to the fifth, and

72
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:13,760
then one minus P is also 0.5, so we do,
0.5 raised to the first.

73
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,710
But, remember, P values we have to
calculate the probability of what we

74
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,980
saw and everything more extreme.

75
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,205
So we also have to calculate the
probability that we

76
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:27,005
could have gotten all 6 discordant pairs,
it was the case that was exposed, so

77
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:31,270
we do 626.5 raised to the 6th.

78
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,502
We also have to consider, the other tail,

79
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:39,097
remember if we did out all the binomial
probabilities here, they go from 0 to 6.

80
00:04:39,097 --> 00:04:43,377
We could we'd get something that excuse my
crude drawing here.

81
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:45,925
But we get something where we have five
and six and one tail, but

82
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:48,522
we have to consider we would run into a
two tailed hypothesis and

83
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:53,241
consider we could've been just as extreme
in the other direction.

84
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:55,009
And as we could have ended up with only 0
or

85
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:58,670
1 discordant pairs where it was the case
that was exposed.

86
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,920
So we have to do a two tailed probability.

87
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,940
You can do that by, calculating the other
tail which is the probability that x

88
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,610
equals 1 and the probability that x equals
0.

89
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,116
It turns out that those are exactly the
same as the ones that you see here.

90
00:05:13,116 --> 00:05:16,190
So this one comes out to be .015625.

91
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:23,160
This one comes out to be .09375.

92
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:30,421
This one will also be 0.09375 and this one
will 0.019625 when you

93
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:40,130
add all of those up, You get the P value
here is 0.21875.

94
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,652
These is a situation where we have carried
the data, we have repeated measures.

95
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:48,400
It's the same women measured before and
after they smoked.

96
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,325
We have a continuous outcome which is
blood pressure and also heart rate, and,

97
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:53,935
so we are going to be using a paired t
test here because it's a before and

98
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:56,810
after with a continuous outcome.

99
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,400
The correct answer here is false.

100
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,100
You actually cannot calculate the paired t
test here,

101
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,700
from the data given in the table.

102
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,380
Why is that?

103
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,964
Well, we're given the mean before smoking
and the mean after smoking, but

104
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:17,300
remember, the paired T test looks at the
differences for individual women.

105
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,810
And right now, we don't know the
difference values for individual women.

106
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,110
We don't know, how much each woman
individually went up or down.

107
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,194
We would need that information in able to
be able to calculate the paired T test.

108
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:34,417
In this question, breast feeding is a
categorical variable.

109
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:37,517
We're comparing groups of men by whether
they or not they were breastfed or

110
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:41,210
the duration of how they were how much
they were breastfed.

111
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,650
Our outcome variable is binary.

112
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,390
Your either obese or you're not obese.

113
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:50,048
We also do not have sparse data, so we're
going to be using a [UNKNOWN] square test.

114
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:53,072
And because we don't have sparse data we
don't have to worry about

115
00:06:53,072 --> 00:06:56,950
the fisher's exact test, we're doing an
exact test here.

116
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,105
In this case we're going to be comparing
different groups.

117
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:03,453
We're comparing men in different groups of
duration of breast feeding, so

118
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:07,830
that's a categorical predictor, groups,
they are independent groups.

119
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,070
Our outcome variable now is BMI, BMI is a
continuous variable.

120
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,185
We're going to assume that it's normally
distributed or

121
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:18,254
close enough with such large sample sizes
that we can run an anova test here.

122
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:22,514
So this questions says, let's say we do
our ki square test for obesity and

123
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:28,409
breast feeding group, and we get a
significant P value, P is .03.

124
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:30,640
What does that mean?

125
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,102
Well the ki squared test is a global test,

126
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:35,090
what it actually doesn't tell us where the
differences lie.

127
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,180
It just tells us that at least one of
those breast feeding groups is

128
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,760
different than the others.

129
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,024
And if you actually look at the numbers
here, you know,

130
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:45,750
it goes from 9.6% obese to 13.1% to 20.7%.

131
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,790
It looks like it's going up as you get
more breastfeeding, and

132
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,090
then it goes down for the really long
breast feeding group.

133
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,264
So there's no particular pattern here, so
all we can conclude is D, that the percent

134
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:58,660
of obese subjects differs in at least one
of those breast feeding categories.

135
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,330
This asks you to calculate the mean change
in exercise duration.

136
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,590
And you can do it just off the graph.

137
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:11,740
It's nice that they were measured in only
in units of .5, nothing finer than that.

138
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,470
So for example, this first person went up
three seconds.

139
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,910
The next person went up .5, this one was
zero, .5,

140
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:28,682
1.5, zero, 1.5, .5, .5, 1.0, .5, zero, and
.5.

141
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:33,480
You literally just have to pick those up,
up off of the graph.

142
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,696
Well if you add up all of those numbers,

143
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:36,102
I'm not going to write in all those all
out here,

144
00:08:36,102 --> 00:08:38,030
just because it would take a while.

145
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,550
But if you add up all of those numbers
from 1 to 13,

146
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:45,680
you end up and then divide by 13, to
calculate the average here.

147
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,810
You end up with .77.

148
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,054
To calculate the standard deviation of
change here,

149
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:56,170
we're simply going to take each
observation and subtract it from the mean.

150
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,820
Well, you've already calculated the mean
to be 0.77.

151
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,096
So, for example, we take the first person,
subtract the mean square of that,

152
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:04,780
then we do this for the next person.

153
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,560
The next person has a value of 0.5,
subtract from the mean square of that.

154
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,170
We're going to do that for all 13.

155
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,235
I won't write it out completely here.

156
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:15,895
You're then going to divide by n-1.

157
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:18,645
For the standard deviation, you'll always
divide by n-1, so

158
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:21,250
that ends up being 13-1 or 12 here.

159
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,870
And then we would square-root that whole
thing.

160
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:30,580
When you calculate that out, you get a
value of 0.83.

161
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,540
To calculate the standard error of the
change here, we would take this.

162
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,431
Standard deviation for change which we
calculated already as 0.83 and

163
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:39,570
divided by the square root of N.

164
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,700
So, 0.83 divided by the square root of 13
is 0.23.

165
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,310
That would be our standard error here.

166
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,070
To calculate the 95% confidence interval,
we're going to take the observed mean,

167
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,984
which we already calculated to to be 0.77.

168
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:56,854
We're going to add and subtract our t
value here, for

169
00:09:56,854 --> 00:10:00,920
a 99% confidence interval I gave you, is
3.055.

170
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,487
We're going to multiply that by our
standard error,

171
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:08,630
which we calculated already to be 0.23.

172
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,848
When you add that all out,

173
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:13,920
you're going to end up with a confidence
interval of 0.067 to 1.47.

174
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,588
The answer to this question is true.

175
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:20,820
It is statistically significant at the
0.01 level.

176
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,200
How do we know that?

177
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,820
Well we just calculated the 99% confidence
interval.

178
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,030
That confidence interval does not include
the null value which is 0 here.

179
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:37,803
This excludes 0, therefore we can be sure
that the p value is less than .01.

180
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,770
The answer to this question is false.

181
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,844
We did prove that there is a statically
significant increase in

182
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,900
the exercise duration of these patients.

183
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,628
However, it's unclear if the camp is
responsible for

184
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:54,910
this change, they could have all gone up
for other reasons.

185
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,590
We don't have a control group here so we
can't conclude causality here.

186
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:03,231
We just know that for some reason they
went up a significant amount.
