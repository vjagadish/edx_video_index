2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,667
This is the denouement of our series of
lectures on VDJ recombination,

3
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:16,746
because that whole process of VDJ
recombination culminates in

4
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:20,024
the formation of an antibody molecule.

5
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:23,711
And I've drawn for you up here an antibody
molecule.

6
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:27,627
And the antibody molecule consists of two
identical heavy chains, and

7
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:32,560
the two identical heavy chains are heavy
chains because they're bigger.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,620
And I'll show you the heavy chains with
little arrows.

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,623
There's one here.

10
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,066
And there's one there.

11
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:45,157
And two identical light chains.

12
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:54,107
And there are two identical light chains.

13
00:00:54,107 --> 00:00:56,887
One over here and one over here.

14
00:00:56,887 --> 00:00:58,085
Okay.

15
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:02,820
And each of those chains, the light chain
and heavy chain.

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,884
Have in them a variable region and the
variable region has been drawn in black.

17
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:14,863
So the variable regions are in black.

18
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:19,371
Alright, variable regions.

19
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,940
And the colors.

20
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,110
Let's draw a red and blue arrow.

21
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,430
Red and blue arrow.

22
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:33,498
Correspond to constant regions.

23
00:01:33,498 --> 00:01:36,406
The red to the constant region of the
heavy chain and

24
00:01:36,406 --> 00:01:39,324
the blue to the constant region of the
light chain.

25
00:01:39,324 --> 00:01:40,112
Okay.

26
00:01:40,112 --> 00:01:47,010
So, these antibodies can have incredible
variation.

27
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:52,150
In fact, the variation is absolutely mind
boggling and

28
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,620
because these antibodies have to recognize
all kinds of foreign antigens, and I'm

29
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:02,980
going to show you exactly how we get to
such huge numbers using VDJ recombination.

30
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,660
It turns out that we mentioned that there
was a heavy chain gene.

31
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,959
And I'm going to draw for you the heavy
chain gene, okay.

32
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,368
So here's a single heavy chain gene.

33
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,860
And it's the germ line heavy chain gene.

34
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,460
All right, there's the germ line heavy
chain gene, all the way across there.

35
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,937
So long germ line heavy chain gene.

36
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:31,723
And let me just say, germ line, heavy
chain gene.

37
00:02:31,723 --> 00:02:36,380
Heavy chain gene.

38
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,140
So the antibodies a protein but now, we
got a gene.

39
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,640
Germ line heavy chain gene.

40
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,620
And the germ line heavy chain gene
consists of a number of variable regions.

41
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,160
I'm going to draw a few of them.

42
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,930
Dot, dot, dot, okay, and

43
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,920
in the human, it turns out, every animal
is somewhat different.

44
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,860
But, in the human there are roughly 50
variable regions.

45
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,428
Okay, in addition to that, way down
stream,

46
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:19,961
let's put a stagger mark down there, there
are a number of D regions,

47
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:24,749
and I'm going to draw a few of them, dot,
dot, dot.

48
00:03:24,749 --> 00:03:27,459
And so there are a number of D regions and

49
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,004
in fact there are about 25 D regions in
the human.

50
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:35,860
D1, D2, and D25.

51
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,782
Okay.
So,

52
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:41,690
downstream of that, there are a number of
J regions.

53
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,003
And in the human, there are six J regions.

54
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:57,170
Dot, dot, dot, six J regions.

55
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:03,109
[BLANK_AUDIO]

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,429
Okay.
J1, J2, and J6.

57
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:12,036
Okay.

58
00:04:12,036 --> 00:04:17,055
So all of these are a little bit different
so

59
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:22,360
I'm going to make them a little bit
different.

60
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,196
All right.
So there's the heavy chain gene

61
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:24,969
right up here.

62
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:26,882
And as we described before,

63
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:31,506
VDJ recombination picks one of the V
regions, one of the D regions and

64
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:35,431
one of the J regions and brings them
together, all right?

65
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:40,666
So there's a tremendous amount of
diversity that's produced from this

66
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,780
recombination event.

67
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,790
Now, downstream from the J region.

68
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,130
Now I've run out of space so I'm just
going to curl it around, I'm going to

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,230
draw a block corresponding to the constant
region of the heavy chain, and

70
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:00,890
of course, because the anybody has it in
red I'll also draw it in red here.

71
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,510
So this is the constant region for the
heavy chain.

72
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:15,060
All right, and notice that I've drawn the
V,

73
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,590
the D, and the J all in black because
they're going to end up encoding

74
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,810
the variable region of the heavy chain
which is up here.

75
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,270
So how many different variable regions can
we get out of

76
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,860
this single heavy chain gene?

77
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:40,200
Well, for any one of the J regions, you
can have 25 different D regions,

78
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:46,050
but there are six J regions, each of which
can go with 25 V regions.

79
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,250
So, the number of D to J combinations.

80
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:55,070
Let me draw it in black to emphasize.

81
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,715
Gotta get the colors.

82
00:05:59,715 --> 00:06:02,660
[BLANK_AUDIO]

83
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,640
You can get 25 times six D to J
combinations.

84
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:13,220
But each of these D to J combinations can
go with any one of 50 V regions.

85
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,340
So, you can get a total of

86
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:25,310
50 times 25 times six recombinants from V,
D, and J.

87
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:32,837
So 50 times 25 times six is equal to 7500.

88
00:06:32,837 --> 00:06:34,885
7,500.

89
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:44,014
So from one gene, you can get 7,500
different heavy chains just by [UNKNOWN].

90
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,004
Alright.
But that's not all,

91
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:50,940
because remember, there are light chain
genes.

92
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,960
And so there are two kinds of light chain
genes.

93
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,126
There is a kappa light chain gene and a
lambda light chain gene.

94
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:06,430
So the germ line kappa light chain gene,
kappa light chain.

95
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,479
[BLANK_AUDIO]

96
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,590
Looks like this.

97
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:21,897
It has a number of V regions and a number
of J regions,

98
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:27,780
upstream of a constant region, so, we're
going to make that blue.

99
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,390
Alright.

100
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,160
And so we have a number of V regions in
the kappa light chain.

101
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,449
Dot, dot, dot.

102
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:50,447
V1, V2 and in the Kappa light chain in
humans anyway,

103
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:56,476
there are about 40 of these, and then
downstream of them,

104
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:03,708
there are some J regions and the J regions
look like so, dot, dot, dot.

105
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:11,780
And there are five J regions, J1, J2, and
J5.

106
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,654
So, how many recombinants can we get from
the kappa light chain for

107
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:15,795
each one of the J regions?

108
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,820
We can have 40 V Regions.

109
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,059
So there are a total of 40 times five, but
there's also a lambda light chain.

110
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,510
Now, it's interesting.

111
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:32,327
The lambda light chain, looks a little bit
different and,

112
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:37,909
actually, if you go to the chapter on gene
duplication,

113
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:43,867
the beginning, the very origins of the VDJ
recombination.

114
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:48,245
You can imagine that the duplication could
have occurred in a way to

115
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:50,444
produce the lambda light chain.

116
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:53,580
It's just a little bit of a different
pattern of duplication.

117
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:59,537
So, the way the duplication happened was
for

118
00:08:59,537 --> 00:09:05,470
the lambda light chain [SOUND] dot dot
dot.

119
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,350
There are a total of also about 40 V
regions.

120
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,640
Okay.
[BLANK_AUDIO]

121
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,070
And then there are four

122
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,820
J segments, each of which is upstream with
its own constant region.

123
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,802
So the gene duplication that occurred.

124
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:25,360
[BLANK_AUDIO]

125
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,490
Is, looks like this.

126
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,750
So here's one J region.

127
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,280
Upstream of its own constant region, I'm
going to draw a different kind of

128
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,830
constant region because this is now the
lambda light chain.

129
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,896
And then, there's another J region.

130
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:49,737
And dot dot dot, let's just save some time
here.

131
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:51,851
Another J region.

132
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:57,436
And there's a total of four of these, so

133
00:09:57,436 --> 00:10:03,530
J4, upstream of its own constant region.

134
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,140
So as a result of this, we have a total,
for the kappa light chain,

135
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,520
we have a total of 40 times five
possibilities.

136
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,290
For the lambda light chain we have a total
of 40 times four possibilities.

137
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,230
So the total number of different ways you
can have light chains

138
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,282
is 40 times five, plus the number of ways
that you can lambda,

139
00:10:29,282 --> 00:10:33,660
that's the number of the ways you can have
kappa light chains.

140
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,020
Plus the number of ways you can have
lambda light chains, so this is kappa.

141
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,850
Kappa.
And the number of ways you can have lambda

142
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:49,314
light chains which would be 40 times four,
that's lambda, okay?

143
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:57,470
And that equals 200 plus 160, that equals
360.

144
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,280
So.

145
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,010
Every antibody has to have two identical
heavy chains and

146
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,590
two identical light chains.

147
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,704
There are a total of 7,500 different
combinations that can produce a heavy

148
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:16,522
chain, and a total of 360 different ways
you can produce a light chain.

149
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:22,088
The germ, the germ line heavy chain gene
undergoes VDJ recombination.

150
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:31,130
[BLANK_AUDIO]

151
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,780
And the light chains undergo VJ
recombination.

152
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,699
That's why the D is in parentheses.

153
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:43,500
Because heavy chain does the D, and light
chains only do V and J.

154
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,363
So the total number of combinations of
heavy chain and

155
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:52,155
light chain is 7,500 times 360.

156
00:11:52,155 --> 00:11:55,678
7,500.

157
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:59,006
Times 360.

158
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:07,007
And that equal 2,700,000.

159
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:09,130
A truly staggering number.

160
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,228
So just by common [UNKNOWN], three measly
little genes.

161
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:18,279
One germ line heavy chain gene and two
different light chains, kappa and lambda.

162
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,233
Three genes can produce 2,700,000
different combinations.

163
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:29,360
That gives you incredible diversity in, in
coding for antibodies.

164
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,640
And as a result of that, we can fight off
infections from bugs that we haven't

165
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,960
even seen before, because we have that
many different ways of making antibodies.

166
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,082
Now contrast this to another strategy
which would be to make a separate gene for

167
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:48,764
every different antibody that you could
make.

168
00:12:48,764 --> 00:12:53,100
You would have to make 2,700,000 different
genes.

169
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,743
Well it turns out our genome really
doesn't have enough room for

170
00:12:56,743 --> 00:13:00,864
that because the human genome contains
only about 20,000 genes.

171
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:05,061
So there's no way you could have an immune
system with this kind of diversity if

172
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:09,150
you didn't use the common [UNKNOWN] that
are involved in VDJ recombination.

173
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:14,510
So you've got 2,700,000 different ways to
make antibodies out of three genes.

174
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,020
And so you're only using up three out of
your 20,000 genes to make antibodies.

175
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,720
Pretty amazing.

176
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,220
Thank you.
