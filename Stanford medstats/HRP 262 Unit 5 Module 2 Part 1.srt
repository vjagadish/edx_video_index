[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,580
In this next module I'm going to tell you
about the intention-to-treat principle,

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,240
which is applied when you have data from a
randomized clinical trial.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,790
And, this is not specific to survival
analysis.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,180
So, you would apply the intention-to-treat
principle whether you had time-to-event

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,085
data or whether you had some other type of
outcome data, from your clinical trial.

7
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:29,487
So, first of all, what's meant by an
intention-to-treat analysis.

8
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,973
The idea is this, you do a randomized
trial.

9
00:00:31,973 --> 00:00:34,230
You randomize people to different groups.

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,646
If you're using an intention-to-treat
analysis you're going to

11
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:41,672
compare outcomes according to the groups
to which subjects were randomized,

12
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:44,356
regardless of what happened after
randomization.

13
00:00:44,356 --> 00:00:47,589
So, in the real world, in real world
trials, lots of people,

14
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,395
as I'm going to show you in some examples
in this module,

15
00:00:50,395 --> 00:00:54,300
lots of people will end up switching
groups or violating the protocol.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,866
All sorts of things can happen.

17
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:59,170
For, if you're doing a true
Intention-to-treat analysis you're

18
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,074
going to ignore all that essentially, and

19
00:01:01,074 --> 00:01:04,340
just analyze the outcomes to what you were
originally randomizing.

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,350
So a nice way to summarized that is once
randomized, always analyzed.

21
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:15,140
And that's well-illustrated if you just
look at the flow diagram.

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,080
Most randomized trials will present one of
these flow diagram which shows, you know,

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,600
who was screened for this study, who was
randomized to what group,

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,450
what happened, how many people were
analyzed.

25
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,460
It's very easy to tell, if the authors
have used an intention-to-treat analysis.

26
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,960
Let me zoom in here.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,200
So, this is just a flow diagram from the
dietary intervention component of

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,620
the Women's Health Initiative.

29
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,740
But, here's the key to telling if you've
done an intention to treat analysis.

30
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:47,060
So, notice we had in this trial 48,000
women randomized.

31
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,220
About 29,000 to the usual diet group, and
19,000 to this diet intervention.

32
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,232
And, notice those exact numbers in 19,541
29,294, and

33
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:59,945
then you can scroll down and see all these
other things happen.

34
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:03,257
Some people withdrew, some people lost to
follow-up.

35
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,361
Some people died.

36
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:09,053
But, how many people were analyzed in the
primary analysis at the end of the day?

37
00:02:09,053 --> 00:02:12,020
19,541 in the dietary intervention group.

38
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,210
And 29,294 in the control group.

39
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,123
Notice these are identical to the numbers
who were randomized.

40
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:24,211
This would indicated that they've done a
true intention-to-treat analysis.

41
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,720
So, intention-to-treat says, that
participants are going to be

42
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,380
counted in the intervention group to which
they were originally assigned,

43
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,500
even if they refuse the intervention
immediately after randomization.

44
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,570
If they dis, discontinued it sometime
during the study,

45
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,960
even if they followed the intervention
incorrectly,

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,440
even if they violated study protocol, they
missed follow-up measurements.

47
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,040
Even if it was found after randomization
and

48
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,060
that they should've been excluded from the
trial in the first place.

49
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,140
All these things we're going to ignore and
once randomized, always analyzed.

50
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,140
That's the pure form of
intention-to-treat.

51
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,280
And you can see that in real-world trials,
lots of things like this do happen.

52
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,270
'Kay so here is a nice figure that was

53
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,310
presented from the Women's Health
Initiative.

54
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,940
This was from the main trial.

55
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,390
The Women's Health Initiative was a large,
randomized trial, that was designed to

56
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,180
compare postmenopausal hormones to a
placebo pill in postmenopausal women.

57
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,869
And see whether or not hormones, which at
the time were thought to be very good for

58
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:27,286
postmenopausal women, whether they, in
fact, had benefits.

59
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:30,448
And, what you're seeing here is, the
circles are women who

60
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:33,920
were originally randomized to the estrogen
and progestin group.

61
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,408
That's the hormone group.

62
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:39,004
The, the triangles are women who were
originally randomized to

63
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:40,058
the placebo group.

64
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:44,522
But, what this graph is showing you is,
what are called the drop-ins and dropouts.

65
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:47,870
It shows you how much crossover there was
during this trial among

66
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,300
the different groups.

67
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:56,052
So, this filled in circles are women who
dropped out of the active treatment group.

68
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:57,650
So, they stopped taking their hormones.

69
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,280
They were randomized to hormones, and they
stopped taking them for whatever reason.

70
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,513
You can see by the end of the trial, we're
talking 35% and or

71
00:04:03,513 --> 00:04:06,563
more of women in that treatment have
actually dropped out of

72
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:10,064
the treatment group, they're no longer
taking their hormones.

73
00:04:10,064 --> 00:04:13,088
Why might this be, well people get sick of
taking pills.

74
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:16,920
Also they may have perceived there were
side effects from those pills.

75
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,952
What's really interesting is that the
placebo group also had a very high dropout

76
00:04:21,952 --> 00:04:26,994
rate, and it's almost as high but just a
little bit less than the hormone group.

77
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:30,110
So, that's this filled-in triangle line
below.

78
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,260
That's the dropout rate over time, for
those who are taking placebo pills.

79
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,910
Remember, the women were blinded they
didn't know whether or

80
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,310
not they were on hormones or placebos, so
some of the women either perceived that

81
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,460
they were having side effects on the
placebo pill.

82
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,600
Or they just, you know, got sick of taking
a pill or forgot or whatever.

83
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,408
And the rate of dropouts was almost as
high in the placebo group,

84
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:48,617
which I find interesting.

85
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:52,673
And then besides dropouts we also have,
had,

86
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:56,529
people dropping into the treatment group.

87
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,530
So women on the placebo pill,

88
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,709
this is the triangles here on the bottom,
dropped into the treatment.

89
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:06,704
So at the time the paradigm was that
hormones are good for

90
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:12,077
you, plus menopausal hormones are good,
and so the women weren't sure.

91
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:14,849
The women in the placebo group weren't
sure they were on the hormones, and

92
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:16,135
maybe suspected they weren't.

93
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:17,845
And so they actually went to their or

94
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:21,550
their doctor recommended to them, if they
get a prescription for hormones.

95
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,522
So they dropped into the hormone group,

96
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:25,784
they stopped taking their placebo pills,
and

97
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:29,728
actually dropped into the hormone group,
thinking that they should be on them.

98
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:33,490
And then finally, there were women who
were actually on hormones,

99
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,591
this is the last graph here, who decided
to stop taking their study drug.

100
00:05:37,591 --> 00:05:40,470
Maybe they weren't sure if they had been
assigned to the hormone group.

101
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,130
And decided to go and get a prescription
for the, those hormones.

102
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,080
So, women in the estrogen and

103
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,240
progestin group actually dropped into
active treatment.

104
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,150
So, they stopped taking their study drugs
and went out and got a prescription for

105
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,110
the same thing essentially.

106
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,310
Because, again, women are blinded, and
they might have wanted to be on hormones.

107
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,140
So you can see that there's a whole bunch
of noise in the study.

108
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,810
Women don't stay in the groove to which
they were assigned in this study.

109
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,460
And yet the intention to treat principle
is going to say all the ones who

110
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,410
are circles are going to be analyzed as
treatment group, active treatment.

111
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,810
And all the ones who are triangles are
going to be analyzed as placebo,

112
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,710
at the end of the day.

113
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,190
Now you might be wondering why we would
use intention to treat.

114
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,450
What's the rationale here?

115
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,690
now, it might not your instinct to say
okay,

116
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,370
we're just going to keep everybody in the
original groups.

117
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,090
You might think, well,

118
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,970
we should account for the fact there's all
this switching around.

119
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,710
So what's the rationale for intention to
treat?

120
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,850
There's sort of two basic reasons.

121
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,180
So first of all, if you're using intention
to treat analysis,

122
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,150
you're preserving the benefits of
randomization.

123
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,310
So the whole point of randomization was to
balance potential confounding factors in

124
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,000
the study arms.

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,490
Make sure those arms are balanced.

126
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,900
In things that can be confounders.

127
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,800
If you then go and look and

128
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,880
say well okay I'm not going to analyze
according to the randomization, but

129
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,880
I'm going to go analyze according to who
took hormones and who didn't.

130
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,590
Then you bring a whole set of confounders
and biases back in to this study, right.

131
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,870
The balance will no longer be preserved,

132
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,010
if you're analyzing women according to
what they actually did.

133
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,080
And again, these can be large numbers of
women, or people, in randomized trials,

134
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,180
switching around groups.

135
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,670
So, you lose all those benefits of
randomization by doing intentioned,

136
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,780
if you don't do intention to treat, by
doing intention to treat,

137
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,270
you can preserve the benefits of
randomization.

138
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,700
So that's one rationale.

139
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,750
The second rationale is that it more
closely simulates real life.

140
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,370
So it's the intention-to-treat as opposed
to the actual treatment, and

141
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,590
that's more similar to what happens when
you go to a doctor's office.

142
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,270
The doctor prescribes you a drug, that
doesn't necessarily mean that

143
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,630
every patient is going to go home and take
that drug perfectly.

144
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,770
So patients often don't adhere perfectly
to treatment regimens.

145
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,030
They might discontinue treatment
altogether.

146
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,810
So it's evaluating not how good the drug
is under perfect,

147
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,130
ideal conditions, but how good the drug is
under real word conditions.

148
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,250
If you prescribe it, how likely is it to
have a benefit.

149
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,380
So it's getting more at effectiveness.

150
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,220
Rather than efficacy, which is probably
what we care most about, in most cases,

151
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,240
we want to look at real life opposed to
perfect use.

152
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,150
So those sort of the main two rationales
for using intention to treat analysis.

153
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,200
Now, what effect does intention to treat
have on a statistical analysis?

154
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,200
So basically, we are preserving the
benefits of randomization, so

155
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,040
we're not going to introduce any bias
here.

156
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,210
We're going to avoid that you know,
confounding.

157
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,130
However, we there's going to be all of
this noise that's introduced by

158
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,180
the fact that people didn't actually do
what we think they did, or

159
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,680
what they should have done.

160
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,030
And so that noise is going to have the
effect of diluting our effect sizes.

161
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,150
So it's going to reduce our statistical
power.

162
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,250
If you use an intention-to-treat analysis,

163
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,720
you tend to underestimate treatment
effects.

164
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,420
So you don't get a bias in there, but you
tend to, bring things closer to the null.

165
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,210
We had this additional variability which
sort of waters down the results,

166
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,970
reduces your statistical power.

167
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,960
And it's really easy to illustrate that
with a simple mathematical example.

168
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,120
So, let me just do a simple hypothetical,
mathematical example here to illustrate

169
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,160
how it's going to water down our affect
sizes, make them closer to the null.

170
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,050
So, take the following hypothetical
randomized control trial.

171
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,170
Imagine that you have a drug that actually
is effective, and it's really,

172
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,340
really good actually.

173
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,170
So if you take the drug perfectly,

174
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,720
you have a 25% chance of dying during two
years.

175
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,510
Versus, if you don't take the drug,

176
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,670
a placebo subject would have a 50% chance
of dying.

177
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,803
If that's really the truth out there, then
that's a really good drug.

178
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:39,060
'because it's cutting the risk of death in
half.

179
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,406
The true relative risk here.

180
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:45,380
Would be 0.5, 50% less chance of dying in
the treated group.

181
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,740
So now, sort of, if everybody took the
drug perfectly.

182
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,990
But imagine you go out and do a 2-year
randomized trial.

183
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,650
You have a hundred treated subjects and a
hundred placebo subjects.

184
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,720
If everybody took the drug perfectly.

185
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,240
Nobody switched groups.

186
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,070
You would expect to see about 25 deaths in
the treated group, because there's a 25%

187
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:07,010
chance of dying in the treated group, and
about 50 deaths in the placebo group.

188
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,400
And, of course, you know, give or take a
few due to random choice.

189
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,490
We're not going to get exactly 25, we may
get 26, or 24, something around that.

190
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,790
And so the observed relative risk that
you're going to see it's going to be

191
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,940
somewhere around 0.5, maybe not exactly
0.5 but somewhere around 0.5.

192
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,920
Now imagine that things happen in the
trial, as in most trials.

193
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,950
Start people do in fact switch groups.

194
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,940
So if, fairly early in the study about 25
treated subjects switch to

195
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,995
the placebo stop taking their treatment
group, their treatment drug, and

196
00:10:35,995 --> 00:10:39,820
25 placebo subjects stop taking the
placebo and actually go out and

197
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,660
get the treatment, which actually did
happen.

198
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,890
In the women's health initiative, for
example.

199
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,840
Then, what effect is that going to have on
our relative risk at the end of the day?

200
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,750
Well, now because some of the placebo
participants are actually taking the drug

201
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,680
and getting the benefit of it, we're
actually going to see fewer deaths

202
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,390
in the placebo group, maybe 43 or 44
rather than about 50.

203
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,380
And since some of the people in

204
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,760
the treated group are no longer getting
the benefits of the drug,

205
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,740
we're going to expect to see a few higher
deaths than the treated group.

206
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,200
So maybe something around 31, if you want
the math.

207
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,000
So the observed relative risk is going to
be something closer to one.

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,940
So if you kind of estimate it out,

209
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,894
you'd expect to see something around 0.7
even though the true value is 0.5.

210
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:27,400
You're getting closer to the null, it's a
diluted effect, and that's the general

211
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,310
effect that doing an intention-to-treat
analysis is going to have on your results.

212
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,400
So, that often, for many randomized, for
most randomized trials,

213
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,830
they do some kind of intention-to-treat
analysis as their primary analysis.

214
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:45,580
Let me just review what the alternatives
to intention-to-treat analysis would be.

215
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,270
So you see in the literature a lot of
times what people actually do is

216
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,080
not a pure, pure intention-to-treat
analysis but

217
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,520
is actually what's called a modified
intention-to-treat analysis.

218
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,130
This is actually probably more common in
the literature.

219
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,330
A pure intention-to-treat would say, once
randomized always analysed, and,

220
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,710
end of story.

221
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,380
But sometimes people will allow some
limited exclusions and

222
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,080
still call it an intention-to-treat.

223
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,400
That's technically then, a modified
intention-to-treat.

224
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,500
So for example, if you were doing a
vaccine trial for

225
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,500
an HIV vaccine, and after you randomized
people,

226
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,548
you discovered that there were a few
people in each of your groups.

227
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:28,020
Who were HIV-positive before the study
actually started,

228
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,210
because it takes time to do the testing
and everything.

229
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,030
You might find out after the fact, after
they were already enrolled and

230
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,620
randomized, that they, in fact, are
already HIV-positive.

231
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,960
And therefore really shouldn't have been
eligible for he trial.

232
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,480
Do you then go back and exclude them?

233
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,170
Because clearly the vaccine can't protect
them.

234
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,510
Or do you keep them in the analysis?

235
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,040
Well a modified intention-to-treat, for
example, might allow you to exclude them.

236
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,180
You want to be a little bit careful though
when you see studies that

237
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,090
have a modified intention-to-treat.

238
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,150
And the reason is, that there may be good
rationale for

239
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,868
excluding a couple of participants.

240
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:03,310
But modified intention-to-treat really is
not applied

241
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,590
consistently in the literature.

242
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,520
There's really a lack of standards here.

243
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,940
And it opens up the door that authors
could then either consciously or

244
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,230
unconsciously, you know, say after the
fact, oh well,

245
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,410
maybe I should've excluded this type of
participant.

246
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,060
And if I exclude these types of
participants,

247
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,620
let me see how that affects my p value.

248
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,510
People aren't always, you know, trying to
do this purposely, but

249
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,745
you can see how it would open the door to
creeping in a little bit of bias.

250
00:13:29,745 --> 00:13:33,110
because it then gives you the opportunity
to exclude certain participants.

251
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,340
Perhaps, you know, the ones who didn't
have the outcome you were hoping for.

252
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,730
So you want to be really careful when you
see things where there are exclusions

253
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,814
after the fact.

254
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:47,770
And preferably those exclusions would have
been defined in the protocol,

255
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,220
before anybody saw the data.

256
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,740
If you're making those modifications after
you see the data,

257
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,270
there is an opportunity to introduce bias,
so be just a little wary of those.

258
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,560
More dramatic alternatives to
intention-to-treat,

259
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,570
where you're truly not doing
intention-to-treat in any way anymore,

260
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,340
would include the as-treated analysis and
the per-protocol analysis.

261
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,190
So an as-treated analysis, would analyze
participants according to

262
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,220
what actually happened, what treatments
they actually took.

263
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,970
So if you think of the women's health
initiative, study for example.

264
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,680
In Cox regression you can have time
changing predictors, so that's great

265
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,940
because you can see over time women
started, started drugs or stopped drugs.

266
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,500
You could change their status.

267
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,630
You could change which group they were in
over time.

268
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,620
And that would be an as-treated analysis.

269
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,230
It would actually incorporate the fact
that they dropped in or

270
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,740
off, or out, you know.

271
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,610
Onto or off of drugs.

272
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,560
That would be an as treated analysis.

273
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,120
A per-protocol analysis is even stricter
than that.

274
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,860
And it's going to drop, exclude everybody
from the analysis, who,

275
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,530
essentially wasn't a perfect participant.

276
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,780
Who violated the study protocol in any
way, so they, they switched groups, or

277
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,010
they didn't come in for all of their
followup measurements or, you know,

278
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,720
they, they shouldn't have been in the
study in the first place.

279
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,620
Whatever reasons, that's going to be an
even more exclusive analysis.

280
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,760
And you can imagine that the problem with
these non-intention-to-treat analyses,

281
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,520
the as treated in the per-protocol,

282
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,800
is that you're losing the benefits of
randomization.

283
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,670
So now all of a sudden you're analyzing
people according to what they

284
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,410
actually did.

285
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,680
And of course, the reasons that they did,
they went in one group or

286
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,300
another, that they took the drug or

287
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,110
didn't, that they came in for their study
measurements or didn't.

288
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,650
All of those things could be related to
the outcomes.

289
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,900
So you're essentially getting back to an
observational study.

290
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,830
It's no longer a, you no longer have all
the benefits of a randomized trial.
