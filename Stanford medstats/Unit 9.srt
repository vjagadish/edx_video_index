1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,838
In this unit we are going to actually
spend a little bit of time about talking,

2
00:00:10,838 --> 00:00:16,342
about what are some of the different
methods or tools, that are available to

3
00:00:16,342 --> 00:00:22,440
assist you with communicating in a
situation that requires some action.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,586
And so one of the things that we wanted to
spend a little time looking at

5
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:33,479
is looking at some tools that have been
used an other healthcare organization,

6
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,280
that at least has some degree of a track
record and some success.

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,350
To enhance or improve communication
between temp team members in the event of

8
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,320
a, medical situation.

9
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,282
TeamSTEPPS, which stands for Team,
Strategies, and

10
00:00:51,282 --> 00:00:55,483
Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient
Safety.

11
00:00:55,483 --> 00:01:00,443
It's an initiative that was actually
funded by

12
00:01:00,443 --> 00:01:06,054
the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality.

13
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:13,062
The intent of the course program, the
TeamSTEPP program is to give organizations

14
00:01:13,062 --> 00:01:19,360
some tools to be able to work more
effectively, in reducing medical events.

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,350
The Department of Defense Army and Navy
and Airforce installations.

16
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,949
Were involved with developing the concept
because they recognized,

17
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:37,548
early on how critical it was that, there
was a standardized methodology of

18
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:43,580
communicating between the team members
involved with taking care of patients.

19
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,478
The, core focus of the program is actually
to improve the teamwork,

20
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,580
as well as having methodology to improve,
improve the team communication.

21
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,359
And what they had developed was basically
a standardized tool kit

22
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,004
through a series of training sessions to
actually get

23
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:07,621
the team members involved together to go
through these vignettes or

24
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:13,318
scenarios, so that they can understand how
their communication methodologies.

25
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,466
How how and what they're communicating can
be taken so that the staff

26
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:24,020
involved can be able to act appropriately
based on the information they're given.

27
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Since AHRQ had funded the initial
initiative, they have,

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,870
had hundreds of organizations participate
in, master trainer, type

29
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,040
courses that they have held throughout the
country over the last several years.

30
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,720
And the whole concept behind these master
trainer courses, which are at this

31
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,760
moment free to teams of folks coming from
different facilities to register and

32
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,744
participate in these two day programs.

33
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:56,374
The intent of the master trainer courses
is to train trainers, so

34
00:02:56,374 --> 00:02:59,872
that they can go into their individual
organization, and

35
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:04,040
work with their own team, in terms of
rolling out the TeamSTEPPS concept.

36
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,497
Many organizations have applied this
concepts over the past ten years,

37
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:15,607
with a fair amount of success, and
primarily because this is evidence based,

38
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:20,498
research based information in terms of
changing the attitude of team members,

39
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:24,245
improving the team communication among the
team members.

40
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:30,185
The two challenge rule was designed by the
airline industry to help

41
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:36,224
airline pilots prevent disasters when
basically excellent pilots

42
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:41,570
experience a momentary lapse in judgement
or decision making,

43
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:47,920
because of the volume of information
inputted into the individual.

44
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,120
You know, all the red lights are going
off, the alarms are screaming,

45
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,880
people are yelling and shouting, you can
imagine in a crisis situation with

46
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,850
an airplane, you know, the pilot's trying
to make the right decision.

47
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,974
And doesn't always hear or process the
input of information that you may

48
00:04:06,974 --> 00:04:11,070
have in terms of dealing or addressing the
issue on hand.

49
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,534
So, the process works out by actually,

50
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:20,514
if you're the one whose aware of the
situation or aware of record data or

51
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:25,743
key data, you should be able to voice a
concern by basically advocating and

52
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:30,500
asserting, at least twice if the initial
assertion is ignored.

53
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,610
So you know, ability to be able to call
something else, raise the flag,

54
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,220
raise the attention, you know is part of
this two challenge rule process.

55
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,548
Realistically, we're talking about the
first challenge really should be

56
00:04:44,548 --> 00:04:45,150
a question.

57
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,220
So this could very well be something like,
you know,

58
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,600
do you need assistance with starting that
line?

59
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,515
Especially if, you know, you have a
patient who may be septic and

60
00:04:56,515 --> 00:04:59,907
you're trying, you know, you're trying to
get some fluid boluses,

61
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:03,080
performed to try to raise the patient
blood pressure.

62
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,160
The second challenge,

63
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,090
really should be able to provide some
support to your concern.

64
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,560
You know, you're very focused on dealing
with the very overall care of the patient.

65
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,539
Do you want me to go ahead and start that
line as per protocol?

66
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,470
So, you know, you provided some,
restatement of the original issue and

67
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,410
then provide some support for your
concern.

68
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,034
The key thing about this is that,

69
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:29,540
remember that you're always thinking about
advocating for your patient.

70
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,314
And the individual who is leading that
particular response in an urgent or

71
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:38,318
emergent situation is probably momentarily
locked up or

72
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:43,477
frozen with all the amount of information
and decision making process that

73
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:47,710
needs to be involved with taking care of
the situation.

74
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,560
The second part of the two challenge rule
is what they said,

75
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,860
what they oftentimes describe as making it
happen.

76
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,558
And, in some cases, that you know you're
in a clinical event, requiring critical,

77
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:06,294
key decision, and if you have knowledge
and experience and know what to do,

78
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:10,660
then the third part of this two challenge
rule is actually, you know,

79
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,900
making it happen, providing it is safe.

80
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,080
And for the patient and you do know what
needs to be done, very precisely, so,

81
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,760
that's the two challenge rule.

82
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,536
The analogy that the airline industry
makes reference to, is many times you have

83
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:32,860
a pilot and a copilot, and they're dealing
with all kinds of issues and events.

84
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,125
At some time a pilot is so focused on what
is going on, that sometime a question

85
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:43,066
to cause a pause in what is going on, can
be a rebooting or retriggering of

86
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:48,740
the thought process that needs to be done
to address the crisis situation on hand.

87
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,077
The same could be said in an operating
room, an ICU, and

88
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:57,485
emergency department, that sometimes what
it takes is that pause, that question.

89
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:00,145
We've all seen the television shows and

90
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:04,905
the movie where somebody literally slaps
that person in the face, and we're not

91
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:09,735
suggesting that, but the idea is to take
them out of there lock-up moment, and to

92
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:15,660
get them restarted or recharged so that,
they can be able to address the situation.

93
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,435
SBAR, some of you might have heard of
SBAR,

94
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:23,985
which actually was derived from the United
States Nuclear Naval Program, and

95
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:28,485
it was really designed to be a concise
standardized approach method for

96
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:32,150
communicating key information in a moment
of urgency.

97
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:39,490
This information is usually crisis or
urgent type in nature,

98
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:45,450
the mundane, the routine thing, may not
have a place for SBAR.

99
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,038
But is pretty standard in healthcare, many
organization including

100
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:55,276
Stanford Hospital and clinic, has been
using SBAR for several years.

101
00:07:55,276 --> 00:08:00,604
Folks say, well hey in an urgent situation
give me an SBAR or can, you know, can, can

102
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:05,730
you give me SBAR that actually highlights
or focus in on what the issue is.

103
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,637
For those of you that are not familiar
with SBAR, S stands for

104
00:08:08,637 --> 00:08:10,460
what's the situation?

105
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,767
Basically a quick to the point state the
problem, state the issue,

106
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:19,649
B, the background, brief relevant
information.

107
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:26,472
We don't necessarily need to have the
entire patient's comprehensive, you know,

108
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:31,400
history and physical examination but it
may be relevant information as

109
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,550
pertained to the reason why you're calling
for assistance.

110
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,170
A stands for assessment, what do you think
is going on or, and or

111
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,720
what is the problem?

112
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:49,152
Recognizing that, you know, many of us, we
come up with a differential,

113
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:53,690
differential diagnosis that may list
everything under the sun.

114
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,640
Maybe you want to think of the two or
three key things that might be

115
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,650
contributing to what's causing this
situation to occur.

116
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,520
So it kind of gives the receiver of that
information a little guidance or

117
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,850
a little idea that.

118
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,205
You kind of thought through the process,
you've evaluated, and

119
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:13,231
now you're coming up on what you think's
going on, and that leads us to the R,

120
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:15,320
which is recommendations.

121
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,790
Basically those are offers of suggestions
or

122
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,210
requests, you know, it could be anything
that you think may be pertinent or

123
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,630
relevant to be able to address the
situation.

124
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:31,318
So, SBAR is a very common methodology,
it's often time used in the nursing world,

125
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:36,070
those of you who may end up you know,
doing work within the kaiser system or

126
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,912
the BA system may find yourself giving
SBAR's and taking SBAR's.

127
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:44,251
And that's really a quick way to actually
communicate core information,

128
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,790
especially if you're dealing with an
emergent situation.

129
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,316
CUS, no we're not talking about bad
language,

130
00:09:51,316 --> 00:09:56,476
we're actually talking about the concept
of using signal words,

131
00:09:56,476 --> 00:10:03,560
such as danger, warning, caution that
might be common in the medical arena.

132
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,480
Basically, whenever these words are
spoken, the idea is that all

133
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,960
the team members, would understand clearly
not only what the issue is, but

134
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,700
also what the magnitude of the issue on
hand.

135
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,208
So, typically CUS is actually used where
you have a situation where, you know,

136
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:25,663
you may have a little conflict between you
and the team member, or

137
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:30,950
your lead attending or your chief
residents or whoever that's involved.

138
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,002
You know, maybe heading in a direction,
and

139
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:35,940
you have a slight disagreement, well
what's going on.

140
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,791
And so this is a bit of a challenging,
methodology to kind of challenge

141
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:47,240
the situation on hand or what the state of
mind is on hand with some key information.

142
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,276
CUS stands for,

143
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:54,210
you need to state your concern, you know,
what is going on from your standpoint.

144
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,020
Hey team members, based on my impression,
you know,

145
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,320
I believe this patient may be manifesting
signs of Septicemia.

146
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,352
Sure, the patient's lactate you know,
isn't over 4.0, but

147
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:10,248
the fact of the matter is, is that patient
is showing all the signs and symptoms of

148
00:11:10,248 --> 00:11:14,770
the fever without showing the lab signs or
symptoms, so I have a concern.

149
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,250
The second part of it, you know,
especially if the issue is not addressed,

150
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,240
and you know, that you know, this could be
leading down the path for

151
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,250
that patient that is very undesirable, you
need to

152
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,440
state the reason why you are uncomfortable
well, whatever the situation is.

153
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,230
So first you state your concern, then you
state why you are uncomfortable.

154
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,750
It could be everything from in my previous
experience.

155
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,287
I've seen, you know, this kind of case
before and

156
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:44,876
you know, I think we may be barking up the
wrong tree.

157
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:48,257
War based on what I have evaluated, based
on my analysis,

158
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:51,570
no I don't think we're heading in the
right direction.

159
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,480
And then finally, if no action is taken
after you've stated your concern, or

160
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,450
state why you're uncomfortable, if this
issue isn't resolved then you may want to

161
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,619
state that there is a safety issue.

162
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:11,500
Or you have a safety a patient's safety
factor going on here,

163
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,220
that needs to be addressed.

164
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,464
So, CUS is really used as a methodology,
especially in a, situation where there

165
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:23,000
may be a little difference of opinion
about what's going on.

166
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,480
And that because the crisis situation, the
key member or

167
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,720
the lead person in charge of the case, may
not be recognizing all of the information.

168
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,938
And you, as a party to the activity, or
maybe in a, as an observer,

169
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:40,526
you may want to consider using the CUS
methodology to be able to state your,

170
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,480
you know, state your point.

171
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,068
State your concern, then state why your
uncomfortable, and

172
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:49,725
if it's not resolved, state that there is
a safety issue, and

173
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:53,710
it may require escalation to get
additional help.

174
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,800
So, CUS is not a bad thing, but

175
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,420
it's actually a good methodology to be
able to address the issue.

176
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,040
And, once again, if the issue hasn't been
addressed through this CUS methodology,

177
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,070
you may need to be able to call for
assistant or escalate for

178
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:14,320
additional help or raise it to your next
level you know, attending or

179
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,070
whoever in order to try to get the patient
taken care of.

180
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,030
So, remember the whole intent behind CUS
is.

181
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:27,150
Just not to have a, situation where you're
having a battle between the team members,

182
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,040
but is to be able to state a point about
any issue,

183
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,280
that you have concerns about, to be able
to do the right thing for your patient.

184
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,120
Conflict resolution is a big issue of what
we deal with among team members, and

185
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,690
many times people don't feel comfortable
with raising those issues.

186
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,954
Especially if they have been beaten down a
couple times whenever a situation

187
00:13:46,954 --> 00:13:47,890
present itself.

188
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:53,272
So that leads us to another acronym DESC.

189
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:57,160
And DESC is a methodology that you may
want to

190
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,730
consider if the conflict becomes potential
low personal.

191
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:09,358
DESC can be used in more conflicting
scenarios when which reasonable behaviors

192
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:14,818
are practiced, hostile, and harassment
type of behavior is ongoing,

193
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:20,700
and ultimately patient safety, or a safe
patient care is suffering.

194
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,600
So what is the acronym stand for?

195
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,320
Well it starts with a D, and you probably
don't want to do this in heat of

196
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,760
a critical situation, this is probably
best reserved for, after the event is,

197
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,820
is, has occur, or the situation has been
managed, or its desecrating.

198
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,270
To be able to have a one on one
conversation, with whoever it

199
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:46,820
was that you were having this conflict
with, and it starts off with.

200
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,740
Hey, you know, can I speak to you about a
couple things,

201
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,270
about that case we were dealing with?

202
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,146
So you want to set aside, a little time,
make it clear to

203
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:03,390
who you're working with that you need to
have a, you know, a little bit of quiet,

204
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:08,240
a one-on-one conversation about, you know,
what had just occurred.

205
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,460
You want to start off with describing, the
spe, specific situation.

206
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,850
Hey, I want to talk to you about how that
case went, do you have a minute?

207
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,750
Oh, sure, great, let's get together and,
and go get something to eat, or

208
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,930
get something to drink, and you can tell
me what's on your mind.

209
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,622
Well, once you get something to eat or
drink, or you're in a room, he says, you

210
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:36,650
know, I wasn't, I wasn't quite comfortable
in terms of how that case was handled.

211
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,610
Well, what, what's up, what, you know,
what are you talking about?

212
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,233
Realistically you, you know, when you
stepped in, you started barking out

213
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:50,722
instruction, you could get a sense that
the dynamics of the team changed,

214
00:15:50,722 --> 00:15:55,144
some the team members not familiar with
how you approach things locked up, and

215
00:15:55,144 --> 00:15:58,400
you were yelling at them even more to do
more things.

216
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,864
You know I'm really kind of concerned
about the way that our communication is

217
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:06,410
going on that we don't get everyone on the
same page.

218
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:11,500
So E stands for expressing your concern
about whatever the action was.

219
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,288
S suggesting other alternatives, and this
is really hard because some people are not

220
00:16:16,288 --> 00:16:20,320
ready to even talk about these things or
if you don't even see a pattern or you

221
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,580
don't even see, an issue with how their
behavior was in that particular situation.

222
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,926
They may not be open to any feedback, but

223
00:16:27,926 --> 00:16:31,859
you need to at least try to provide a
little feedback so maybe they can

224
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:36,760
change their behavior the next time an
event like that was to occur again.

225
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,700
So, this means suggesting some other
alternative, whether it's, like,

226
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,600
hey, you know, just to let you know,
people were kind of shocked in

227
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,904
terms of how you're yelling and screaming
things at people.

228
00:16:47,904 --> 00:16:52,661
I think people might feel a little better
if you were just, give them a pointer or

229
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:57,616
two, about what needs to be done, or
shorten the request a little bit.

230
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:01,686
You ask that one staff person probably 12
things in a matter of,

231
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:06,570
like, 30 nanoseconds, and it probably
would help that person out is that,

232
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:11,730
you know, you gave them one or two things
at a time so that they understand.

233
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,526
What needs to be done and they can carry
all those actions out,

234
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:20,230
rather than hitting what 20 or 30 things
in a very short period of time.

235
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,694
C, consequences which should be stated and
this is a tough one because in many cases,

236
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:28,950
you know, you don't necessarily know what
consequences can be stated.

237
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,960
But, certainly hostile and harassing
behavior,

238
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,370
which is counterproductive to most teams,
can lead to additional types of

239
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:41,238
things that can adversely affect patient
care down the road.

240
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:46,278
Consequences may include, you know, hey, I
need to report this out to the chief of

241
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:50,382
staff, or I may have to report this out to
the the attending, or

242
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:54,368
I may have to call this out if this
doesn't change.

243
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:57,517
Usually most of us know, there are certain
patterns and

244
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:59,970
trends with people's behavior.

245
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,002
And, you know, departments like the
quality patient safety department or

246
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:08,286
your guest services department often times
get complaints about individuals,

247
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:12,600
in terms of how they communicate or how
they act with, you know, patients.

248
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,710
And when those things are looked at in
aggregate,

249
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:20,996
like many institution now have programs
that looks at professional behavior.

250
00:18:20,996 --> 00:18:26,116
or, appropriate care, you know, many, or,
many organizations are actually collecting

251
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:30,532
data to see if there's patterns and trends
with, you know, the care providers,

252
00:18:30,532 --> 00:18:35,060
whether it's a doctor, a resident, a
fellow nurse, a pharmacist, anybody.

253
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,940
You know, they're actually looking at that
kind of

254
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,920
data to see if there's pattern and trend.

255
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,614
It's pretty well known that when you have
problems with folks, feeling intimidated,

256
00:18:44,614 --> 00:18:49,286
or threatened, or have had previous bad
experience, are not inclined on,

257
00:18:49,286 --> 00:18:54,542
you know, engaging in a situation just
because, they don't want to go through,

258
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:57,560
that kind of a hassle in the next time
around.

259
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,940
So, people avoid raising those issue or

260
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,280
challenging, you know, the individual,
even though they may have core

261
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,840
information relevant to preventing that
event from having a bad outcome.

262
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:13,635
We mentioned this earlier in our program,
that, you know,

263
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:16,190
there are probably 40 plus wrong site,

264
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,860
wrong site wrong procedures wrong patient
procedures done across the country.

265
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,824
It's interesting that, you know, there's
been literature has shown that there's

266
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:31,720
been at least one person in that room that
actually was aware of what was going on,

267
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,596
but because the culture of that setting,
did not elect to speak up,

268
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:38,040
to prevent the bad thing from happening.

269
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,419
