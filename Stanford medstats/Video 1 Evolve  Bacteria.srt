00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,420
Hi, my name is Sharon Chen, and I'm from
Stanford University.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,200
And in this video, we're going to be
talking about basics of bacterial

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,120
structure and function which is part of
our Introduction to Microbiology module.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,850
The learning objectives are to describe
the key structural and

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,720
functional features unique to bacteria.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,186
To explain how horizontal gene transfer
relates to virulence, and

7
00:00:29,186 --> 00:00:30,900
antimicrobial resistance.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,440
To explain how the bacterial cell wall is
involved in identification and

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,560
classification of bacteria and as a target
for antibiotics, to understand the role of

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,390
pathogen associated molecular patterns and
infection.

11
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,090
And to visualize the major groups of
bacteria that cause disease.

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,170
Bacteria are the oldest and smallest life
form, if we look at the tree of life.

13
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,780
They are the first life form to branch out
from our most ancient common ancestor.

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,110
This means that they arose over 1 and a
half billion years.

15
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,420
Before even the simplest single cell,
eukaryotic cells,

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,900
that we call protozoa, began populating
the earth.

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,335
It took animals another billion years to
appear.

18
00:01:12,335 --> 00:01:16,245
Thus the bacteria have been evolving
sophisticated strategies to survive,

19
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:20,640
colonize, and infect us for much longer
than we have existed.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,560
Bacteria are also the smallest living
forms,

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,770
about ten times smaller than a single cell
in our body.

22
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,500
And they colonize almost every available
niche,

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,990
from our skin to all of our internal
mucosal surfaces.

24
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,350
In some ways, we are walking planets since
about 1 trillion bacteria live on

25
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,330
the surface of our skin alone.

26
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,370
There are more bacteria living on our
bodies than the number of

27
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,340
cells that make our tissues.

28
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,560
And many will accompany us, from the day
we are born, to our deathbed.

29
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,870
In fact, most interactions between our
bodies and

30
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,520
bacteria may be beneficial and do not
result in disease.

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,670
The bacteria living on us are much more
diverse than the subset that

32
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,970
cause disease.

33
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,290
This is called the microbiome.

34
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,320
In fact, we can't even culture a great
number of them.

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,980
And most of what we know comes from
analyzing their genomes.

36
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,820
We're learning that the bacteria living on
our external and

37
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,340
internal surfaces have important roles in
our physiology.

38
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,320
For example, in the intestine, they help
us digest nutrients, produce vitamins and

39
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,940
teach our immune system.

40
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,240
By simply being there,

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,170
they also protect us from pathogens that
could take over or invade.

42
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,910
In this course we will speak mainly about
the pathogenic bacteria.

43
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,770
Those that cause diseases in humans.

44
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,760
Let's start with a very basic description
of their structure and

45
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,510
then discuss some features that are more
specifically involved in disease.

46
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,300
Bacteria are relatively simple small bags
of cytosol surrounded by a membrane and

47
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,400
other layers of a tough envelope.

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,669
If we start from the inside, we'll find
cytosol rich in macro molecules,

49
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:55,570
including DNA, RNA, and proteins, but with
no internal membranes or organelles.

50
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,007
There is no nucleus, but

51
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:02,710
similar to eukaryotes, the genome is
encoded by double stranded DNA.

52
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,680
Usually, there is a single circular
chromosome that is

53
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,949
tightly coiled to fit in a very tiny
volume.

54
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,460
In addition to the chromosome,

55
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,880
some bacteria have extra chromosomal
genetic elements called plasmids,

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,830
which are smaller, usually circular
molecules of DNA.

57
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,990
Plasmids often carry genes that are not
essential for general bacterial survival.

58
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,530
But that can encode properties such as
antibiotic resistance.

59
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,390
Horizontal gene transfer is the exchange
of genetic information between bacteria.

60
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,170
This is different from inheritance which
is transfer of

61
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,295
information from one generation to
another.

62
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:41,250
[BLANK_AUDIO]

63
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,460
Horizontal gene transfer is a way to
quickly share genetic information even

64
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,980
between bacteria of different families.

65
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,170
In infectious diseases,

66
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,930
this is particularly important because
both pathogenic traits as well as

67
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,370
antibiotic resistance can be transferred
in this way making evolution much faster.

68
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,610
In this picture, we also

69
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:08,350
highlighted the bacterial ribosomes which
are factories for protein production.

70
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,750
Bacterial ribosomes are different enough
from our eukaryotic ribosomes that they

71
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,030
are good targets for antibiotics.

72
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,390
This is a short list of common antibiotics
that effect each of the two subunits of

73
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,850
the bacterial ribosomes and interfere with
protein synthesis.

74
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,350
The cytosol is packaged and held together
by several layers of the envelope.

75
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,618
A simple lipid bilayer called a cell
membrane, as seen here in green,

76
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:41,543
with transmembrane proteins within it.

77
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:46,644
Surrounding the cell membrane is the cell
wall made of peptidoglycan.

78
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:52,463
The peptidoglycan cell wall is a structure
unique to bacteria.

79
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:55,122
The peptidoglycan cell wall is a flexible,
but

80
00:04:55,122 --> 00:04:58,490
strong molecular mesh made of a single
molecule.

81
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,920
It consist of parallel strands of
repeating disaccharides,

82
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,420
that means two sugars and cross length to
each other by short peptide chains.

83
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,770
The wall is important for maintaining and
determine the shape of the bacteria.

84
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,610
And protects the bacteria from osmotic
pressure.

85
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,262
It needs to be constantly modified and

86
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:20,162
assembled to accommodate growth and
division.

87
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:22,590
And thus a very important second target
for

88
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,040
antimicrobials, called cell wall agents.

89
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,420
The cell wall and cell membrane together
are called the cell envelope.

90
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,935
One group of bacteria have a cell membrane
surrounded by a thick cell wall.

91
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:42,100
[BLANK_AUDIO]

92
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,640
A second group of bacteria evolved a
second membrane or

93
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,910
outer membrane that surrounds a thin cell
wall.

94
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,380
These two groups can be distinguished by a
very common microbiological stain used in

95
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,340
the clinic called the Gram-stain.

96
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,060
The structure of the envelope determines
the difference in the staining.

97
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,800
Here's an example of the stain.

98
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:10,620
Gram-positive bacteria have thick cell
walls that stain strongly and

99
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,210
retain the purplish stain.

100
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,240
While gram-negative bacteria stain poorly
and remain pink.

101
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,200
The outer cell membrane of gram-negative
bacteria is a barrier that

102
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,510
allows further control of diffusion of
substances in and out of the bacteria.

103
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,570
This makes them naturally resistant to
antibiotics that cannot penetrate

104
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,780
the outer membrane.

105
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,040
It also makes them resistant to enzymes
that degrade the cell wall,

106
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,580
like lysisime in our tears and saliva.

107
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,030
There are many important modifications of
the cell wall and

108
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,390
the outer cell membrane that change the
properties of the envelope.

109
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,900
One that is very important in medicine is
on the outer leaflet

110
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,140
of the outer membrane.

111
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,720
These are special lipids cross-linked to
sugar chains called

112
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,730
Lipopolysaccharides or LPS.

113
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,040
LPS is important for

114
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,860
the structural integrity of the outer
membrane and its permeability.

115
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,360
It is also an extremely potent signaling
molecule.

116
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,100
When LPS is released from dying bacteria,

117
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,750
it can be sensed by our innate immune
system in the blood stream.

118
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,020
The response can be so

119
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,438
dramatic that it acts like a toxin and can
cause shock and even death.

120
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:24,500
In fact, it's also known as endotoxin,

121
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,380
as opposed to toxins that are secreted by
that bacteria, exotoxins.

122
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,830
The response to LPS is an example of our
body's ability to

123
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,680
detect specific molecules from bacterial
pathogens and even from commensals.

124
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,500
We call these Pathogen-Associated
Molecular Patterns, or PAMPs.

125
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,540
Other optional structures in the bacteria
envelope can be quite important in

126
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,920
colonizing us, or in causing disease.

127
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,500
For example, many bacteria swim, propelled
by rotating flagella,

128
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,440
which is a tubular polymer anchored to an
nano motor that spins the flagella.

129
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,430
The envelope may be covered with other
structures, like fimbriae or

130
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,550
pili, long polymers with a molecular hook
at the end,

131
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,950
that allow the bacteria to attach to the
cell surface, or to each other.

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,050
Several types of molecular syringes,

133
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,490
known as secretion systems may be embedded
in the envelope.

134
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,290
These can secrete or transfer molecules
from the bacteria to the host cells.

135
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,190
Finally, a conspicuous external addition
to the envelope is a mucoid substance made

136
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,170
of sugars, polysaccharides, called the
capsule.

137
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,150
It can help bacteria either avoid being
seen by our immune systems,

138
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,500
by hiding their surface structures,
prevent them from drying out, or

139
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,370
make them difficult to phagocytose by our
white blood cells.

140
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,590
There are many specialized molecules that
are involved in disease, and

141
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:50,100
are usually not essential to the survival
of the bacteria.

142
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,380
We often call these bacterial products
virulence factors,

143
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,900
because they enhance the ability of
bacteria to cause disease.

144
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,980
One example of a specific virulence factor
is a protein that

145
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,520
the vibrio cholera produce to induce
massive, watery diarrhea.

146
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,420
This is an example of a virulence factor
that can quickly lead to dehydration

147
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,590
because of the action of a single molecule
with a powerful biological effect.

148
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,790
Many virulence factors are shared through
horizontal gene transfer.

149
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,550
As we explore the many fascinating
microbes that cause disease in humans,

150
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,490
think about these adaptations and

151
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,190
which virulence factors are involved in
the diseases you learn about.

152
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,180
We will end with a short list of the
bacteria that cause disease in humans and

153
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,240
will be mentioned in the course.

154
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,160
This list organizes the bacteria in a
clinical way that would help you

155
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,761
come back and place the microbes in
context.
