1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,520
In this next module I'm going to review
probability distributions.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,640
If you're totally comfortable with the
concepts of probability density function

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,460
and cumulative distribution function, then
you can skip this module.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,600
However, if you need a little refresher
then,

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,690
you should watch this module [SOUND].

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,780
So, first of all, what's a probability
function?

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,590
A probability function is just a
mathematical function that happens to

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,970
integrate to one.

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,950
So, here's one example.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,730
This is an exponential function.

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,280
And without me even kind of proving it
mathematically to you,

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,710
you can kind of believe that indeed the
area under the curve of

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,280
an exponential function [SOUND] might
indeed be equal to one.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,860
You can see it's kind of coming down
towards the x-axis which limits its value.

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,990
Another probability function is the
uniform distribution which

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,990
just ranges from zero to one and has
probability of one everywhere.

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,020
That's another example of a probability
function.

18
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,540
You don't have to be able integrate
anything to see that the area under that

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,910
curve is one.

20
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,140
Just for fun.

21
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,950
To show you, since we're going to be
talking somewhat about

22
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,540
the exponential distribution in this
class.

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,650
The ex, the formula for an exponential
distribution is the following,

24
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,420
where [SOUND] h is just a constant number.

25
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,960
And if you use different values for

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,950
h, that's going to change the exact shape
of the exponential.

27
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,140
Some exponentials are more steep than
others and

28
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,550
some are more shallow than others.

29
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,390
And that just depends on what you plug in
there for h [SOUND].

30
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,090
Regardless of what you plug in for h,
however that curve will

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,480
integrate to one and I'll show you that
just in a second here.

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,010
I just want to note that I am using t
rather than x as my x axis variable here.

33
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,340
And the reason I'm doing that is because
why we're talking about

34
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,270
probability distributions.

35
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,150
I that we're gong to be trying to say, do
my times two event,

36
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,970
happened t follow a known probability
distribution.

37
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,800
It could be the case that in my study, the
times to death, or the times to pregnancy,

38
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,010
or the times to depression, or whatever my
outcomes is, it could be that those

39
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,600
times actually follow something like an
exponential distribution.

40
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,390
Function.

41
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,040
If you can pin that down then that's
obviously you

42
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,190
can fit those data to a pretty nice,
smooth mathematical model.

43
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,740
So I'm just going to be using t rather
than x to start with here since

44
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,300
eventually we're just going to be talking
about probability distributions for

45
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,980
the, survival times.

46
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,060
So this is an exponential function I've
written out here.

47
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,560
You do not have to do any intervals in
this Course, but just totally for

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,560
fun, I'm going to integrate this curve
from zero to infinity.

49
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,610
It starts at zero, there's no negatives
here on an exponential.

50
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,840
From 0 to infinity, if I integrate this
curve,

51
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,470
I can show you indeed that the area under
the curve is one.

52
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,450
If you totally hate integrals and

53
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,070
you don't want to see this, feel free to
forward the video.

54
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,992
But just for fun, here's my function.

55
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:56,370
[SOUND] And it's an easy function to
integrate actually because the exponential

56
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,530
the derivative of the exponential is just
the exponential.

57
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,740
It's a little more complicated because we
have to do chain rule since we

58
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,460
have our key.

59
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,420
Our variable has been multiplied by a
negative h.

60
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,140
So a negative will come down.

61
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,710
They each will cancel.

62
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,330
And we're left with that the interval here
is negative e raised to negative ht.

63
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,920
We then evaluated it at zero and in,
infinity and so

64
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,950
if I plug in infinity while negative e
raised to negative infinity anything

65
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,060
raised to negative infinity is going to
zero [SOUND].

66
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,110
And then I do minus.

67
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,150
This negative e raised to negative ht.

68
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,970
I'm going to plug in zero now.

69
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,490
And, well, of course, e raised to zero
just goes to one,

70
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,140
so I've got a minus minus one.

71
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,296
That's going to here, have an area under
the curve of one.

72
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,230
I won't integrate the, uniform
distribution is pretty obvious that

73
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,470
the area under that curve is one since
it's just a box with sides one [SOUND].

74
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,000
We can talk about the probability density
function.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,976
That's just the formula, for

76
00:03:56,976 --> 00:04:02,130
example, I just gave you f of t is equal
[SOUND] to h e raised to negative h t.

77
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,320
That's that function there.

78
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,850
That's just the original Function and what
it [SOUND] gives me is it gives me

79
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:13,840
the probability of say death occurring at
any particular time point.

80
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,580
So before you know anything about anybody
in this study before this study starts.

81
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,490
If you think that times are going to
follow a particular distribution like

82
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,570
an exponential, you might say: Well what's
the probability that

83
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,560
somebody's going to die at exactly 2.2
years into the study.

84
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,090
Or what's the probability that somebody's
[SOUND] going to die at exactly 3.2 years.

85
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,500
And this turns out to be not particularly
useful because, in fact, since we're

86
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,350
dealing with continuous numbers here,
there is no such thing as exactly 2.2.

87
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,110
Right?

88
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,842
It could be 2.2013.

89
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:44,600
We have to go way out to the decimal
places.

90
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,190
So what we really need to talk about with
continuous probability function is

91
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,790
ranges of values.

92
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,560
But the density function just defines this
curve then what we end up

93
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,740
talking about in, in reality here is the
cumulative distribution function because

94
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,490
what we want to know is about eerie is
under this curve.

95
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,610
What is the chance that somebody dies
between your two and

96
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,370
your three for example.

97
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,530
So the probability density function
defines that curve, but

98
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,170
then what we're really want is to get the
cumulative distribution function which

99
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,690
tells us about ranges of values.

100
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,750
So for example [SOUND], I could say what's
the chance that somebody dies with.

101
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,330
In the first 2.2 years of the study.

102
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,560
That's something I can actually calculate
a probably for that makes sense.

103
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,150
The convention for

104
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,710
cumulative distribution functions is that
we always do areas to the left.

105
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,680
So we're always doing what's the
probability that

106
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,220
a person dies before a particular time T.

107
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,536
Before two point two for example we are
always doing areas to the left [SOUND].

108
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,160
And you don't need be able to do any
integrals here again but just for fun I'll

109
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,700
show you we can get a general equation
Equation that will give us the area under

110
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,460
the curve for any time T, whether it be
2.2 or 3.2, or whatever it might be.

111
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,830
So of course all we'd do to get that is we
can do an integral here.

112
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,070
So we will be integrating now from zero to
T.

113
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,860
The integral is the same as before
[SOUND].

114
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,120
So if I take this interval it's just
negative e raised to negative ht.

115
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,610
But now I'm evaluating it from t, to, from
zero to t.

116
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:23,020
So any time T that I want to plug in to
get the cumulative probabilities I

117
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,510
can plug in T here, so negative e raised
to negative hT [SOUND] is the first part,

118
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,410
and then we're going to do minus, a minus
e raised to negative h times zero.

119
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,740
Well, that's of course going to go to one.

120
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,616
So we rearrange this, this is a negative
negative one, minus minus one, so

121
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:42,710
that becomes positive one minus e raised
to negative hT [SOUND].

122
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,900
So this is a general formula for

123
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,990
the CDF [SOUND], the cumulative
distribution function, of the exponential.

124
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,132
That's a particular example.

125
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:54,930
Again [SOUND], don't worry about doing the
interval, intervals.

126
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,240
And that's a cumulative distribution
function for an exponential.

127
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,970
We're going to see this equation require a
little bit later.

128
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,470
Now, when we're doing survival analysis,
we're often actually more interested

129
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,710
not in the probability of a particular
event occurring by a particular time.

130
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,590
We're usually interested in, what's the
chance that you survive past that time?

131
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,880
So we're usually more interested in the
right hand area rather than

132
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,470
the left hand area.

133
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:18,970
Area.

134
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,690
Well that's very easy to get if we have
the left hand area,

135
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,830
we just do one minus the CDF to get the
right hand area.

136
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,535
So in other words, in survival analyses we
often talk about what's

137
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:33,430
the probability [SOUND] of surviving past
say, time 2.2, what's this area.

138
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,120
Well that's easy to get, it's just
going to be one minus the CDF [SOUND].

139
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,510
In that so we call this the survival
probability, so

140
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:44,510
the probability [SOUND] of surviving past
a particular time T, that's one minus CDF,

141
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,180
which in this case is one minus one minus
e raised to the negative hT.

142
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,710
So that is going to be

143
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,690
the ones will cancel we end up with
positive e raised to negative hT.

144
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,580
And you would just pug in a value for

145
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,810
t to say what's the probability of
surviving past a particular time t?

146
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,020
Again, don't worry about deriving that
formula,

147
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,000
that's a formula that will reoccur in an
upcoming module.

148
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,540
Just briefly, I want to just throw in one
additional concept here,

149
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,460
because this is something we're going to
talk about a lot in.

150
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:19,380
In the next module, but this is directly
related to the probability density and

151
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,150
cumulative density functions.

152
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,610
Something called a hazard function, and
all a hazard function is, is it says.

153
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,590
Imagine that you know that a person has
survived up

154
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,930
until exactly the time 2.2 years into the
study [SOUND].

155
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,540
If you know they've survived up that far,
so it's conditioned on them

156
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,870
surviving that long, what's the
probability that they're going to die or

157
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,410
have the event in the exact next instant,
it's an instantaneous incidents rate.

158
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,610
That's what we mean by the hazard
function.

159
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,580
It's the probably of dying right dead.

160
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,680
Conditioned on the fact that you've
survived up until this point.

161
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:01,245
And so the hazard [SOUND] function is
equal to the density function.

divide by that, what's the chances that
you will die in the absolute next instant?

165
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,070
So again, I just want you to understand

that's a concept that we're now gong to go
