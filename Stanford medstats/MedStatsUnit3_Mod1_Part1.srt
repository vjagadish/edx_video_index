1
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,180
In this next module, I'm going to show you
how to calculate some basic probability.

2
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,720
So first of all, what is probability?

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,795
So, probability is the chance that an
uncertain event will occur.

4
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:23,960
And it's always a number between 0 and 1.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,390
You can't have anything lower than a 0%
chance,

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,530
you can't have anything higher than a 100%
chance.

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,170
I am going to be using a few symbols this
week.

8
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,860
They're really just a shorthand to make it
faster to write things.

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,070
So, let me just review these symbols now.

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,130
So, when I want to write the probability
of something happening,

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,360
like the probability that event A will
occur.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,220
I'm going to shorthand that by writing a
P, and

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,260
then I'm going to write a parenthesis.

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,140
And put in the parenthesis whatever I want
to know the probability of.

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,040
So, like P(A), you would read that as the
probability that event A will occur.

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,945
And again, this is just a shorthand.

17
00:00:56,945 --> 00:00:58,460
It just makes it faster for

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,600
me to write these things down and do some
calculations.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,030
An example would be if I put P (red card),
I would be asking for

20
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,720
the probability of a red card.

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,810
Say when you're pulling cards out of a
deck,

22
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,778
what's the probability of getting a red
card.

23
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:18,710
I'm going to use the little symbol tilde
to represent not,

24
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,730
the probability of something not
happening.

25
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,530
We also will sometimes call this the
complement.

26
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,760
So, if I put probability P tilde A,

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,910
that's the probability of not getting a
event event A.

28
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,850
And here's an example.

29
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,870
Like if I put P tilde red A card, that's
the probability of not getting a red card.

30
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,030
Again, it's just a short hand.

31
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,840
Also show you what are called some joint
probabilities,

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,250
like the probability of A and the B.

33
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,410
That's the probability that both things
will occur together.

34
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,620
So, this will be something like the
probability of getting a red

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,460
card and an ace.

36
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,520
In other words, the probability of getting
a red ace,

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,390
both of those things happening at the same
time.

38
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,400
That's called the joint probability, and I
represent that with an ampersand.

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,780
So, let's do a couple of examples.

40
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,780
So, let's say you draw one card from a
standard deck of cards.

41
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,600
Let's say that the deck of cards doesn't
have any jokers.

42
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,240
For all the problems this week you can
assume that there's no jokers involved,

43
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,480
just a standard deck of 52 cards.

44
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,910
What's the probability that you draw an
ace?

45
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,065
So, how would you solve that?

46
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:23,920
So, you have to think about the way cards
work.

47
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,380
So if you've got a standard deck, there's
52 cards.

48
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,150
There are four aces in a deck, so

49
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,220
the probability that you would draw an ace
would be 4 out of 52.

50
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,470
You then, the denominator is the total
number of cards.

51
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,620
There's 4 that are aces, so 4 out of 52,
that's probably about 7.7%.

52
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,280
Again, I've used the P parenthesis to
shorthand the probability of

53
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,820
drawing an ace.

54
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,490
Let's do a few more examples.

55
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,890
So, let's say that event A is drawing a
red card and event B is drawing an ace.

56
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,980
So what is, for

57
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,820
example, the probability of A, what's the
probability of drawing a red card?

58
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,130
So, if I have a standard deck of cards
with 52 cards,

59
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,310
half of the cards are red and half are
black.

60
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,620
So, there's 26 red cards out of a total of
52 cards.

61
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,687
So, the probability of A, the probability
of drawing a red card, would be 1 half, or

62
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:18,740
26 out of 52.

63
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,330
What's the probability of drawing an ace?

64
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,713
Well, we just actually calculated that.

65
00:03:23,713 --> 00:03:26,550
That's 4 out of 52.

66
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,240
And we can simplify that down to 1 out of
13.

67
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,313
One out of 13 cards in a deck is an ace.

68
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:40,195
What's the probability of not drawing a
red card?

69
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:42,951
So, the probability of not drawing of
drawing a red card would be

70
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:44,965
the probability of drawing a black card,
right?

71
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:46,820
So, there's 26 black cards in the deck.

72
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,800
In other words, half of the deck is black
cards.

73
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,300
So, the probability of not getting a red
card is also 1 half.

74
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,930
What's the probability of not drawing an
ace?

75
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,400
So, for this one, there's a couple of
different ways to solve it,

76
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,120
but here's the easiest way to solve it.

77
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,590
We've already calculated the probability
of drawing an ace.

78
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,820
The probability of not drawing an ace is
going to be 1 minus the probability of

79
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,670
drawing an ace.

80
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,290
In other words, you either draw an ace or
you don't draw an ace.

81
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,340
The probability of drawing an ace is 1 out
of 13.

82
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,381
And the probability of not drawing an ace
is 12 out of 13.

83
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:25,250
There's a little rule embedded in here,
which I'm just going to write out.

84
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:32,910
The probability of A happening or A not
happening has to be equal to 1, right?

85
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,130
Because either A happens or it doesn't
happen.

86
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,930
One of those things has to happen, so the
sum of their probabilities has to equal 1.

87
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,100
So, I've used that little rule to solve
for

88
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,520
the probability of not drawing an ace
here.

89
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,110
Finally, what's the probability of getting
a red ace?

90
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,240
Of both getting a red card and an ace
card?

91
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,550
So, what's the joint probability?

92
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,860
What's the probability of getting a red
ace?

93
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,490
Well again, we have 52 cards in the deck.

94
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,960
How many red aces are there?

95
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,380
Well, there's the, the ace of diamonds and
the ace of hearts, so there's two.

96
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,900
So, that probability is 2 out of 52.

97
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,540
Now notice, with a lot of probability
problems,

98
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,570
all we're doing to solve them is just
reasoning things out.

99
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,710
That's a lot of why probability is hard
because it's a lot of just thinking

100
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,070
things out.

101
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,480
All the probability problems you can think
of, there are.

102
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,630
All the sorts of different probability
problems have different ways of

103
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,400
getting at the answer.

104
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,920
And that's what makes it really
challenging.

105
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,200
There isn't one formula I can give you
that works for all probability problems.

106
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,550
You really just have to think.

107
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,110
That's why I love probability problems,
too.

108
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,750
So, this slide just summarizes the answers
I had on the last slide.

109
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,460
Again, there's a rule that the probability
of A plus the probability of

110
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,710
not A always has to sum up to 1.

111
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,280
One of those things has to happen.

112
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,340
Either A happens or A doesn't happen.

113
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,190
Those two probabilities have to sum up to
1.

114
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,670
You can use that rule as we're going to
see later this week.

115
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,630
That's a very helpful rule in calculating
probability.

116
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,890
I just want to mention a little bit of
philosophical here.

117
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:03,620
The type of probability that I'm talking
about this week,

118
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,650
we're taking what's called a Frequentist
View of Probability.

119
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,660
So, you can think of probability as the
frequency with which

120
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,080
an event occurs over the long run.

121
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,800
So if I keep playing many, many hands of
cards.

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,640
Eventually, over many, many times of
drawing cards out of a deck.

123
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,300
It would be the case that I would be
getting 1 in 13 times I'd

124
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,070
be drawing an ace, for example.

125
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,260
That's conceptually how we're viewing
probability.

126
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,439
This is the, this is not the only way to
view probability.

127
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,730
But, this is conceptually how we're
viewing it this week and

128
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,738
for a lot of this course.

129
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:38,790
The frequency with which an event occurs,
over the long run.

130
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,810
When we talk about what's a P value and we
talk about statistical inference.

131
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,260
I'm going to be saying a lot of if you
could repeat this experiment over and

132
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,810
over again.

133
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,790
This is the same view of how,

134
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,930
how frequent do you expect something to
occur over the long run.

135
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,320
So, just tuck that in the back of your
head,

136
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,502
that that's kind of the basis of a lot of
the calculations we're doing this week.

137
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:59,908
I want to make one little distinction for
you.

138
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:01,900
because there are two types of
probabilities that we're going to

139
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,379
deal with in this course.

140
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:05,960
There are what are call Theoretical
Probabilities.

141
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,900
A lot of what we're going to

142
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,440
calculate this week are just theoretical
probabilities.

143
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,030
So, these are based on theory.

144
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,480
That as we understand how a deck of cards
works or

145
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,570
we understand how a die works, or better
understand how coins work.

146
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,520
By the way, because we're doing
probability this week,

147
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,130
there's going to be a a lot of dice, and
coins, and cards.

148
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,270
And that's simply because everybody
understands how those work.

149
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,530
They make good examples for calculating
probabilities.

150
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,920
So, those are theoretical probabilities
though, because I don't have to go out.

151
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,820
And collect data in order to be able to
tell you what the probability of

152
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,710
drawing an ace is, or the probability of
rolling a two on the die is.

153
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,450
I just know those from understanding how a
die works.

154
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,990
That's in contrast to what are called
Empirical Probabilities.

155
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,760
A lot of what we're going to deal with in
medicine are empirical probabilities.

156
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,980
We use the theoretical probabilities to,
to build up the theory of statistics.

157
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,500
But in fact, when we go out and

158
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,120
measure things, we're measuring empirical
probabilities.

159
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,152
These are based on data.

160
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:05,100
So for example, some geologists have
collected a bunch of

161
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,810
historical data about earthquakes in the
Bay area.

162
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,400
And using that data, they said that the
probability of

163
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,970
a major earthquake happening in the Bay
Area by 2032 is 62%.

164
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,380
Well, they didn't figure that out by
understanding how earthquakes work.

165
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,796
They figured that out based on some data.

166
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:27,330
Similarly, if you ask about say the
probability that somebody who

167
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,620
smokes over their lifetime will develop
lung cancer.

168
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,760
It's something like 15%.

169
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,740
We didn't arrive at that, but I understand
how smoking interacts with the lungs.

170
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,350
That's from looking at lots and lots of
people over time.

171
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:45,410
And seeing what percent of smokers
actually develop lung cancer, so

172
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,960
that's based again on empirical data.

173
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,560
So, we'll be doing some calculations of
probability from both empirical data and

174
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,040
just from a theoretical standpoint.

175
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,760
So, here's an example of probability using
empirical data.

176
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,700
So, here's some data on blood type.

177
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,450
Somebody nicely organized this chart so
that there is,

178
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,915
it's easy to read the chart.

179
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:07,970
So, if you have 100 donors,

180
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,310
somebody's figured out the prevalence of
different blood types in the population.

181
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,968
And out of 100 people, you'd expect 84 of
them to be RH positive and

182
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:18,740
16 to be RH negative.

183
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,340
And then within those, we get a breakdown
of type O,

184
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,310
versus Type A, versus Type B, versus Type
A and B.

185
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,260
And so, it's a very easy chart to read.

186
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,130
Because rather than giving percentages or
decimals, the person who put this chart

187
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:36,200
together made the denominator a nice even
hundred so it's easy to read this chart.

188
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,150
So, for example, what's the probability
that a random donor will be AB Positive?

189
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:45,130
Well, as we see in the chart, 3 out of 100
donors are AB positive, so

190
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,810
that answer will simply just be 3%.

191
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,260
You can see this is quite easy to
calculate when you set up the charts so

192
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,600
nicely like this.

193
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,580
What's the probability that a random donor
will have a blood type of O?

194
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,280
This one is just slightly harder to
calculate.

195
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,110
Because you have to recognize that there
are O positives and

196
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,123
there are O negatives, and we have to add
those up.

197
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:06,080
So, 38 O positives and 7 O negatives.

198
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,830
In other words, there are 45 people total
who have an O blood type.

199
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,120
So, out of a hundred, 45 out of 100.

200
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,000
That means that there's a 45% chance of
the donor having an O blood type.

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,380
So again, those are empirical data
probabilities.
