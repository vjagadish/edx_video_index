00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:18,265
>> Hey, Doctor Lemmons.

4
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:18,773
Yeah, know what?
I'm here in the ED.

5
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:23,040
They asked me to come down and evaluate a
patient.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,079
I'm with the neurosurgeon right now.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,580
All right, I'll give you a call when I
know more.

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,874
Okay, bye.

9
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:31,030
Hey, Kevin.

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,660
>> Hi.
>> So this is, this is Mr. Williams.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,792
We're coming down to evaluate him, because
a possible subdural hematoma.

12
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,400
>> Mm hm.
>> He just went to the CT scanner.

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,130
Looks like he does have a subdural
hematoma that may be expanding.

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,600
>> Okay.
>> From what I heard,

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,745
he's getting more abtunded.

16
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,076
>> Mm-hm.
>> He's not as responsive.

17
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:51,751
He has a history of hypertension,
depression, BPH, osteoarthritis, and

18
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:52,778
type-2 diabetes.

19
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:54,630
>> Mm hm.
>> Let's go evaluate.

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,130
>> Okay.

21
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,860
>> Hello, Mr. Williams.

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,170
>> Hi, hi.
>> And who are you?

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,186
>> Hi I'm his son.

24
00:01:02,186 --> 00:01:03,340
>> Okay.

25
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,090
>> It's nice to meet you, sir, I'm, I'm
Dr. Jenner.

26
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,835
>> Oh, hi, nice to meet you, finally.

27
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:08,656
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Chu.

28
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:10,020
>> Very nice to meet you.

29
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,060
>> Hi.

30
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,410
>> So, in looking at your father's CT
scan,

31
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,980
it looks like his he, he does have a bleed
inside of his brain and we,.

32
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,630
>> Oh, wow.

33
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,575
>> So, that [CROSSTALK].

34
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:22,552
>> Okay.
>> So we, we do need to do surgery.

35
00:01:22,552 --> 00:01:23,098
>> Okay.
>> In,

36
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:26,581
in talking to the emergency room doctor,
he did say that there was a do not

37
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:30,546
intubate order that your, that your father
had signed, though, in the past, and

38
00:01:30,546 --> 00:01:32,840
he saw that on his chart on the computer.

39
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,050
>> All right, he never told me about that.

40
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,180
So what, what does that mean?

41
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,050
>> That means, that means that we can't
intubate your father if he

42
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,350
doesn't want us to intubate him,

43
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,920
and put him on a ventilator like we need
to do for a surgical case like this.

44
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,670
>> But you can still take him to surgery?

45
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,990
>> No, we can't take him to surgery unless
we're able to do that

46
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,010
[MUSIC]

47
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,790
>> But he needs to have this repaired,
this, this bleed fixed.

48
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,470
>> He does, he definitely does.

49
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,025
So we're kind of in a, in a conundrum
here.

50
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,080
I, since he's not really talking with us
anymore and

51
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,770
he's, he's, he's not doing so well.

52
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,940
>> Oh, well, yeah.
>> We need to make a decision here.

53
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,700
What do you think we should do, Dr. Chu?

54
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,940
You know, if we don't intubate him and get
a breathing tube in in the next five or

55
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,350
10 minutes, we're looking at a very bad
situation.

56
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,050
Hopefully
>> Well, then let's do it.

57
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,290
>> Yeah, I can't, I can't find the
information on the computer.

58
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,400
>> Can we get the, can we get the DNA
paperwork.

59
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,660
>> I can't find it on the computer.

60
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,005
The computer system just went down.

61
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:23,810
>> Hm.
>> What do you think we should do?
