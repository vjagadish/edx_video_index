1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,300
In this next module, I'm going to talk
about mediating variables.

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,660
So a mediating variable, a mediator looks
a lot like a confounder.

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,400
Like a confounder it has to be associated,
both with the protector and

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,300
the outcome variables.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,120
Unlike a confounder however, it is on the
causal pathway between the predictor and

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,280
the outcome.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,830
So it helps to explain why a predictor and
an outcome are causally related.

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:37,420
So that's different than a confounder
because it's on the causal pathway.

9
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,690
I just want to point out though that
mediation and confounding, mediator

10
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,430
variables and confounding variables are
actually identical statistically.

11
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,640
The way that we're going to identify them,

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,640
what they do statistically is actually the
same.

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,190
So we're really only distinguishing these,
on conceptual grounds.

14
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,950
Statistically, they're going to look the
same, but because we know more information

15
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,830
about the problem, we know about the
biology or about the clinical problem.

16
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,760
We can make a judgment call as to whether
or

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,200
not one is a confounder versus a mediator.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,130
So for example in the case I gave in an
earlier module about lung cancer and

19
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:17,660
drinking and smoking, we decided that
smoking was a confounder.

20
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,420
Smoking is not on a causal pathway between
drinking and lung cancer, so

21
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,630
it's not the case that if you drink, that
causes you to smoke more.

22
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,680
And that's, then smoking increases your
risk of lung cancer.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,900
So there's no causal relationship between
drinking and smoking.

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,430
Smoking just happens to be related to both
of them,

25
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,240
there's in fact no causal relationship
between drinking and

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,510
lung cancer, the relationship we're seeing
is purely driven by smoking.

27
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,480
So that would be an example of a
confounder.

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,590
An example of a mediator would be if you
look at the relationship between

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,270
obesity and heart disease, and you look at
the mediating variable of blood pressure.

30
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,540
So obesity probably is causatively related
to heart disease.

31
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,060
Disease and then the variable blood
pressure might be

32
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,430
a mediator of that relationship, if it
might be one of the things that

33
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,410
explains why obesity raises your risk of
heart disease.

34
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,570
So obesity causes you to have higher blood
pressure.

35
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,130
Higher blood pressure puts strain on your
heart and

36
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,900
increases your risk of heart disease.

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,630
So, that would be considered a mediating
variable rather than a confounder.

38
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,840
It's not causing a spurious association to
appear between obesity and heart disease.

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,220
Rather obesity does have a causal
relationship, is just one of

40
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:30,280
the ways that the relationship between
obesity and heart disease is mediated.

41
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,330
It's one of the things that explains it.

42
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,620
But again statistically, you're going to
look the same.

43
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,090
So it's all conceptually how we
distinguish those.

44
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,220
I'm just going to give you a couple of
examples of what mediation looks like,

45
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,190
and say a little bit about how we identify
mediators statistically.

46
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,000
So when people are talking of mediation,

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,480
they love to draw these nice little path
diagrams and little flow diagrams.

48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,700
So I think those are nice, I always like a
good picture.

49
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,130
So here's a, an example I picked out of a
recent article on the literature, and

50
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,410
was looking at physical activity as the
predictor, and eating self-regulation,

51
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,169
how well can you self-regulate in terms of
eating as the outcome variable.

52
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,070
And if you look at physical activity,
people who exercise a lot and

53
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,330
you look at people's ability to self
regulate their eating,

54
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,610
in fact you do find an association between
that predictor and that outcome.

55
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,400
And they do appear to be causally related,
not really through confounders but

56
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,460
one seems to have effects on the other.

57
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,590
Now, there might be a lot of.

58
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,640
There are variables here though, that help
to explain how physical

59
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,530
activity regulates eating, and that's what
this picture is showing here.

60
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,040
I'm going to just put this in statistical
terms for a minute.

61
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,130
So, here, look at this, this arrow right
here, which says the total effects path C.

62
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,450
So, this is, image that I were to was to
try to relate physical activity and

63
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,030
eating self-regulation with some kind of
statistical test.

64
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,510
Let's say I did a regression, and I get,
I'm going to just make up a,

65
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,020
you know, a regression coefficient here
for hypothetical.

66
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,120
Just to make it easy, a number that we can
deal with, but imagine that you.

67
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,980
You run a regression.

68
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,210
Physical activity's the predictor.

69
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,750
Eating self-regulation is the outcome.

70
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,150
And the beta coefficient from that
regression comes out to be 1.0,

71
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,650
showing there is a statistically
significant relationship here.

72
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,290
That's the magnitude 1.0.

73
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,770
So we then though, that's our simple
model.

74
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,530
We then go and say well maybe there are
things that explain the relationship.

75
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,900
Mediate the relationship between physical
activity and eating self-regulation and

76
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,764
here's an example.

77
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:31,300
Perhaps you exercise a lot you improve
your body image which in

78
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,070
turn help you to regulate your eating
better.

79
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,560
So let's say I then add to my regression
model a variable for

80
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,660
this dysfunctional body image investment,
body image basically.

81
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,200
And let's say the beta for that comes out
to be 0.25.

82
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,160
And when I put that in the model, my beta
of the direct effect of between

83
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,140
physical activity and self regulation goes
down, say it goes down to 0.75.

84
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,360
You notice how this body image is kind of
looking like a confounder.

85
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,740
Because when I put it in the model, the
relationship between physical activity and

86
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,080
eating self-regulation gets extenuated.

87
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,230
But it's not a confounder, it's just
explaining some of this relationship.

88
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,510
And, then, let's say I add depressive mood
to the model,

89
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,150
so if you exercise more that improves your
mood that pretty well established and

90
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,570
maybe if you have better mood.

91
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,450
That helps to improve your eating self
regulation.

92
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,570
So let's say I've dumped depressive mood
now, as another co variable in the model.

93
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,550
I'm not saying the beta coefficient for
that, also comes out to 0.25,

94
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,450
and my relationship between physical
activity and

95
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,380
eating self regulation goes down even
more.

96
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,580
Let's say I'm making this you know,

97
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,060
very simple numbers, but lets say it goes
to 0.5.

98
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,530
So essentially when I adjust for mood and
body image, I've cut down, I attenuated

99
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,898
my data coefficient between physical
activity and eating self regulation.

100
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:47,730
To my 50%.

101
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,540
That leftover effect of physical activity
we're going to call the direct effect.

102
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,390
So I'm going to put this on this dotted
line.

103
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,510
That's maybe the, what we, we, maybe we
have, accounted for

104
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,960
all possible mediators.

105
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,270
But when we account for the mediators we
know about, that's what's left over.

106
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,880
So we would call these the direct effects
of physical activity

107
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,450
on eating self-regulation.

108
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,010
So somehow physical activity directly
affects your eating.

109
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:17,030
You can imagine exercise certainly has
very profound impact on appetite hormones.

110
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,380
So that might be sort of a direct effect
on eating self regulation or

111
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,170
something of that nature.

112
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,740
But when we put these other things in the
model, we explain away some of

113
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,250
the relationship between physical activity
and eating self regulation.

114
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,340
Because these other variables are
mediators.

115
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,910
So the rest of the relationship between
physical activity and

116
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,300
eating self regulation, was driven by the
changes on body image and

117
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,030
the changes on depressive mood.

118
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:44,170
But depression and body image are not
confounders, because they're just one of

119
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:49,420
the ways that physical activity is able to
influence eating self regulation.

120
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,610
Just to illustrate one more example of
what mediation looks like, so imagine

121
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,420
we've got a predictor a parental education
that's my X my predictor variable and

122
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,380
my outcome here my Y is the BMI or waist
circumference of the child.

123
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,730
So there's an idea that if you have more
educated parents it does turn out that

124
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,895
they tend to have, children who are less
at risk for obesity.

125
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:16,540
And you can imagine that there's a number
of ways that,

126
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,320
number of ways that this relationship
might get mediated.

127
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,520
So again you know you can model this and

128
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,710
if you just put physic parental education
into the model, you'll find a big

129
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,400
relationship between parental education
and the child's weight or over weightness.

130
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,390
But if you start adding other things into
the model there is a lot of

131
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,190
things that can explain that relationship.

132
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,850
So for example parents who are more
educated,

133
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,860
they might be more likely to put their
kids in sports, that helps reduce the BMI.

134
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,550
Parents who are more educated might be
more likely to encourage their kids to

135
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,160
eat breakfast, and that might help keep
the BMI low.

136
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,410
They might be less likely to push sugary
drinks and

137
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,210
that keeps the BMI low and so on.

138
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,920
So again, if you adjust for these other
variables, they will

139
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,470
appear to reduce the relationship between
parental education and child BMI.

140
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:06,200
But in fact, that's because they're on the
causal pathway between those two things,

141
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,620
so that's a mediation.
