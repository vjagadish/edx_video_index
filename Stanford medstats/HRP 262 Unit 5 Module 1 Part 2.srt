1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,660
So I've told you what can go wrong if you

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,850
treat competing risks as censored in the
Kaplan Meyer analysis.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,650
But what's the correct thing to do?

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,340
When you want to do unadjusted analyses
like Kaplan Meyer and

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,210
you have competing risks how can you
handle it correctly?

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,860
So one very simple thing you can do is
just to do the Kaplan Meyer estimate but

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,150
focus only on event free survival and

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,340
what this means is you treat all the
competing risks as events.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,890
So you're essentially modeling the
probability of having any of the events as

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,950
opposed to being censored.

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,280
And this would be something like, rather
than looking at cause specific mortality,

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,940
you just look at overall mortality.

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,950
You'll get the correct and valid estimate
that way.

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,780
The problem with that, of course, is it's
very limited.

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,390
There are cases where you really want to
know about a particular event

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,860
within that group.

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,500
So for example if you're looking at a new
cancer drug, you will want to,

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,340
may want to know specifically about the
effect, of of the drug on progression of

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,410
the cancer, and you may care less about
some of these other competing risks.

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,020
So what if you want to look at specific
risks?

21
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,820
Then you have to use something called a
cumulative incidence analysis.

22
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,090
And what this does essentially is Kaplan
Meier estimates the probability

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,530
of survivals.

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,450
The cumul, cumulative incidence analysis
instead looks at

25
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,840
the probability of failure, and by turning
it around like that

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,060
we'll actually be able to get the correct
estimates.

27
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,840
We're going to look at the cumulative risk
of failure for

28
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,000
each of the competing events separately.

29
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,420
But let me just do a little review of what
event-free survival would look like.

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,320
What do we mean by the Kaplan–Meier
estimate of event-free survival?

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,310
It's quite straightforward.

32
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,600
What we're going to do is just count all
of the competing risks as events.

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,840
And everything else is censored.

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,340
And do normal Kaplan–Meier estimates.

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,250
So let me review that here.

36
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,030
Because we're going to need the estimates
of event-free survival in

37
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,620
the calculation of the cumulative
incidences.

38
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,500
So it's worth me walking you through how
you calculate this.

39
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,030
This is also a good review of
Kaplan–Meier.

40
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,840
So what I've got here is I've got a simple
little data set, a made up data set.

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,180
And I've got six people in the data set
who had things happen at various times.

42
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,760
There are two outcomes, death from
melanoma and death from other causes, and

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,040
then of course some people are censored.

44
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,938
Let me just show you how we would
calculate the Kaplan-Meier estimate of

45
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:17,950
event-free survival.

46
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,700
So of course at time zero, everybody is
still alive, nobody has died.

47
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,570
So our Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival
probability is 100%.

48
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:31,240
Our cumulative incidence are, which is one
minus the Kaplan-Meier estimate of,

49
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,315
survival, is going to be zero.

50
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:35,320
0%.
So nobody has died yet.

51
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,530
So we don't have any, deaths yet.

52
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,460
At ten minutes into the study we had a
death from melanoma.

53
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,300
There were six people at risk at that
time.

54
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,110
One of them died from melanoma.

55
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,888
Five out of six remained alive.

56
00:02:47,888 --> 00:02:52,980
So the Kaplan-Meier survival probability
at time ten is going to be five six.

57
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,180
Meaning the cumulative, the cumulative
chance of dying is one sixth,

58
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,260
one minus that.

59
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,410
At 20 months into the study, we have a
death from a different cause

60
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,110
other than melanoma, but again, all the
deaths are being lumped together here.

61
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,700
So, there were five people at risk at that
time.

62
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,410
Four out of five survived without dying,
in that interval.

63
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,670
So we are going to be multiplying four
fifths,

64
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,840
that's the chance of surviving that
particular time period.

65
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,600
But remember Kaplan-Meier estimates are
cumulative so we also have to multiply by

66
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,890
the chance of surviving up until then so
we are going to take the previous estimate

67
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,560
of survival five-sixths and multiply it
times this four out of five.

68
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,070
When we do that, we see that we get a
value of two-thirds.

69
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,410
Two-thirds probability of surviving.

70
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,240
The chance, the cumulative risk of dying,
that is one-third.

71
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,730
30 Months into this study, we are going
to,

72
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,760
we have at that point, We still have four
people at risk.

73
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,470
Three out of four survived that interval,
one dies from melanoma.

74
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,950
And we have to multiply that by the
previous estimate,

75
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,670
Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival, which
was two-thirds.

76
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,512
So take the three-fourths times the
two-thirds.

77
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:02,260
The threes will cancel, and we come up
with a value of one half probability of

78
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,310
survival up until 30 months, half chance
of dying.

79
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,280
At 40 months into the study somebody is
censored so

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,370
our probabilities do not change.

81
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,450
At fifty months into the study somebody
dies from other causes.

82
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,666
That's at depth, at that point, there were
two people left at risk.

83
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,010
One of them dies, one of them survives.

84
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,580
So the survival probability for that
interval is one out of two.

85
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,680
We multiply that with our probability of
our survival, up until now,

86
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,670
which was one half, we get a cumulative
probability of survival of one-fourth, so

87
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,190
the chance of dying up until then is
three-fourth.

88
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,200
The last thing that happens is a censoring
so none of our probabilities change.

89
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,740
So that's what our Kaplan-Meier
probabilities look like.

90
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,690
We can draw them on our typical
Kaplan-Meier curve.

91
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,170
See how that curve drops if you're doing
it in terms of survival.

92
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:56,430
Drops to five-sixths at ten and then drops
again to two-thirds at 20.

93
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,090
And this is not well drawn to scale but,
you get the idea.

94
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,100
Drops at 30.

95
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,660
Stays.

96
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,020
And drops again at 50 down to one quarter.

97
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,180
And then it looks something like that.

98
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,090
So not well drawn to scale, but it's going
to look something like that.

99
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,250
The cumulative incidents is just one minus
the survival curve.

100
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,170
That's going to start at zero percent.

101
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,600
And it leaps up to one sixth at ten months
into the study.

102
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,590
And then up to a third.

103
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,740
And then up to a half.

104
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,750
And again not well drawn to scale.

105
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,920
Scale but you get the idea, stays at a
half until we get to fifty months, and

106
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,480
then that jumps up to three quarters.

107
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,140
So something like that, again, not, not
well drawn, but you get the idea.

108
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,790
So three quarters, three quarters chance
of dying by the end of the study.

109
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,900
That's the Event-Free Survival.

110
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,060
And again, we're going to be using these
estimates in just a minute

111
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,680
in the Cumulative Incidence calculation.

112
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,500
So how do I do the cumulative incidence
calculation?

113
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,860
So first of all, the cumulative incidence
analysis separates the competing risks

114
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,940
from the event of interest.

115
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,190
So we're going to look at them separately.

116
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,930
We're going to calculate cumulative
incidence curve separately for each.

117
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,490
If there are no competing risks,

118
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,744
it turns out that this will be equivalent
to Kaplan-Meier methods.

119
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,550
We're going to focus on the failure
probabilities rather than

120
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,780
the survival probabilities.

121
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,510
That will allow us to get the math right
here.

122
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,490
And each event goes into a separate bin.

123
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,990
We're going to calculate a separate curve
for each event.

124
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,500
The reason that we can do the cumulative
incidence analysis, why this works, is we

125
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,550
have a property, which we had something we
learned about which said that the hazard

126
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,560
function, the hazard rate is equal to the
density divided by the survival.

127
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,250
So remember, all this means is that to get
the chance of dying in

128
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,700
a particular instance or in a particular
interval of time.

129
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,150
That's the probability of dying in that
interval,

130
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,170
divided by the probability of surviving up
until then.

131
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,415
We had this mathematical relationship
before.

132
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:51,170
So it's also true that the chance of dying
in any particular interval, that's

133
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,510
the density, the probability density, is
equal to the hazard times the survival.

134
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,200
Essentially, that's what we're going to be
using,

135
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,050
this little relationship, in calculating
the cumulative incident

136
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,110
We're going to calculate the chances of
surviving up until a certain time.

137
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,370
We're going to calculate the hazard of
dying within a given interval.

138
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,640
We're going to multiply those together.

139
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,600
That will give us the overall probability
of dying within a particular interval

140
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,760
We can take those probability densities
and

141
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,730
just add them up, and that will give us
the cumulative incidents.

142
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,520
Accumulative risk of dying.

143
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,530
So that's the general idea.

144
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,120
Let me just walk you through an example.

145
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,440
So using the same data, I've laid out the
chart already here.

146
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,040
What we're going to do we're going to look
at melanoma and

147
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,080
death from other causes separately.

148
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,800
So, we just calculated the event-free
survival probabilities.

149
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,210
So, let me fill those in now.

150
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,189
We just calculated these, so they should
be fresh on your mind.

151
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,910
We're going to need those in order to be
able to

152
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,130
calculate the cumulative incidences.

153
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,730
Then we're going to focus on melanoma to
start with.

154
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,980
So we're going to ask, what's the hazard
of melanoma?

155
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,440
So what is the change of getting a
melanoma death

156
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,850
if you've already survived up until now
out of everybody who's still surviving,

157
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,090
what's the chance that you die of melanoma
in the next interval.

158
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,960
So obviously that won't pertain to time
point zero, but

159
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,530
at time point ten we have indeed have a
death from melanoma.

160
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,390
There were six people at risk.

161
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,440
One out of six of them, had a death from
melanoma.

162
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,880
So the hazard out of everybody that was
still alive at that time The hazard of

163
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,420
dying form melanoma was one out of six.

164
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,170
The density therefore is we're going to
multiply the chance of

165
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,370
surviving the previous interval, so

166
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,860
we're actually going to be multiplying the
hazard times the probability of sur,

167
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,510
the event free survival probability from
the previous interval.

168
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,110
So we'll be multiplying the 1.0 times the
1 sixth here, so

169
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,380
the density here turns out to be 1 sixth.

170
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,570
The cummulative incidences were just
summing up the density.

171
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,643
So that's still 1/6.

172
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:53,030
We got to time point 20.

173
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,240
So now, we are going to say, alright.

174
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,690
In that interval, there was nobody who
died from melanoma.

175
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,190
So the hazard for melanoma in that
interval was actually zero.

176
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,690
So the melanoma density is also zero.

177
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,544
So we'd multiply zero times 5/6.

178
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:09,610
But that's just zero.

179
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,910
The cumulative incidence is we're adding
up the density so

180
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:17,420
that remains at 1/6 at 30 months of the
study we have another death of melanoma.

181
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,500
And so at that point there were one, two,
three, four people at risk.

182
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,160
One of them developed or died from
melanoma So

183
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,990
one out of four is the hazard, the chance
that if you made it up until now,

184
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,930
you're going to now die from melanoma in
this time interval.

185
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,040
The density therefore would be the
probability, the ongoing survival

186
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,560
probability previously, which was two
thirds times the hazard,

187
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,120
which is one fourth, we multiply those
together to get the density.

188
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,148
That's going to give us a probability of,
a density of one-sixth.

189
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:51,880
So a one-sixth chance that the, a person
would die in this interval, overall.

190
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,660
Kind of a marginal probability.

191
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,180
We can then sum that to the cumulative
incidence, which was that 1 sixth,

192
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,990
we add another one-sixth, we get
two-sixth.

193
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,530
So there was a two-sixth cumulative chance
of getting, of dying from melanoma.

194
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,610
Right here.

195
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,900
And now everything else doesn't involve
melanoma.

196
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,510
So the hazard of melanoma for the rest of
this is just zero.

197
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,450
So we just, the cumulative incidence
remains at two-sixth.

198
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,010
So that's for melanoma.

199
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,630
We then turn to death from other causes.

200
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,450
So the first thing that that happens is
the death from melanoma.

201
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,410
So there's no hazard of dying of other
causes.

202
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,050
So all of that remains at zero.

203
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,800
Then we can adjust from other causes at 20
month.

204
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,680
So at the point there were one, two,
three, four, five people at risk.

205
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,260
One out of five had died of other causes,
in that interval.

206
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,630
So those are out of everybody who survived
up until then,

207
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,410
that's the hazard of dying in that
interval.

208
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,390
We're going to multiply the hazard times
the previous the event

209
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,820
free survival probability from the
previous time interval.

210
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,110
So that's 5/6 times 1/5th which will give
us a value also of 1/6th.

211
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,330
So our cumulative incidents is now 1/6th.

212
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,530
We're adding up the densities to get the
cumulative of incidents.

213
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:04,300
Now we're going to go next thing that
happens is there is a death from melanoma,

214
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,600
so that doesn't change anything here, and

215
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,680
then the censored, that doesn't change
anything.

216
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,720
And, then we get another death from other
causes at the point at which there's two

217
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,450
people left at risk, so 1/2 would

218
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,350
be the hazard there out of two people who
survived up until now, one of them died.

219
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,212
so the hazard is 1/2.

220
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,450
We're multiplying.

221
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,940
By the event free survival probability
from the previous interval which was

222
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,920
also one half, so one half times one half
would give us one quarter.

223
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,130
And now we add our density.

224
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,890
We add that to the cumulative incidence.

225
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,370
So one-sixth, plus one-fourth.

226
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,710
Well, that's the same as 2 12ths plus 3
12ths, or 5 12ths.

227
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,100
And then, the censoring, of course, don't
change anything.

228
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,500
So, we end up with a cumulative
probability of dying of other causes

229
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,470
of 5 12ths.

230
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,360
Now, what's important here, is that the
overall probability of dying from

231
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,500
melanoma is 2 6th, the overall probability
of dying from other things is 5 12ths,

232
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:04,020
if you add that up, that's 4 12ths plus 5
12ths.

233
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,180
Which equals 9 twelfths which is also
equal to 3 quarters,

234
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,960
that's exactly the total probability of

235
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,700
dying from anything that we've got from
the event free survival analysis.

236
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,670
So this all adds up as it should.

237
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,619
Now let me just show you that if we did it
the wrong way things will not add up.

238
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,850
So now we're going to do it the wrong way.

239
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,510
That was the right way to do cumulative
incidence.

240
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,410
Now I'll just show you the wrong way to do
it just to show you

241
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,795
things don't add up if we do it the wrong
way.

242
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:30,267
So we do it the wrong way.

243
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:34,279
The wrong way of course is treating the
competing risks as censored and

244
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,798
just running regular old Kaplan–Meier.

245
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:41,240
So, I've done this here for the
Kaplan-Meier for melanoma specific death.

246
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,600
So, we start at 100%.

247
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,580
But somebody dies of melanoma at ten
months.

248
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,350
So, their Kaplan-Meier survival estimate
here would be 5/6.

249
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,085
One minus the Kaplan-Meier would
supposedly give us

250
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,120
the cumulative incidents.

251
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,270
But it's not going to be the right
cumalative incidents, as we'll see.

252
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,380
At 20 months, somebody dies from other
causes.

253
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,170
We're counting that as a censoring now.

254
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,150
So that doesn't change anything.

255
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,780
Thirty months, we get another death from
melanoma, so at that point,

256
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,910
there are four people at risk, so

257
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,970
three out of four survive without dying
from melanoma in that interval.

258
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,060
We multiply that by the 5 6ths.

259
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,952
We get a value of 5 8ths.

260
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,970
And then the one minus that is 3/8 and

261
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,410
then everything else stays the same
because there are no more melanoma events.

262
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,819
If we do the same thing for other death

263
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:39,220
The first death is a melanoma death, so
that doesn't change for other deaths.

264
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,650
That person just is counted as censored,
but at 20 months into the study,

265
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:48,166
then one there's five people at risk, four
out of five don't die from other causes,

266
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,410
one out of five dies from other causes.

267
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,680
So now 1 5th chance if we minus from the
Kaplan-Meier.

268
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,050
At 40 months, now it's a death from
melanoma, so we treat that as a censoring.

269
00:13:59,050 --> 00:13:59,940
Nothing changes.

270
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,570
The censoring itself doesn't change
anything.

271
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,850
Then finally, at 50 months, we get another
death from other causes.

272
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,360
At that point,

273
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,620
there is one out of two people at who has
the death and one out of two who survives.

274
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,250
We're going to multiply that by our
previous Kaplan-Meier survivor probability

275
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:22,150
of 4 5ths This gives us a probability if
we multiply these together of 2 5ths.

276
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,980
And so, one minus that would be 3 5ths,
and that will continue until the end.

277
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,480
We could plot these in little Kaplan-Meier
curves.

278
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,900
We can plot those cumulative incidences,
and if we do that,

279
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,420
we'll see that we end up with something
that's a little funny.

280
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,310
Because it doesn't match the cumulative
incidence calculations that we just,

281
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,440
just calculated.

282
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,980
And you can see that if we add up the 3
8ths plus the 3 5ths,

283
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,980
that is going to give us something that is
not equal to 3 4ths.

284
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:01,280
That's going to give us 15 40ths plus 24
40ths which is 39 40ths,

285
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,370
so that's going to mean that the
probability of dying is almost a 100%.

286
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,070
That seems wrong because actually two of
the people here were censored And

287
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,670
clearly does not match the 75% that we got
from the event-free survival analysis.

288
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,110
And we can, you can, if you actually draw
this on a little graphic, so for

289
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,570
melanoma, I start at zero percent.

290
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,650
I go up to 1 6th.

291
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,966
And then I go up to 3/8ths.

292
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:30,990
If we compared that with the correct
calculation,

293
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,410
what you'll see is that the correct
calculation is in fact lower than that.

294
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,110
That was an over estimate of the
cumulative incidence.

295
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,639
And same thing if we look at the incidence
from other deaths.

296
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,850
It jumps up here to 1 5th and

297
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:54,650
then jumps up here to 3 5ths, and that
also is

298
00:15:54,650 --> 00:16:00,690
an over estimate of the cumulative
incidents.

299
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,910
So if you compare that to the, the
cumulative incidence that

300
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,030
we calculated the proper way, you'll see
that that's, that, you know,

301
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,950
the proper curve is going to be lower than
that.

302
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,040
So that would be the wrong way to do it
and it shows you why you get the different

303
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,960
estimates and why the cumulative incidence
is the correct way to do it.

304
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,420
And just one more example,

305
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,160
this was another paperwork Somebody was
kind of illustrating this point.

306
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,650
So they're showing you here the
Kaplan-Meier method.

307
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,220
The incorrect method versus the correct
cumulative incidence method.

308
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,540
And this is the people who had kidney
disease.

309
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,090
They could either die while on dialysis or
they could get a transplant and

310
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,260
then they weren't at risk of dying from
dialysis, or

311
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,530
they could survive this is the event for
your survival meeting.

312
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,350
Neither of those things happened.

313
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,330
And you can see that the Kaplan–Meiers are
clearly wrong,

314
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,460
because, those three things have to add up
to a 100,

315
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,050
you know, 100% and two of the
Kaplan–Meiers add up to more than a 100%.

316
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,490
Well, obviously we can't have higher than
100% here.

317
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,930
So the correct analysis is the cumulative
incidence.

318
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:07,030
And you can see how off the Kaplan–Meier
estimates can be, as is illustrated here.

319
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,080
Now what about the multivariate situation?

320
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,710
I basically just set you up for the
univariate, the unadjusted situation,

321
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,080
we just want to look at basic
Kaplan-Meiers.

322
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,180
When we get to the multivariate case,

323
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,460
it kind of depends on what the point of
your analysis is.

324
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,900
If you care about absolute probability,
you are going to

325
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,110
get things wrong if you treat the
competing risks as censored values.

326
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,890
However, there's a lot of situations where
we're doing some kind of

327
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,690
explanatory analysis, and we don't really
care about the absolute probabilities.

328
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,620
We just want to compare, say the treatment
group to the control group.

329
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,920
It turns out that it's probably fine if
the absolute probabilities don't matter.

330
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,220
To just treat the competing events as
censored values in a Cox regression.

331
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,920
And the hazard ratios will probably be
reasonable.

332
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,770
But, keep in mind that if you're doing
some kind of predictive or

333
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,820
prognostic study and you're trying to
actually get those absolute probabilities,

334
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,580
treating the competing events as censored
will give you the wrong probability.

335
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,700
So if that's your goal, you need some kind
of more sophisticated model that is

336
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,530
going to take into account the different
competing risks.

337
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,820
One example of that is something called
the sub, subdistribution hazards model.

338
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,150
There are a couple of different ways of
handling that.

339
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,370
But you do need to think carefully if you
care about those absolute probabilities to

340
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,670
make sure that you get them right.

341
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,670
