[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,490
In this next module, we're going to talk
about diagnostic testing,

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,880
using as an example that CelluliteDX test
that

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,889
I set out as the teaser in the opener this
week.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,640
So when we're talking about diagnostic
testing,

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,560
we're talking about things like
sensitivity,

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,080
specificity, positive predictive value and
negative predictive value.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,450
I've already used these terms a little bit
this week.

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,160
Now I'm going to formally define them, and

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,180
we're going to do a little bit formal
calculation of them.

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,180
So first of all the senstivity is the
probability that if you

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,180
truly have the disease, that the
diagnostic test is going to catch it.

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,930
How sensitive is the test?

14
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,240
Specificity is the probability that if you
don't have the disease,

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,480
that the test is going to accurately
register as a negative.

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,720
You want both of those to be good.

17
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,970
Positive predictive value is the
probability that if you test positive for

18
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,290
the disease, you actually have the
disease.

19
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,960
This is usually what the patients are more
interested in, right?

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,320
If you have a positive test, what's the
chance that you actually have the disease?

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,490
We calculated this already today for a
couple of conditions.

22
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,720
Similarly, the negative predictive value,

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,350
is the probability that if you test
negative for

24
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,140
a disease, it's the probability that you
actually do not have the disease.

25
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,830
Now, unlike sensitivity and

26
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,270
specificity, which actually don't depend
on the prevalence of a disease that

27
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,100
only depend on how good the test is, the
positive predictive value and

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,230
negative predictive value depend directly
on the prevalence of the disease.

29
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,169
Of course, as well as how accurate the
test is.

30
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,990
So let's get back to this fun example that
CelluliteDX test.

31
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:47,490
So this is a test that the company sells
for about $250 a pop,

32
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,480
to, it's a genetic test, to tell women
whether or

33
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,800
not they are likely to develop moderate to
se, to severe cellulite.

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,840
So the idea is that a young woman might
take this test before she

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,700
develops cellulite, and it would give her
some information about whether or

36
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,430
not she's likely to develop cellulite, and
therefore she and

37
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,070
her doctor might be able to do something
together to mitigate her risk.

38
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,180
So here's the, the pitch the company has
on its website for this test.

39
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,270
They say a patient who tests positive has
approximately a 70% chance of

40
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,790
developing moderate to severe cellulite.

41
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,110
Notice that's the positive predicted
value.

42
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,850
A patient who tests negative,

43
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,580
has approximately a 50% chance of not
developing moderate to severe cellulite.

44
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,636
So that's the negative predictive value.

45
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:34,840
Now if you're thinking about this
carefully, right away you can see that

46
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,100
this test is not terribly useful right, so
if you test positive you have

47
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,552
a 70% chance of of ha, developing moderate
to sever cellulite, approximately.

48
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:51,590
And If you test negative, notice you still
have a 50%

49
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,930
chance of getting moderate to severe
cellulite, right?

50
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,959
It's not terribly different, 1 minus 50%
is 50%.

51
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,400
So you, you test positive, there's a 70%
chance.

52
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,028
If you tested negative, it's still a 50%
chance.

53
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:06,132
So right away you kind of see this, mm, is
this really that useful?

54
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:08,992
Even assuming that there's something you
can do to intervene and

55
00:03:08,992 --> 00:03:12,632
prevent the onset of cellulite, but it
gets even funnier than then this, okay, so

56
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:15,911
we're going to delve into this a little
bit more deeply into the numbers.

57
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:17,423
It's a great illustration of,

58
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:21,749
of diagnostic testing and the, the numbers
come out to be even funnier than this.

59
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,170
So where did the, first of all, where did
this test come from?

60
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:33,370
So the CelluliteDX test was developed
based on a case control study,

61
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,920
where researchers were looking at a
particular genetic variant.

62
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,350
And they were able to show that this
genetic variant was statistically

63
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,100
associated with moderate to severe
cellulite.

64
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,690
So it was a case controlled study.

65
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,820
Here's the data from that study.

66
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,030
They sampled 200 cases.

67
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,030
These are women who have, moderate to
severe cellulite.

68
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,660
And 200 controls, women who did not have
moderate to severe cellulite.

69
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,020
And then they tested them for this
particular genotype.

70
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,480
And if you carried a D allele, there, that
was associated with a significantly higher

71
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,570
risk of having moderate to severe
cellulite in this case control study.

72
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,640
Here are the numbers.

73
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,375
So, when you get a positive on the
CelluliteDX test,

74
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,437
all that means is that you carry a D
allele.

75
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:18,194
So let's, that, so again, the same numbers
are used for, if you have a positive on

76
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:22,580
the CelluliteDX test, that's the same as,
as having this genetic allele.

77
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,334
So now let's look at the test and who, and
the, and the, and

78
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:28,412
who actually has the disease, and right
from this two by two table,

79
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:31,350
we can calculate from these data
sensitivity and specificity.

80
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,680
And a lot of times when you're calculating
sensitivity and specificity from

81
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,030
actual data, you might having it, setting
it up in a two by two table like this.

82
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,777
We can also calculate this from a tree and
all those other things we learned, but

83
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:43,214
let's do it from a two by two table now.

84
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:44,781
So what's the sensitivity here?

85
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:49,214
So there are 200 women who truly have
cellulite.

86
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:51,983
Out of those women, those are the case
women,

87
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:54,687
168 of them tested positive on this test.

88
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:57,683
So that would make the sensitivity 84%.

89
00:04:57,683 --> 00:05:01,672
Notice that there were 32 women who
falsely tested negative out of 200 cases.

90
00:05:01,672 --> 00:05:07,000
The specificity is, 26% because if you
look carefully, there were 200 women who

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,097
did not have cellulite, only 52 of them
actually tested negative on this test.

92
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:14,615
So this genetic variant actually really
common.

93
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:17,623
So it's much more common to get a positive
result from this test then from a,

94
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:19,020
then to get a negative test.

95
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,990
But the specificity here was 26%.

96
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,540
In other words, there were 148 false
positives.

97
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,450
148 women out of the control group falsely
tested positive on this test.

98
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,970
So that's the sensitivity and specificity.

99
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,970
And if you to the company website, they
have a nice little brochure,

100
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,210
where they lay out the calculation of
sensitivity and specificity for you.

101
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,930
And they did it correctly.

102
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,350
What's really fun about this problem, is,
if I ask you

103
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,940
to calculate the positive predictive
value, it's actually a little bit tricky.

104
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,740
So this is a really good exercise, I
think, because if I just give you

105
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,070
the data in the two by two table, when I
give this to students and I say,

106
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,970
calculate the positive predictive value,
everybody's tempted to say, oh well,

107
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,950
there were 316 people who tested positive,
168 of them actually have cellulite.

108
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,880
So that's the positive predictive value.

109
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,170
That is in fact incorrect, okay?

110
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,860
So why is that not correct?

111
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,410
It's, keep in mind, the study design here.

112
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,820
This is a case controlled study.

113
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,750
So the prevalence of the condition, of
having moderate to severe cellulite,

114
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,280
is different in the study sample, than it
is in the general population.

115
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,540
And remember, positive predictive value
depends on the prevalence of disease.

116
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,220
So we have to factor in, the actual
prevalence of the disease in the general

117
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,680
population here in order to calculate
positive predictive value, for this test.

118
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,700
So that's a little tricky.

119
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,530
To the company's credit if you go read
their little brochure they say,

120
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,970
oh well they knew they had to incorporate
the actual prevalence.

121
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,800
They must have a statistician involved.

122
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,050
So they say, oh yeah we used Bayes' rule
to calculate it.

123
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,860
So indeed they used Bayes' rule to
incorporate the true prevalence of

124
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,050
cellulite in the population.

125
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,970
So, that's a great example of where Bayes'
Rule can be useful.

126
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,138
So let's actually do this.

127
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:06,880
Let's use Bayes' Rule to calculate the
positive predictive value,

128
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,470
incorporating the true prevalence of
cellulite in the population.

129
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,600
So the company said that the true
prevalence of moderate cellulite in

130
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,150
women was 65%.

131
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,490
That sounds reasonable to me, so we'll
assume that's, that's reasonable.

132
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,730
So now we can use Bayes' Rule to
incorporate that.

133
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,621
Notice that that's higher then in case
control study where's its only 50%.

134
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,310
So, let's, here's how we would apply
Bayes' rule.

135
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,040
We want to know the positive predictive
value.

136
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,790
We want to know the probability that you
will get moderate to severe cellulite,

137
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,630
if you test positive on this test.

138
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,560
Well, we can just apply Bayes' rule here,
so

139
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,672
that's going to be equal to the posit,
probability of testing positive,

140
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:50,510
given that you actually are a woman who's
going to get cellulite,

141
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,280
times the marginal probability of getting
cellulite, that's the prevalence in

142
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,220
the population, over the marginal
probability of testing positive at all.

143
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,410
Alright.
So what's the probability that you're

144
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,220
going to test positive given that you are
positive?

145
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,690
Well, that's the sensitivity of the test.

146
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,331
We just saw that that was 84%.

147
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,550
What's the margin of probability of having
moderate to severe cellulite?

148
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,020
The company just told us that that's 65%
in the general population,

149
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,230
so that's where we're incorporating that
number.

150
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,440
What's the marginal probability of testing
positive?

151
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,660
Well, there are two ways you could test
positive.

152
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,050
You could be one of those of 65% of women,

153
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,360
who actually has moderate to severe
cellulite, or

154
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,250
is going to get it and, your chance of
testing positive is 84%, the sensitivity.

155
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,770
Or, you can be one of the 35% of women,

156
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,630
who is not destined to get moderate to
severe cellulite.

157
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,570
Your chance of testing positive on this
test is actually 74%.

158
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,500
That's 1 minus the specificity.

159
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,570
Remember the specificity was 26%.

160
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,410
That means the false positive rate is 74%.

161
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,160
So that's the marginal probability of
testing positive.

162
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,670
When you add that up, it comes out to be
.805 in our denominator.

163
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,710
So, we can put all these numbers together.

164
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,732
So .84, times 0.65, that's equal to

165
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:12,396
.546 we divide that by the denominator of
.805,

166
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:18,285
we get that the positive predictive value
is 67.8%.

167
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:20,865
All right, so the, the company calculated
that,

168
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:24,885
in their literature, now in their
marketing material, they rounded that up,

169
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:28,785
so they said, oh, your, the, the actual
probability that you're going to

170
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:33,363
get moderate to severe cellulite if you
test positive is 60, it's about 68%.

171
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:35,846
Well they said, they rounded that up to
approximately 70%.

172
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:39,896
They were trying to boost it, make it
look, just look a little bit better.

173
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:41,832
Okay.

174
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,496
Now notice that that's an application of
Bayes' Rule.

175
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:47,681
For those of you who are more comfortable
using the tree, which most students

176
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:50,900
are when they first start this material,
you could also do this on the tree.

177
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,800
So let me just quickly show you how to do
it on the tree.

178
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,700
So, and then I'm going to show you how to
do it using a 2 by 2 table.

179
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,790
I'm going to give you many ways to get the
right answer.

180
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,750
And remember, with probability there's
many ways to get the right answer.

181
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,510
Some are more efficient than others.

182
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,770
Some are, are better for when you're
learning.

183
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,480
So, the first thing is, your either one of
these women get destined to

184
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,970
get the cellulite or you're not.

185
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,101
That's 65% prevalence and 1 minus 65% is
35%, so

186
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:15,730
that's whether or not you truly have the
disease.

187
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,740
Then, you are either going to test
positive on this CelluliteDX test or not.

188
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,980
If you actually have the disease, the
sensitivity again is 84%,

189
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,823
so your chance of not testing positive is
16%.

190
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,750
If you don't have the disease, you still
have a 74% chance of testing positive, and

191
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,350
you have a 26% chance of not testing
positive.

192
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,790
We can multiply across the branches, so

193
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,916
the upper branch is .546, this one is
.104.

194
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:47,570
This one is .259, this one is .091.

195
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,560
I just got those by multiplying across the
branches.

196
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,310
Notice if I add all these up, it sums up
to exactly 1, so I've done it right.

197
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,780
So now, once I know that you've tested
positive, I,

198
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,380
then I know that you're either on this
branch, or your on this branch.

199
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,660
So once you know you tested positive,

200
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,090
you're on one of those branches, which of
those is actually having cellulite?

201
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,380
Only the top branch.

202
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,065
So the probability that you're actually
going to get the disease,

203
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:13,611
given that you tested positive in this
case,

204
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:19,500
will be .546 divided by .259, plus .546,
and that again, comes out to be 67.8%.

205
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,420
So you can solve it

206
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,090
this way if you're more comfortable still
with the tree, and Bayes' Rule.

207
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,513
And I'm going to show you even one more
way to solve it.

208
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:30,260
So alternatively we can use a little trick
with 2 by 2 tables, and

209
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,390
a lot of students find it easier to
calculate it in this way, so if you're

210
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,780
more comfortable with a 2 by 2 table, this
is yet another way to get this right.

211
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,900
So, to solve for positive predictive and
negative predictive value,

212
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,510
you could incorporate the true prevalence
by just doing a little 2 by 2 table and

213
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,250
assuming that you have a denominator of
100 people.

214
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,310
Why a hundred, why am I picking a hundred
here?

215
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,120
Well, it's easy to deal with percentages.

216
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,320
If you treat them as whole numbers, so if
we start with 100 people,

217
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,710
then all the percentages just become whole
numbers.

218
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,526
So, for example, rather than talking about
65%, or

219
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:07,010
35%, I can say if I have a hundred women
in the general population,

220
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:11,510
65 of them would have cellulite, and 35
would not have cellulite, right, so

221
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,359
I can set it out this way, and make it
super easy to do these calculations.

222
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,720
Then you can apply the sensitivity and
specificity to figure out how many of

223
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,100
them are going to test positive and test
negative.

224
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,680
So, for example, we start with the
prevalence of the disease and

225
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,170
then we know, out of the 65 women who have
the disease, 84% of them

226
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,623
are going to correctly test positive, so
we can fill in that cell with a 55.

227
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,200
Out of the 35 women who truly do not have
the disease,

228
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,450
only 26% of them, that's a specificity,
are going to test negative.

229
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,030
So we're going fill in that cell with a 9
there.

230
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,990
Then you can just subtract.

231
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,825
Now we have enough information to be able
to fill in rest of the cells.

232
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:58,641
So for example, 65 minus 55 is 10.

233
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:02,800
35 minus 9 will get us to 24, 26.

234
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,380
So we can fill in all of those cells.

235
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,940
So now we have enough information.

236
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,961
We have the correct prevalence of the
disease in a population to

237
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:14,680
calculate positive predictive value
directly from the 2 by 2 table.

238
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,280
And again, maybe students find it easier
to do it this way, because dealing with

239
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,299
whole numbers is always easier than
dealing with fractions and probabilities.

240
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,670
So what will the positive predictive value
be?

241
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:31,000
There are 81 women who will test positive,
out of a sample of 100 women.

242
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,460
Out of that, those 81,

243
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,900
55 of them will truly go on to get
moderate to severe cellulite.

244
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,346
So the positive predictive value here is
68%,

245
00:13:39,346 --> 00:13:41,860
the same 68% we calculated in two other
ways.

246
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,730
What's the negative predictive value?

247
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:49,410
The negative predictive value, we would
calculate by recognizing that there

248
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,230
are 19 women in the general population who
will get a negative on this test.

249
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:58,140
Of those 19, only nine of them will go on
to not get cellulite.

250
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,800
Ten of them will actually go on to get
cellulite.

251
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,218
So, the negative predictive value here, is
47%.

252
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:08,444
So 47% of those who test negative, will
not get cellulite.

253
00:14:08,444 --> 00:14:09,494
In other words,

254
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:14,970
now remember that the company, rounded
that up to 50% when they reported it.

255
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,070
So they said, 50% of those who test
negative will not get cellulite.

256
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,770
So they're doing a little rounding again,
in their favor to look it,

257
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,520
make it look more interesting.

258
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,820
In other words, though, another way to say
it, rather than putting it negative

259
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,550
predictive value, which is probably a
little bit more difficult for most people

260
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:34,450
to understand, the better way to say it
would be that 53% will get cellulite.

261
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,000
So in other words, if you test negative
for

262
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,780
this test, you still have a 53% chance of
going on to get cellulite.

263
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,340
So, just to summarize here, if you don't
take the test,

264
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,560
your chance of getting moderate to severe
cellulite is 65%, right,

265
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,660
because that's the prevalence, the risk of
the disease in the general population.

266
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,096
So, if you don't take the test, you have a
65% chance.

267
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:56,090
Let's say you take the test.

268
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,990
If you take the test, four out of five
women who take the test are actually

269
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,350
going to test positive, and if you take
the test and you find out you're positive,

270
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:09,190
your risk moves from 65%, just barely a
little bit to 68%.

271
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:15,255
So, most women are going to find out their
risk moved up just a tiny 3%.

272
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:17,854
One out of the five women will test
negative.

273
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:18,596
Because their,

274
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:22,660
this is just has to do with the prevalence
of the particular genetic variant.

275
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,610
It's pretty rare.

276
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:30,500
If you test negative, then your risk goes
down from 65%, down to 53%.

277
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,320
So it moves slightly more down 12% but
still is not that different than

278
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:40,550
just your risk to begin with your prior
probability, it's not changed that much.

279
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,210
So, our conclusion would be then, the test
is basically useless, and

280
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,390
barely moves your probability from just
what, what your prior probability,

281
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,760
your starting probability was and most of
it are going to get, test positive an, and

282
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,870
their prior probability basically doesn't
change at all.

283
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,630
So, it's not the most useful test in the
world but

284
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:04,280
it's a really fun example for illustrating
diagnostic testing and Bayes' Rule.

285
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,640
And just to conclude this module, again,
sensitivity and specificity don't depend

286
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,640
on the prevalence of the disease, but
positive predicative value and

287
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,390
negative predicative value do depend on
the prevalence.

288
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,330
So make sure that you're always
incorporating that correctly as we

289
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,450
did in the example today.

290
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,860
And finally, this genetic variant was
significantly associated with cellulite,

291
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,967
there was a significant association there.

292
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:31,147
You can see from the example today though,
that that doesn't mean just

293
00:16:31,147 --> 00:16:34,698
because something is significantly
associated, that it, that doesn't mean

294
00:16:34,698 --> 00:16:38,139
that it's going to make a useful screening
test, so I'd keep that in mind.

295
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:38,639
