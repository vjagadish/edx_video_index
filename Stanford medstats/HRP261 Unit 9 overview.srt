00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,140
Welcome to unit nine, which is the final
unit of this course.

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,960
I've kept this unit a little bit shorter,

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,350
just to make sure you have some extra time
to study for the final exam.

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,940
So this week, we're going to wrap up the
course by talking about

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,550
the regression methods that are used when
you have correlated observations.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,910
And these are conditional logistic
regression and GEE modeling.

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:29,970
Let me go back to the chart of statistical
tests that I showed you at

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,630
the beginning of this course.

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,230
I'll just show you now that we have
actually covered almost all of these at

10
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:35,890
this point.

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,365
So in the first week of the course we
covered a number of tests that were

12
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:46,060
non-regression methods, we then spent many
weeks covering logistic regression, and

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,320
last week, additionally, I told you about
multinomial and ordinal

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,590
logistic regression, which are just
alternate versions of logistic regression.

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,970
Last week, I also told you about a, an
entirely different type of

16
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,320
outcome variable that you might want to
add to your chart as another row.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,150
Which is, when you have count data as your
outcome.

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,700
You have count outcomes you probably
going to want to use poisson regression or

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,640
negative binomial regression as we talked
about last week.

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,190
The test that we haven't covered yet

21
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,100
that we are going to get to this week are
conditional logistic regression and

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,480
GEE modeling, again these are regression
techniques for

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,380
when you have correlated observations.

24
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,190
Before I jump into these however I thought
it would be fun to start this week

25
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,920
with a little preview to the final exam,
since that's coming up soon.

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,100
So I took two questions off of a previous
year's final exam just to

27
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,390
give you a sense of the types of questions
I might be asking.

28
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,610
If you want, feel free to pause the video
and attempt this question on your own.

29
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,940
I'm now going to just walk through it.

30
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,110
So this was a study cross-sectional study
of people,

31
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,130
they were looking to see about skin
wrinkling.

32
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,790
And wrinkles was measured on a scale of
one to six,

33
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,820
so this an ordinal outcome variable.

34
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,040
That's a hint that's going to help you get
the right answer here.

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,430
They wanted to say whether or not your
occupation, if you work outside or

36
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,510
indoors and outdoors, or only indoors,
does that contribute to wrinkling?

37
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,450
So here's some SAS output, and this is
something I might do on the final exam is

38
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,460
just to give you some out put from SAS,
from SAS, and have you interpret it.

39
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,370
So the question, this question is asking
you what type of analysis did

40
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,430
the authors want to generate this output?

41
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,730
So you look at the output,

42
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,870
you'll notice that they're five intercepts
in this model.

43
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,050
So that's a clue that this either going to
be ordinal logistic regression or

44
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,290
multinomial logistic regression.

45
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,460
And I was very kind when I made this
question because I

46
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,980
didn't even put multinomial as a, as a
choice here.

47
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,230
So you can actually get this down to
ordinal logistic regression pretty easily.

48
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,270
However, what if I'd also given the choice
of multinomial logistic regression?

49
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,430
How would you know that this was ordinal
and not multinomial?

50
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,910
Well, you'd know that because there's only
a single beta estimate,

51
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,380
a single beta parameter, for each of the
predictors in the model.

52
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,780
So that's how you can tell that this is
ordinal logistic, rather than multinomial.

53
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,880
Here's the second question again, if you
want to pause the video and

54
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,606
try this on your own, it'd be a good
practice for the final exam.

55
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:14,920
If not, I'm just going to walk through it.

56
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,740
So this question was asking you to
calculate the predicted probability of

57
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,880
having severe skin wrinkling for somebody
who works outdoors.

58
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,810
So we're going to be calculating a
predicted probability based on the model.

59
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,500
Now this one's slightly tricky, because
you have to figure out,

60
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
which intercept am I going to be using
here and which beta?

61
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,010
So, we know, of course,

62
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,520
that the predictive probability from
logistic regression always looks like

63
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,330
e raised to something over 1 plus e raised
to something.

64
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,860
But then we have to fill in that something
here.

65
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,510
So the trick here is that the wrinkle
outcome was again an ordinal variable.

66
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,400
It went from no wrinkling all the way up
to severe wrinkling, and

67
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,990
severe wrinkling is the smallest category.

68
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,860
Remember that ordinal logistic regression
is cumulative.

69
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,140
The very top category is the severe
category.

70
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,720
So you know that,

71
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,630
that category is going to have the fewest
number of people in it.

72
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,320
What's a little tricky, is that when SAS
actually puts the outmake as the output,

73
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,440
it just calls them intercept 1, 2, 3, 4 or
5, but that 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 don't

74
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,190
necessarily correspond to the numbering
that was used for the actual variable.

75
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,630
They're just labeling them as they come.

76
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,510
So you actually have to look at the
intercept values and

77
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,380
figure out which logit value here
represents the smallest group, and

78
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,620
that's going to be the smallest logit.

79
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,670
That would represent the smallest
percentage of people.

80
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,482
You know that a percentage that's,

81
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:38,188
a logit that's negative, is going to mean
less than 50%.

82
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:40,490
So that's going to be the smallest group.

83
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,090
We're going to be using that intercept,
and

84
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,070
then the predictive variable here is a
dummy coded variable.

85
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,690
This person that we want to get the
predicted probability for

86
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,900
had an outdoor job.

87
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,970
So we're going to using the beta of 0.8817
they did not have a mixed job.

88
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,360
So we're going to just plug in now the
intercept for

89
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,770
this person and their beta coefficient.

90
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,280
It's dummy coded, so you're just
multiplying that beta by one.

91
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,900
You are going to need a calculator
available for the final exam so

92
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,830
that you can plug and chug simple numbers
like this.

93
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,510
So if you plug this into a calculator and

94
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,010
you calculate it out, it comes to out to
be about 40%.

95
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,330
So the correct answer here would be a.

96
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,130
So that's just a little preview to the
kinds of things that might show up on

97
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:25,930
the final exam.
