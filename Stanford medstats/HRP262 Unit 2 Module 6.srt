1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,410
In this next module, I'll run through a
quick example of the use of

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,140
Weibull regression in the literature.

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,750
So, this was a study that was looking at
whether or not being either religious or

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,980
spiritual have any relationship to the
onset of depression.

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,140
And the outcome of this study was the time
to depression, so

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,610
they used survival analysis methods.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,530
These are some data from Canada, there was
about 12,000 people.

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,900
They were all verified to be not depressed
at baseline in 1994,

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,280
and they were followed during 14 years.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,570
And again, the outcome is time to
depression.

11
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,030
They used Weibull proportional hazards
regression model to model the risk

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,920
of depression.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,260
And the, they were most interested in
religious attendance and

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,540
spirit, spirituality as potential
predictors of whether or

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,050
not you would end up getting depressed.

16
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,560
So, I'll just show you the survival
curves.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,040
These survival curves, as you can see,
they're very smooth.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,310
These come out of the Weibull regression
model that they fit.

19
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,370
And this is the survival curves looking at
religious attendance as the predictor.

20
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,648
So, we have survival on the y-axis
starting at 100% because there's nobody

21
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:12,370
depressed at the beginning.

22
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,540
At baseline everybody was non-depressed.

23
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,140
And it falls off from there.

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,190
You can see the scale of the y-axis, it
only goes down to about 75%.

25
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,800
So, by the end of the study, about 20% of
people had become depressed.

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,840
You have 80, 80% chance of not being
depressed by then.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,860
This is time in months.

28
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,680
And there is three curves.

29
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,890
So the top, the bottom curve are the
people who do not attend regular religious

30
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,850
services, and you can see that they get
depressed more quickly, so

31
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,890
their survival curve drops off faster.

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,860
The ones who occasionally go to religious
services, they're somewhere in the middle.

33
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,560
And the ones who attend monthly or more
are on the top, having the,

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,105
the lowest rate of development of
depression.

35
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:58,460
It isn't a huge effect, but there is some
separation between those curves.

36
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,910
So, they did find an effect here.

37
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,400
They did not find any relationship between
just spirituality in general and

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,150
the onset of depression for whatever
reason.

39
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,890
I'll show you the table that they
presented in their paper.

40
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,880
Again, this is based on a Weibull
regression model, as they indicate here.

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,930
So, we'll scroll down to the predictor
they cared most about,

42
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,000
which is this frequency of religious
attendance.

43
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,940
And you can see that the reference
category was those who did not attend,

44
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,010
occasionally had a hazard ratio of just a
little below one.

45
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,294
Indicating a tiny bit of protection
against depression and then monthly or

46
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:34,410
more had a hazard ratio of 0.78.

47
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,660
So, not a huge effect.

48
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,735
But we would say that the rate of
depression was reduced by

49
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:43,720
22% in those with frequent religious
attendance, and the P value here was 0.01.

50
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,290
The confidence interval does not cross
one.

51
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,960
So, they did find a significant effect
here.

52
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,140
Just for fun, let's look through some of
the other hazard ratios from their model.

53
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,353
The, again, the spirituality variable did
not come out significant, so

54
00:02:55,353 --> 00:02:57,285
they didn't include it in the table here.

55
00:02:57,285 --> 00:03:01,425
But here's all the other things that they
adjusted for, which could be

56
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:06,186
potential confounders, of course, so they,
they put gender into the model, so

57
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:11,154
female gender actually had a higher rate
of becoming depressed some other ones,

58
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:13,362
education, so if you have a college or

59
00:03:13,362 --> 00:03:18,990
university degree that predicted less
depression over time, so that's good.

60
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,350
If you don't have any history of family
depr of depression in the family,

61
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,400
that's protective.

62
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,810
If you've never had any episodes of
depression before,

63
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,540
that's very protective, as you can see
here.

64
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,000
That's a really low hazard ratio.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,250
Perceived social support was also
protective,

66
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,220
having more social support and, perhaps
you attend religious services a lot,

67
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,820
you have some kind of community and
support there.

68
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,510
The other thing that I'll point out is
that they give the additional parameter

69
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,520
for the Weibull model is 1.68, and you can
see that it is statistically significant,

70
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,920
the 95% confidence interval does not cross
one.

71
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,078
So this is indicating that we probably are
better off fitting a Weibull model

72
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:59,990
than an exponential here because the scale
parameter clearly doesn't look to be wide.

73
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,900
And this is above one, so it's indicating
that depression is increasing.

74
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,450
The rate of depression is increasing
during the study follow up period.

75
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,920
So, this is just an example of Weibull
regression in the literature.
