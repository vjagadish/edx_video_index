1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,950
In this next module, we're going to do a
practical example.

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,120
I'm going to walk you through how to
interrupt linear regression results in

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,681
a medical paper.

4
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:20,410
We're going to go back to this vitamin D
and

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,730
cognitive function study that I mentioned
in the teaser and

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,050
that was also the basis of all the
hypothetical data I used this week.

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,910
Now, I'm going to show you the result from
the actual study.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,400
So, the headlines that came out in 2009,
this was widely covered in the news media,

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,010
was things like Brighten the twilight
years,

10
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,420
Sunshine vitamin boosts brain function in
the elderly.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,799
And the articles made the point that this
is some of the strongest evidence yet

12
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,210
of a link between vitamin D levels and
cognitive function.

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,280
So, remember what this study was.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,240
They, this was a large cross-sectional
study of middle-aged and

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,470
older men in Europe.

16
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,330
They measured their vitamin D levels at
one time point.

17
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,480
They also had them take some various
cognitive tests to

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,660
measure their cognitive function.

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,950
There were actually a number of cognitive
tests they took.

20
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,660
I've been focusing so far on the DSST
scores, but

21
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll show you some others in a minute.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,160
And they found an association between
those things.

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,370
We're going to kind of walk through that
in a minute.

24
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,460
But this study had a number of resolve
linear regression.

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,450
There are lots of linear regressions were,
were on.

26
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,510
And the number of the tables involved the
output from linear regression.

27
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,110
So, we're going to walk through it.

28
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,490
We're going to evaluate how strong this
evidence is.

29
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,906
So, here's table two from that paper, it's
rather large and, and cumbersome.

30
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:39,730
But in a minute, I'm going to go through
it bit by bit, and kind of zoom in, here.

31
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,980
So this table was trying to get at what
are some of the potential confounders

32
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,610
between, that might confound the
relationship between vitamin D level and

33
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,220
cognitive function?

34
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,690
So, what it's showing you here is,

35
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,230
there, each of the columns represents a
different outcome variable.

36
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,590
So, the first column is showing the
results of a bunch of linear regressions,

37
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,931
where the outcome variable was a cognitive
test called the ROCF copy score.

38
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:08,900
There are, there were four cognitive tests
administered here,

39
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,240
so we get results for the ROCF copy score,

40
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,920
the ROCF recall score, the CTRM score, and
also the DSST score.

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,556
The one I've been talking the most about.

42
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:25,475
And we also get a series of models which
use vitamin D as the outcome variable.

43
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:28,280
Because remember to be a cofounder, you
have to

44
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,680
be related both to the predictor variable
and to the outcome variable.

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,260
So, we're trying to access what are,

46
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,640
which of these third variables is related
to both cognitive function and vitamin D.

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,660
And thus, might be confounding that
relationship.

48
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,970
Now, I'm going to walk you through, what,

49
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,430
these are all beta coefficients that
you're seeing here.

50
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,730
I'm going to walk you through what these
beta coefficients mean and

51
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,390
how to interpret them.

52
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,840
Let's start with age.

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,985
Age is a continuous predictor.

54
00:02:57,985 --> 00:03:00,520
It's measured in units of years.

55
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,710
And for continuous predictors, you need to
know what the units of measurements are.

56
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,070
And they nicely put that for you in the
table here, so you have it.

57
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,315
There's a lot of data here.

58
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,435
So, I'm just going to go over a couple of
these.

59
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:16,640
So, first of all, if you kind of scroll
across all the different cognitive tests,

60
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,160
you'll notice that there's a little star
beside each of those estimates going.

61
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,550
As your age goes up, your cognitive
function goes down on all of

62
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,410
those tests and it is statistically
significant.

63
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,615
That's not surprising.

64
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:32,870
Interestingly, I'll focus, for the moment,
on the vitamin D.

65
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,644
The vitamin D was not that strongly
related to age in the study.

66
00:03:36,644 --> 00:03:37,960
So, the coeffecient here, the beta
co-efficient is negative 0.0135.

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,550
So, that does mean that your, as your age
goes up,

68
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,680
you vita, your outcome here is vitamin D.

69
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,620
So, as your age goes up, your vitamin D
level goes down.

70
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,100
For every one year increase in age,

71
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,380
we are decreasing our vitamin D levels by
an average of 0.0135.

72
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,970
So, it's not a big effect, and it's not
statistically significant.

73
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,710
The, let's look at the beta coefficient
for DSST score.

74
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,274
So, for DSST score, the beta coefficient
is negative 0.415.

75
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:14,554
That says that for every one year increase
in age,

76
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:19,556
your DSST score is going down by 0.415 of
a point, almost a half a point.

77
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:21,606
So, that's a pretty big effect.

78
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:23,902
It is statistically significant.

79
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:28,002
These models, right here, have not been
adjusted for anything.

80
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:33,110
The rest of the models that I'm going to
show you are adjusted only for age.

81
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,450
And, and nothing else.

82
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,808
Now, I want to show you an example of a
categorical predictor.

83
00:04:38,808 --> 00:04:42,494
So, they also measured depression on these
men.

84
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:47,926
They measured depression on the BDI, the
Beck Depression Inventory.

85
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:51,440
They classified men into normal, meaning
no depression,

86
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,410
mild to borderline depression, and
moderate to extreme depression.

87
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,740
They use those three groups then, in
linear regression.

88
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,500
And again, these models are all adjusted
for age, but nothing else.

89
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,570
I'm going to, let's choose the CTRM score
here, just for

90
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,330
fun to look at something different.

91
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,570
So, the way you would interpret these
coefficients,

92
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,180
everything is compared to the reference
group.

93
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,050
So, the reference group is the normal.

94
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,350
Then, we see that, if you are, have mild
to borderline depression,

95
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,200
compared with being having no depression,
would be normal.

96
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,230
You go down in your CTRM score by 0.849.

97
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,290
And that is statistically significant.

98
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,920
If you're in the moderate to extreme,

99
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,538
the higher depression group, you go down
on average by 1.4 points.

100
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:36,890
If you're in moderate to extreme
depression,

101
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,900
compared with if you're normal.

102
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,810
And that also is statistically
significant.

103
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,470
Interestingly, let's look at the vitamin
D,

104
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,860
where vitamin D is outcome in those
models.

105
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,480
So, if you go, if you're in the mild to
borderline depression group,

106
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,610
your vitamin D levels go down, 9.641 nmol
per liter.

107
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,070
So, that's a pretty big drop in vitamin D
with depression.

108
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,139
And if you're in the highest depression
group, compared with normal,

109
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,020
your vitamin D levels are 13.93 nmol per
liter lower.

110
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,130
So, those are some big drops in vitamin D.

111
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,200
So, interestingly, if you're depressed,

112
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,520
you're likely to have lower levels of
vitamin D.

113
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,580
You're also likely to have lower levels of
cognitive score.

114
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,150
So, this is definitely a potential
confounder here.

115
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,670
Body mass index, the measure of your, how
big you are,

116
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,776
your size, is also a continuous predictor.

117
00:06:28,776 --> 00:06:31,180
Let's look at DSST score.

118
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,970
So, as your body mass index goes
up,actually,

119
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,004
your cognitive function goes down every
one unit increase in BMI.

120
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:40,550
BMI is measured in kilograms per meter
squared,

121
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,878
correlated in a 0.115 decrease in your
DSST score.

122
00:06:44,878 --> 00:06:48,970
So, not a huge effect, but it is
statistically significant.

123
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,580
The, for vitamin D, vitamin D was also
related to BMI.

124
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,377
So, as your BMI goes up for every one unit
increase in, in your BMI,

125
00:06:57,377 --> 00:07:02,740
your vitamin D levels goes to down 0.811
nmol per liter on average.

126
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,180
And that is statistically significant.

127
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,622
So again, BMI could also be a confounder.

128
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:09,050
As yor BMI goes up, your vitamin D levels
go down, and

129
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,050
so does your cognitive function.

130
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,820
There's another categorical variable,
physical activity.

131
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,950
So, this is the low, medium and high
exercise groups.

132
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,980
And, let's look at, let's look at CTRM
score.

133
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,310
So, for CTRM score, if you're in the
middle exercise group,

134
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:32,490
you are about 1.283 points higher on your
CTRM score than the low exercise group.

135
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,950
And that was significant.

136
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,850
And the highest exercise group was, also
about a point,

137
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,830
a little over a point higher than the low
exercise group, in CTRM.

138
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,690
CTRM score also statistically significant.

139
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,255
So, more exercise seems to be correlated
with somewhat bigger cognitive function.

140
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:54,070
For interestingly vitamin D, also
correlated with exercise.

141
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,895
So, if you were in the middle exercise
group, you were 5.148 higher in your

142
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,100
nmol per liter and your vitamin D compared
with the normal group.

143
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,100
The high exercise group was on average
7.072 nmol per liter higher in vitamin D.

144
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,660
So, if you're exercising a lot,

145
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,363
you tend to be outside more, you have
higher vitamin D levels again.

146
00:08:13,363 --> 00:08:14,873
It could be a confounder.

147
00:08:14,873 --> 00:08:18,467
Like more physical activity, better
cognitive function, and bigger vitamin D.

148
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:19,967
How about smoking?

149
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,054
okay.
Well, not surprisingly for smoking.

150
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:27,130
Smoking a binary variable, so it's easy to
interpret.

151
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,900
Vitamin D goes down with more smoking.

152
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,792
So, if you're a smoker, compared with a
non-smoker,

153
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:33,430
the reference group here is the
non-smoker.

154
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,360
The smokers are on average 10.95 nmol per
liter,

155
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,270
lower in their vitamin D levels than
non-smokers.

156
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,870
And also, notice that across all of the
cognitive scores,

157
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,970
your cognitive score goes down if you
smoke.

158
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,954
So, another potential confounder.

159
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:49,670
How about alcohol drinking?

160
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,970
Well, interestingly alcohol drinking is
correlated with slightly

161
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,510
higher cognitive function, at least on the
CTRM score, and the DSST score.

162
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,710
So, if you were a drinker, alcohol was put
it as a binary variable.

163
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,220
So, drinking at least one drink a day
versus less than that was correlated with

164
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,190
a slightly higher DSST score, 2.159 points
higher, and

165
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,960
that was statistically significant.

166
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,230
So, for some reason drinkers tend to have
slightly higher cognitive function.

167
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,645
It might not be due to the drinking,but
those tend to go together.

168
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:23,960
Similarly, drinkers tend to have a better
vitamin D level.

169
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,650
So, if you're a drinker versus
non-drinker,

170
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,450
your vitamin D level was 8.521 higher on
average.

171
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,321
So again, that one could be a confounder
too.

172
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,710
So, all there's many, many potential
confounders in this,

173
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,910
in this data set that need to be accounted
for.

174
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,320
Now, I'm going to jump to the heart of
this study.

175
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,230
The table that actually shows you the
relationship between vitamin D and

176
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,898
cognitive function which is what this
study was trying to get.

177
00:09:49,898 --> 00:09:52,142
Remember, this is cross sectional study.

178
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:55,238
I'm going to kind of walk you through this
table.

179
00:09:55,238 --> 00:09:59,920
Remember, the headlines said that this was
the strongest evidence yet

180
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,200
of a link between vitamin D level and
cognitive function.

181
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,460
So, let's see how strong that evidence is.

182
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,710
So, first of all, if you look at the first
row here,

183
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:14,760
I'm highlighting the CTRM test score and
the DSST score, because those are the two

184
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,340
that had a significant relationship with
vitamin D in this data set.

185
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,290
If you just adjust for age, which is what
that first row is.

186
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,990
This is the result of linear regression
with the cognitive score is the outcome

187
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,170
and vitamin D as the predictor, adjusted
for age only in that first row.

188
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,690
So, when you just adjust for age, there is
a statistically significant

189
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,350
relationship between vitamin D levels, and
both CTRM score and the DSST score.

190
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,600
It's not huge, but there's a relationship
there.

191
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,930
So, for example the 0.318 beta
coefficient,

192
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:51,680
the way we would interrupt that as is
every 10 nmol per liter increase in

193
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,231
your vitamin D levels, your DSST score
goes up by about a 3rd of a point.

194
00:10:57,231 --> 00:11:02,350
Just for comparison, remember that I made
some mock data sets.

195
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,960
The, the low, in that, in that, those mock
data sets,

196
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,200
the very low relationship when I had a
beta coefficient of 0.5.

197
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,424
So, this 0.318 represents an, an even
smaller relationship than,

198
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:20,080
than the lowest of those data sets I, the
hypothetical data sets.

199
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,320
I had a hypothetical data set with 0.5,
another one with 1.0,

200
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,170
and another with 1.5.

201
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,332
So, if you go back to those, that, that
very weak relationship was 0.5.

202
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:33,610
So, 0.318 is even lower than that, but it
is significant.

203
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,490
The next row represents, after you adjust
for a lot of things.

204
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,810
So, if you look at the footnote after you
adjust for age, education, depression,

205
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,205
body mass index, physical activity,
physical performance, smoking, alcohol,

206
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:47,930
center and season, all these potential
confounders identified in table two.

207
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,810
What happens to the estimates?

208
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,300
Well, look at CTRM test score, once you
adjust for

209
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,910
these confounders, it disappears
completely,

210
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,720
there's no relationship now between
vitamin D and CTRM test score.

211
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,980
That beta coefficient is essentially zero.

212
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,310
For DSST score, it does hang onto a small
relationship, but

213
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,550
notice that the beta coefficient has been
attenuated greatly.

214
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:13,860
When we adjust for these confounders, it
decreases by more than 50%.

215
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,170
And now, that beta coefficient is pretty
small.

216
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:24,160
It's a 0.15 point increase in DSST score
for every 10 nmol per liter in vitamin D.

217
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,370
That's a 10th of the hypothetical data set
I was showing you with the slope of 1.5,

218
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,630
which was kind of a moderate relationship.

219
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,990
So, it's a 10th of that relationship.

220
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,260
So, its really, really small.

221
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,360
It does hold on to a statistical
significance.

222
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,530
However, it's a small relationship.

223
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:44,070
And you have to remember that it really
gets attenuated when you adjust for

224
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,910
confounding here.

225
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,640
There's probably a lot of things that we
haven't adjusted for here.

226
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,010
And we haven't adjusted for them
perfectly.

227
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,400
So, a lot of that 0.15 is almost certainly
also due to confounding.

228
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,790
It's just that we haven't completely
adjusted for it.

229
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,750
So this is not a huge, this is not what I
would call, you know,

230
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:07,970
rocket evident, you know, great evidence
that that there's a huge link here.

231
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,750
This is also a cross-sectional study, so

232
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,820
we don't know the direction of the of the
causality, if there is any causality here.

233
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,420
It could be that if you have better
cognitive function, you go outside more,

234
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,480
you take better care of yourself.

235
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,510
And that's why your vitamin D is just a
little bit higher.

236
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,624
So, the direction of the effected course
is unknown here.

237
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:27,940
Just for practice, let's also look at the
vitamin D category.

238
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,290
So, besides looking at vitamin D as a
continuous predictor,

239
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,490
they also broke into potentially
clinically useful categories,

240
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,213
similar to what I did in, in an earlier
module.

241
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:40,670
They make four categories Sufficient,
Suboptimum, Insuffisient and Deficient.

242
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,690
And the Reference group is obviously the
Sufficient.

243
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,990
So, for example, the Deficient group the
data coefficient is negative 1.4.

244
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,021
So that would say that if you're in a, if
your deficient has a very low level of

245
00:13:55,021 --> 00:13:58,840
vitamin D, compared with normal, above 75,
or what see if what they're

246
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,002
calling sufficient, you are an average 1.4
points lower in your DSST score.

247
00:14:04,002 --> 00:14:08,444
That does remain statistically significant
after adjusting for all these confounders.

248
00:14:08,444 --> 00:14:14,390
But again, it's a fair, it's still a
fairly a small effect.

249
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,040
So, I, I wouldn't call this, you know,
huge evidence of a,

250
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:27,365
a great straw, big link between vitamin D
and, and cognitive function.
